Or--since one is a well-known and respected guest--one could go to the desk in the lobby and say "Miss Mayfield seems to have lost her room key--have you another"?  They always have another. +++$+++ 1990s

I'm tired of bingo, maybe we should try that drive in of yours. +++$+++ 1990s
Hello. +++$+++ 1990s
I can't! +++$+++ 1990s
You put me in an awkward position, Mr. Kessler. +++$+++ 1980s
Obviously, the British government denies all of this - +++$+++ 1990s
I suppose you gotta get up early, huh? +++$+++ 1990s
What's my problem? You want a list? +++$+++ 1990s
You mean you don't want to go? +++$+++ 1930s
He was fine when he left here, and now look at him. +++$+++ 1980s
What? +++$+++ 1990s
Wuddya mean, buddy? +++$+++ 1990s
I asked, but ya never helped nothin'! -- Like the Bible sez, ya don't get no second chance. +++$+++ 1970s
Do you know what a wire transfer is? +++$+++ 2000s
No.  They hired Bain.  The contract would have been mine, but Bain took it from me as he took the previous one. +++$+++ 1990s
Did you kill Yankees? +++$+++ 2000s
What do you think... you are sixteen years old on Hollywood Boulevard? +++$+++ 1990s
...You know that car? +++$+++ 1980s
Thank you. +++$+++ 2000s
How am I supposed to not get excited, listening to you trying to extort your employee, you sarcastic prick? +++$+++ 2000s
You never know who you'll see. +++$+++ 2000s
A undercover cop has got to be Marlon Brando. To do this job you got to be a great actor. You got to be naturalistic. You got to be naturalistic as hell. If you ain't a great actor you're a bad actor, and bad acting is bullshit in this job. +++$+++ 1990s
You seem to be very satisfied to have taken me alive ... +++$+++ 1960s
It was once worn by Louis the Sixteenth. They call it Le Coeur de la Mer, the -- +++$+++ 1990s
You know what I'm saying, Joe? +++$+++ 1990s
Marty! It's me. Paul. +++$+++ 1990s
...I want all the names of all the other people he had with him. And I don't care what you have to do to him to get 'em. You understand? +++$+++ 1990s
How you doing down there? +++$+++ 1980s
I know I wasn't a good husband, Hildy, but you can always count on me. +++$+++ 1940s
Am I suppose to be this sore? +++$+++ 1990s
Admiral, I asked you a question. +++$+++ 2000s
Remember the guy who cheated at the table? +++$+++ 1990s
I came to see you. How you feel? +++$+++ 1950s
Great. I'll go with you. Wait a second. Hey, Raul! Move that car, will you? +++$+++ 1980s
What killed them I won't even write about. I tell you, they'd do more than just harass me. They have the future to protect. +++$+++ 1990s
Systems check positive.  Look, Elaine, I... +++$+++ 1980s
It's me. I'm just going to water the dragon... +++$+++ 1980s
Can I be of service, Miss Price? +++$+++ 1980s
Maybe the reason she's with me is a little thing called integrity, Sayer.  Look it up. +++$+++ 2010s
Like you said, maybe somebody's tracking one of your investigations. +++$+++ 1990s
Like a real sister? +++$+++ 1980s
And how about three hundred cigarettes for yourself? +++$+++ 1950s
I don't know. I told you, this isn't my apartment. +++$+++ 1990s
Anyone at home? +++$+++ 1960s
WISH HE WAS MINE.  THAT HANDSOME BOY OVER THERE, THE ONE WITH THE WAVY HAIR. +++$+++ 1990s
If he did, why didn't he use his damn shotgun? +++$+++ 1990s
Now, when we get out there, you do what we say or it's curtains. If we say move, you move. If we say left, you move left. If we say right, you move right. If we say mole, you dig a hole. Got it? +++$+++ 1990s
Pack your shit! We gotta get outta here! We gotta get out! +++$+++ 1990s
Nothing to be sorry about.  That's the way with men and women, isn't it? +++$+++ 1990s
That's it?  That's it? That's it? +++$+++ 2000s
Have you heard of Jonas Salk? +++$+++ 1990s
You have orange whips? +++$+++ 1990s
...but he wasn't the real Doctor Lizardo...just this arachtoid creep that stole the good doc's body the year before in the Eighth Dimension when Prof. Hikita's lab exploded... +++$+++ 1980s
I'm sorry.  Would you like a taste? +++$+++ 2000s
Suits. I didn't tell them anything. You know anything about gears? +++$+++ 1990s
Yes, you did. +++$+++ 1980s
The Manzetti thing must have scared her. She thinks she'll get implicated. +++$+++ 2000s
We gotta call the police – +++$+++ 1990s
You threaten me with my uncle? After what I'm doing for you? +++$+++ 1980s
What do you want to talk about? +++$+++ 2000s
M'hm. Yeah. Yeah. +++$+++ 1970s
Don't know. Really. I grew up with him.  I've missed him too, but now, every time I see him, I get confused. Hardly a day goes by he's not in my mind. Even now, I feel he's here -- +++$+++ 2000s
Why? +++$+++ 1970s
Thought you swore you'd never Carry that thing again. +++$+++ 1990s
Just listen to this—  Adorable Babykins— Does her miss her Baby? Him sends his booful li'l sweetums a billion oceans full of kisses. Bobo is so lonely—! +++$+++ 1930s
...Well, I have the worst  headache, I have to go find some aspirin. But, call me, let's have a drink, I'm under Evelyn Waugh. +++$+++ 2000s
I'm having some people over tonight for dinner -- I'd like you come. +++$+++ 1990s
Okay then.  I'll do it. +++$+++ 1990s
Of course, the check, I had it with me all the time. +++$+++ 1960s
Yes, sir -- I guess I do -- Gee -- +++$+++ 2000s
The exact words of the text. But do you understand it ? Do you believe it ? +++$+++ 1990s
Yes. I have to agree. From all you've found so far, his position's as good as yours. +++$+++ 2000s
The old Indian burial ground. +++$+++ 1990s
She'll say, "Now my son is a man." +++$+++ 1990s
So, uh, where are you in school? +++$+++ 1980s
You have to believe me, I had no idea -- +++$+++ 2000s
Well ... make him keep quiet. +++$+++ 2000s
He could have been a great man -- a good man and a fine doctor, but there was always the shame of the old life and the old ways to hold him back -- and always Gray -- Gray to hound him to his death. +++$+++ 1940s
I'm going to return the bracelet right now and face the consequences. +++$+++ 1930s
Oh, yeah, you gotta start making the list. +++$+++ 1990s
Repeat that, Bill. +++$+++ 1990s
And now that Superman's out of the Nice Guy business... +++$+++ 1980s
Well, are you? +++$+++ 1980s
Sure, sure, give go. +++$+++ 1990s
The code's changed. We need Artoo! +++$+++ 1980s
You mean it's just lying around someplace -- all that cash? +++$+++ 1960s
Aye -- yet one such as I who has wandered this world for nearly nine centuries can remember back to other days of change.  Days of Robin of the Hood and Arthur Pendragon.  They were real enough once, but they drifted into men's dreams and became legend - - as we shall do one day. +++$+++ 1990s
I want it back. +++$+++ 1980s
Go ahead. +++$+++ 1980s
You. +++$+++ 2000s
Just met her on the boat--supposed to play bridge with her yesterday--but she wouldn't--so we played poker instead. +++$+++ 1930s
Relax, this guy owes me a big one. A couple years ago he got in a jam up in the Boston office; some bullshit about padding his resume -- like we haven't all done that. Anyway, they were going to let him go but his mother wrote a tear-jerker letter that ended up on my desk. +++$+++ 1990s
Don't you want to come along, darling? +++$+++ 1950s
Ohh! +++$+++ 1930s
It's a knocking-shop. Tres discreet, huh? He visits his ladies on Tuesday and Thursday nights and Saturday mornings. His security's in the car beyond. +++$+++ 1990s
What, been drunk? Sure! Plenty! +++$+++ 1980s
Tish-I'm-tee. +++$+++ 1980s
We're going to draw a little bit of everybody's blood. +++$+++ 1980s
Well, it seems to me... +++$+++ 1990s
What is this? +++$+++ 1930s
He came by. +++$+++ 1990s
Paul, since you brought her up, I have to ask you this, or I'd be drummed out of the agents' union-- what about a non-fiction book? The truth about what went on in that house. +++$+++ 1990s
Get him in here. +++$+++ 1990s
I told you.  I don't turn on the TV except for the fights. +++$+++ 1990s
Well, that was a very promising start. By my calculations, you should be starting to feel alright again. Yes? Dr. Brodsky's pleased with you. Now tomorrow there'll be two sessions, of course, morning and afternoon. +++$+++ 1970s
You've just decided, is that right? +++$+++ 1990s
...I just made a call about that. It'll look fine. +++$+++ 1980s
When it comes to this, you is the real thing--is that what you sayin'? +++$+++ 1990s
Hamish, I... thank... +++$+++ 1990s
Listen you little Asshole, I oughta -- +++$+++ 1980s
We weren't there.  The handbook says funerals aren't for the dead. +++$+++ 1980s
Look at 'em! Same yella han'bill-- 800 pickers wanted. Awright, this man wants 800 men. So he prints up 5,000 a them han'bills an' maybe 20,000 people sees 'em. An' maybe two-three thousan' starts movin, wes' account a this han'bill. Two- three thousan' folks that's crazy with worry headin' out for 800 jobs! Does that make sense? +++$+++ 1940s
A big difference, if someone found it we should keep looking, if they didn't we're just wasting our time. +++$+++ 1990s
Shut up a second... +++$+++ 1980s
Captain Mertin? +++$+++ 1990s
Don't turn away! Look at it! You're in this too— don't you see, don't you see? You're in this too, Father. +++$+++ 1950s
Makes you cry +++$+++ 1970s
Brian, let me come to the point. I'd like to offer you a job. +++$+++ 1990s
These dang things are heavy. Hard to carry, too. +++$+++ 1990s
You name it. +++$+++ 1960s
He's just a deep sleeper. +++$+++ 1980s
The pleasure is all mine. +++$+++ 1930s
It's good advice...  Say hi to Marcia for me. +++$+++ 2000s
Because...there is good in him. I've felt it. He won't turn me over to the Emperor. I can save him. I can turn him back to the good side. I have to try. +++$+++ 1980s
Did one of the officers work you over a little? +++$+++ 1990s
Oh, well, I can't . . . +++$+++ 1940s
Oh God.  Oh God. +++$+++ 1990s
It's the only name I've got. How about you? +++$+++ 1960s
I'll say that I'm travelling. +++$+++ 1980s
That'd be fine.  So, Claudia, lemme just say, so I can get my role of LAPD officer out of the way before we enjoy our coffee  I'm not gonna write you up or anything, I'm not gonna give you a citation here -- but the real problem we have is that there are people around here, people that work from their homes, people tryin' to get some work done, and if you're listenin' to your music that loud:  They're incovenienced by that.  If you had a job you'd probably understand, but I see you like listenin' to your music and that's fine, you're just gonna wanna keep it down at a certain volume, maybe memorize what number you see on the dial and just always put it to that -- If it's the middle of the day -- that's what I do -- just put it on two and a half and that's a good listening level, alright? I see you like listenin' to your music loud, but, hey, forget about the neighbors, you end up damaging your own ears ok? +++$+++ 1990s
Forensics people are sure of it. You have any idea who might have put him there? +++$+++ 1990s
Yesterday, you were a loan shark. +++$+++ 1990s
I...don't think so. +++$+++ 1990s
If that's what feels right. +++$+++ 2000s
How certain are you that you haven't been sick in your life? +++$+++ 2000s
Ready? +++$+++ 1930s
Ummm, hmmm... umm, hmmm...  Well, this looks very good.. Of course  ... you understand this is the worst time of the year to look for a job. +++$+++ 1970s
Didn't you have something a little more romantic in mind for your first time? +++$+++ 2000s
What, you think there's something funny about it? +++$+++ 2000s
Shit! Temp's dropping! We should have left this rock an hour ago! +++$+++ 2000s
S'up. +++$+++ 2000s
This party is sick. +++$+++ 2000s
How about a lift home? +++$+++ 1990s
What rank?  I believe Corporal Hicks has authority here. +++$+++ 1980s
I don't want to talk about it. Everything's okay now. I don't want to talk about it. +++$+++ 1990s
That's not the way we play the game. +++$+++ 1990s
Look again. +++$+++ 1990s
Sounds good.  Kim, would you get Heather and me a coffee?  How you like it, Hon? +++$+++ 1990s
Self sufficient... +++$+++ 1990s
Yes. +++$+++ 2000s
What smells like shoe polish? +++$+++ 1990s
Oh?  What's the problem? +++$+++ 1990s
Okay, everyone. +++$+++ 1990s
And you were drilling these holes...? +++$+++ 1990s
... Oh. +++$+++ 1970s
You mean not enough to save you. +++$+++ 2000s
Which maneuver, sir? The one in which I moved an entire living room set from one lawn to another, or the one in which I cleared a sixty-four ounce blue slushie in ten minutes? +++$+++ 2000s
I never met them. +++$+++ 1970s
Please, Nancy. Trust us. +++$+++ 1980s
Did you howl off-key at the moon again? +++$+++ 1960s
Oh, no, you were- +++$+++ 1990s
That is enough!  You are a good servant, d'Artagnan, but you forget your place! +++$+++ 1990s
See, I wouldn't think that about you. +++$+++ 2000s
Dad'll pick you up today, all right? +++$+++ 1990s
I said no. +++$+++ 1980s
There's some sort of lock here. You say these thing's are made of granite with a steel interior? +++$+++ 1990s
You'll wreck your raincoat. +++$+++ 1960s
Uh-huh. You're a scream, Lovey. +++$+++ 1930s
You look very pale, Truman.  Are you taking your vitamin D's? +++$+++ 1990s
Oh no, no, it's... it's wonderful.   It's... no, don't worry about it.  You're very funny.  Go back, that's great! +++$+++ 1980s
What's the matter?! You mad at me? +++$+++ 1960s
Come on. I died enough for one night. +++$+++ 1980s
Pops +++$+++ 1990s
I can't...I can't answer you just because you want me to answer you! +++$+++ 2000s
We'll have to catch it and eject it from the ship. +++$+++ 1970s
I think she wants me to come over to put me into the right position to check out her delicates, what ever that means. +++$+++ 2000s
Dark Town. Land of nightmares. I'm Bull. +++$+++ 2000s
Why not? This place is dead anyway. +++$+++ 1990s
This is a neurelyser. it was a gift from some friends from out of town. I need you to look at it.  This red eye here isolates and measures the nature of the electronic impulses currently in your brain.  More specifically, the ones -for memory, which it will then block.   I said I need you to look right here. +++$+++ 1990s
No. +++$+++ 1980s
NO, YOU STOP IT! Stop pretending like you care! Like this really isn't about you and Tom. +++$+++ 1990s
Okay.  Why don't you go out there. We'll check in with you later. +++$+++ 1990s
It would be impossible to discuss the subject without a common frame of reference. +++$+++ 1980s
And I'm not even pretty. +++$+++ 1950s
I'm just here about my brother. +++$+++ 2000s
Who's this guy she's gonna marry? +++$+++ 1940s
What's goin' on? +++$+++ 1950s
No matter. There's nothing I can do about it. +++$+++ 1990s
He's on to a new thing. He's after a guy who owns a gun shop he says is "woefully and wantonly" selling assault rifles to minors. He says he's gonna take him down if it's the last thing he does. +++$+++ 1990s
It's already out. +++$+++ 1990s
What's in your socks? +++$+++ 1960s
I do? +++$+++ 2010s
Not where I come from. +++$+++ 1990s
Amateurs 2 +++$+++ 1990s
Is everything ok? +++$+++ 2000s
Eventually she married a young physician. +++$+++ 1940s
Not with us in the fuckin' car! +++$+++ 2000s
Just came by to wrap up over there. Thought I'd say "hello." +++$+++ 2000s
He's sulking again. +++$+++ 1960s
They look like a bunch of good ol' boys to me. I guess it's oil money, huh? +++$+++ 1990s
No, I wanna kill my boss! +++$+++ 2000s
Off limits. +++$+++ 2000s
Jesus Christ.  Can you kill it? +++$+++ 1990s
Three whole weeks. +++$+++ 1950s
Macey... I've never seen you like this. +++$+++ 1990s
No, nothing. +++$+++ 1980s
That's enough.  That's enough. +++$+++ 1980s
Enough of this. We stay together. Let me rest, I will feel better then. +++$+++ 2000s
Bill...This is hard on all of us and it's no time for compliments. But I think it's extraordinary of you to come down here for this. +++$+++ 1980s
The last Sankara Stone. +++$+++ 1980s
It's about the leopard. +++$+++ 1940s
What do I need a thief for? I've got the Mask. +++$+++ 1990s
Who? +++$+++ 1980s
I am not involved.  Keep clicking your little wires.  You'll get someone else.  Good luck. +++$+++ 2000s
I hope you're right... +++$+++ 2000s
Are you? +++$+++ 1980s
My mother can't have any more kids. +++$+++ 1990s
That ain't my scene. If that's somethin' you into... +++$+++ 2000s
Wait for what? +++$+++ 1960s
You really don't get it.  This story gets filed.  Every time anyone writes anything about me -- they'll dig up these photos.  Newspapers last forever. I'll regret this forever. +++$+++ 1990s
I think you're taking it seriously enough for both of us. +++$+++ 1990s
You're right. +++$+++ 1990s
What kind of a crash was it? +++$+++ 1990s
That's news to me.  So it's over at Jesse's office? +++$+++ 1990s
Ladies first.  I insist. +++$+++ 2000s
Yes sir. +++$+++ 1980s
Not much story here. Just a bunch of kids cutting loose. +++$+++ 1990s
Well, if you don't mind me sayin' so, he sounds like a real asshole. +++$+++ 1990s
What? What could he do? +++$+++ 2000s
*What* view? +++$+++ 1990s
I don't think I can wait until tomorrow. This needs clearing up. +++$+++ 1990s
I just thought if I gave you a drink and fed you some dinner, you'd be so grateful you'd take me to a movie. +++$+++ 1950s
I was just discussing this whole Vomit thing with my friend Art Mooney.  Do you know him? +++$+++ 1990s
God, I can't believe there are so many cool people at this party. +++$+++ 1990s
Hello, Mr Crane. +++$+++ 2000s
That one's probably married.  Think of his kids.  His wife's pregnant... +++$+++ 2000s
One, because I have a job here and two because I live here-- +++$+++ 1990s
Bud Fox, I look at a hundred ideas a day. I choose one. +++$+++ 1980s
Sir, I came from the Chicago offices myself, and if I may say, sir, there are still some very good.... +++$+++ 2000s
Well, it's for a woman. +++$+++ 1980s
Tea? Who wants tea? Let's go out! This calls for a feast. You don't want tea, Papa. Let's go dancing. Papa loves parties, don't you? +++$+++ 1980s
What happened that night? +++$+++ 1980s
You're really pissing me off. +++$+++ 1990s
Come now.  You've seen the graffiti -- all over the city in the few hors it has taken your men to drop like plague victims. What about your turf, Top?  You don't seem to have ripped out anyone's heart yet. +++$+++ 1990s
None that I've ever known. I know nothing of God or the Devil, I have never seen a vision nor learnt a secret that would damn or save my soul. And as far as I know, after four hundred years I am the oldest living vampire in the world. +++$+++ 1990s
Well, we're not in the middle of nowhere, but we can see it from here. +++$+++ 1990s
--my God, Nick??? +++$+++ 2000s
Detective Carter from the Haddonfield P.D. +++$+++ 1990s
Fuck this shit! +++$+++ 1980s
North, actually.  How'd you   ? +++$+++ 1990s
None shall pass. +++$+++ 1970s
Equipoise! Equipoise! What did I tell you, Animal? +++$+++ 1950s
Of what? +++$+++ 1990s
Good. I've always said you were wasting your time in the underwear department. +++$+++ 1950s
You're not telling me something. +++$+++ 1990s
Because I'm getting fat. +++$+++ 1980s
What do you care? +++$+++ 2000s
Twelve Young, answer the radio. I have a call for you. +++$+++ 1990s
You almost ended my career before it began. +++$+++ 2000s
Mrs. Leeds' fingernails and toenails. I think he took off his gloves, Jack.  And dust all the corneas of all their eyes. +++$+++ 1980s
But I am Barbara. I didn't die. +++$+++ 1940s
I'll be able to keep my apartment and studio, won't I?...  Just tell me. +++$+++ 1990s
Give it to me!  Yes! +++$+++ 1990s
He totally freaked.  I've never seen him like this.  He's out of his fucking mind. +++$+++ 1990s
We can hardly make a profit with them.  Up-front salary, back-end deal, perks, per diem, percentages -- They're mocking us, Elaine. We're at their mercy.  We always had movie stars but they used to be our stars.  We used to decide who would play what role. We told them what to wear, what to say, who to date.  When they were under contract, we could change their names if we wanted to -- more than once! +++$+++ 2010s
I need the main wet-wall. +++$+++ 1990s
No "buts." Go to your room now. +++$+++ 2000s
You my partner? +++$+++ 1990s
Yeah... +++$+++ 1970s
Call me Les. +++$+++ 1970s
No, Alfredo, I was coming to help you... +++$+++ 1980s
WALKED RIGHT INTO IT. +++$+++ 1980s
Well, don't go. +++$+++ 1970s
I went back to Watts to sell my old car and met her on the way.  Worst day of my life. +++$+++ 2000s
I was afraid that might happen. +++$+++ 1990s
Definitely. +++$+++ 1990s
What it was like when you died in the fire... +++$+++ 2000s
No. +++$+++ 2000s
You want to hit the town tonight? +++$+++ 1990s
What -- +++$+++ 2000s
"She was nice."  Wow.  That makes me all soft inside.  Ever occur to you she didn't love you back? +++$+++ 2000s
Let's go talk first, Adam. +++$+++ 1990s
Oh, man, you're not going to fall for that. +++$+++ 1990s
Okay, let's go in. +++$+++ 2000s
Christ! +++$+++ 1980s
Two:  There's nothing out there but noble gasses and carbon compounds and you'd be wasting your time. +++$+++ 1990s
What?! +++$+++ 2000s
Everybody makes their own fun.  F'you don't make it yourself, it ain't fun, it's entertainment. +++$+++ 2000s
So have we! +++$+++ 1940s
That's why Smith called you MacLeod. +++$+++ 1980s
And one of 'em is sick. +++$+++ 1940s
They were stained. +++$+++ 1980s
No -- Mama doesn't dream about you any more, Walter. You wouldn't know the old girl now. +++$+++ 1940s
But, Victor, if the situation were different, if I had to stay and there were only a visa for one, would you take it? +++$+++ 1940s
Damn it, Mom. I told you I need them all! +++$+++ 2000s
He was in love with me every day for nine years.  I can make him happier than she can. +++$+++ 1990s
Terri? +++$+++ 1990s
What?... Oh, right, you can see these guys too. Jesus... +++$+++ 1990s
What's that? +++$+++ 1980s
We're on. +++$+++ 2000s
I understand.  You're upset.  You want to know what's going on.  That's good. +++$+++ 2000s
-- we can go -- I can get us out of here -- but we have to go now -- +++$+++ 2000s
That's big of you, Bob. +++$+++ 1980s
Maybe you oughta give me lessons. +++$+++ 1960s
Straight-A brainiac! +++$+++ 1990s
Prevacid.  For my stomach. +++$+++ 2000s
Yeah, I've seen him. +++$+++ 1990s
She doesn't want to Bare Her Breasts. +++$+++ 2000s
Oh yes.  Why, you told me to sell them a long time ago. +++$+++ 1930s
That why you tried to put a bullet in my head in the middle of the desert. +++$+++ 1990s
Well, who is your lord? +++$+++ 1970s
You bet. +++$+++ 1980s
I think I could cobble something together.  A long metal rod with a battery in it.  Give it a hell of a shock. +++$+++ 1970s
Look at this!  "Hillside Strangler gets his college degree in prison!" +++$+++ 1990s
Have you got a license? +++$+++ 1930s
Now, that's American music. +++$+++ 1990s
Yes. I know. Still in the dumps, huh? +++$+++ 1930s
-- Yeah... your car down here? +++$+++ 1970s
Li Mu Bai giving up his sword and his warrior days... maybe he's trying to tell you something? +++$+++ 2000s
Clean. +++$+++ 1990s
Why sure, boy, sure. +++$+++ 1950s
The subject got emotionallv disturbed; he just dropped out. There's thousands. +++$+++ 1970s
Alex! +++$+++ 1990s
You believe that? +++$+++ 1990s
Forensic ballistics isn't an exact science, is it? +++$+++ 1980s
No, it's the whole idea behind it. How did they get this place? +++$+++ 2000s
Roger that. +++$+++ 2000s
Yes, ma'am. Are we the closest PD? +++$+++ 1990s
Hmm. +++$+++ 2000s
I believe I was successful in communicating our intentions. +++$+++ 1980s
Fresh guy, huh! What you need is a good sock on the nose. +++$+++ 1930s
We did not. +++$+++ 2000s
Well, I've been accused of many things, Mrs. Mulwray, but never that. +++$+++ 1970s
Unable to escape, she turns and attacks the killer, but doesn't connect. +++$+++ 1990s
Well, sure.  So would I.  So would you. I wouldn't worry about it.  We'll get it right one of these days. +++$+++ 1990s
Damnit to hell, you left me back there to die! +++$+++ 2000s
Good point.  Especially that dude you were with.  I'd like to see him down front. +++$+++ 1990s
Probably.  One of the many. +++$+++ 2000s
I've been trying to reach you but you haven't returned... +++$+++ 1990s
Hello, Exposition. +++$+++ 1990s
This is who you were. Exactly who you are is up to you. +++$+++ 1990s
Tonight and every night, my friend, for this is the second time you've saved my life.  I am Ergo the Magnificent, short in stature, tall in power, etcetera, etcetera. +++$+++ 1980s
I see. +++$+++ 1980s
A mortician.  He seemed to know a hell of a lot more about death than he ever told us. +++$+++ 2000s
What else's he goin to do with his day, he can't work, and he won't steal... +++$+++ 2000s
Thanks for coming to get us. Little brother almost scared us to death. +++$+++ 2000s
I think I can remember what's on them. +++$+++ 2000s
I don't give a damn about the money. I want you, and I want to get us out of this shithole.  There's only one way to do that. +++$+++ 1970s
-- we'll tell them what happened -- +++$+++ 2000s
He seemed like a nice guy, Alex. +++$+++ 1990s
Stay here?!  What's the matter with you, Bob? You've been acting strangely ever since we came here.  I've never seen you like this. Why can't we leave? What's stopping us? +++$+++ 1930s
Me, too.  I'm getting married tomorrow. +++$+++ 1990s
Allo... Salvatore... +++$+++ 1970s
A charming term.  Now, <u>why him</u>? +++$+++ 1990s
She did, huh. +++$+++ 1990s
Go on. Nothing can hurt you. Remember, this is only a movie. You're completely safe. +++$+++ 2000s
May I have some water? I'm thirsty. +++$+++ 1940s
I... +++$+++ 2000s
All right. +++$+++ 2000s
What's the trick here ? +++$+++ 2000s
I don't know. Who do you want? +++$+++ 2000s
But, Lily-- +++$+++ 1930s
What are you going to do about it, shoot me? +++$+++ 1990s
There.  And don't you dare tell me that wasn't a proper kiss! +++$+++ 2000s
Juice? +++$+++ 1990s
That's the point -- this could change things. +++$+++ 1990s
Get out of here. +++$+++ 2000s
He stuck it in the ball return machine when he was a kid. Crushed all the nerve endings. Junior starts stroking the ketchup bottle with his dead hand. +++$+++ 1990s
That's some nerve! +++$+++ 1950s
Lisa -- there's something terribly wrong. +++$+++ 1950s
Oh, I had the radio on. +++$+++ 1970s
Nothing. +++$+++ 2000s
Now.  Wait.  You didn't actually sign with Sugar, did you? Tell me you didn't sign.  Because I'm still sort of moved by your "my word is stronger'n oak" thing -- +++$+++ 1990s
All of the sudden, I'm feeling kind of nervous.  God, I hate blind dates.  Why couldn't we just have arranged marriages in America? +++$+++ 1990s
Anyway, Claire slept with him... +++$+++ 2000s
Nobody could attack you.  You set your life up like one of your chessboards. You're impregnable -- but at the same time you've become trapped behind your own defenses.  You're cut off from everyone around you. +++$+++ 1990s
We were in love but I'm not sure I know what love is anymore. +++$+++ 1980s
Billy... What the hell's wrong with you? +++$+++ 1980s
... You worried everything all right now and we'll have to go home? +++$+++ 1990s
It's twitching but it's below the line you said was safe. +++$+++ 1980s
Yeah... +++$+++ 1980s
It's the big potato. +++$+++ 2000s
He'll be back soon. +++$+++ 2000s
I didn't leave.  I was just digging around. +++$+++ 1990s
I talk to her or you can forget about it. +++$+++ 1990s
Well I'm going to major in Business Administration and, I think, minor in Communications. +++$+++ 2000s
Why don't you get it? He's going to kill us all! +++$+++ 2000s
At the seven-eleven. +++$+++ 1990s
I guess I've come to quite a place. +++$+++ 2000s
And what if they meet a monster in their dream? Then what? +++$+++ 1980s
Lynch him! Lynch him! +++$+++ 1950s
I don't know... +++$+++ 1990s
Whoops. +++$+++ 1980s
What was that, I didn't hear... +++$+++ 1970s
Tell me. +++$+++ 1990s
I tried him, he can't go.  His son is being Bar Mitzvohed tomorrow... I'll go, boss. +++$+++ 1980s
From now on, we'll share Marla. We've been spending too much time apart... +++$+++ 1990s
What's the matter with him. I never saw Nick act like that before. +++$+++ 1940s
Now get this mug. You've got the kind of chin I just love to touch. And if you don't get out of here, I'm going to hang one right on it. +++$+++ 1930s
Don't worry about it. +++$+++ 1990s
We were in love... weren't we? +++$+++ 2000s
What things? +++$+++ 1980s
I'll call you. +++$+++ 1980s
Of course. How am I gonna forgive him after what he did?! +++$+++ 1990s
Be my guest. +++$+++ 1980s
Let's try this way!  Holy Maker. +++$+++ 1970s
Hello, Grandfather! +++$+++ 1960s
Oh my! Oh my... Maybe you better come out now, Miss Starling. +++$+++ 1990s
Donut, get your camera. See if it's broke. +++$+++ 1990s
Thank you. +++$+++ 1980s
That's what you have to say? How could it be true? I never even heard of any procedure like this. It's a joke. +++$+++ 2000s
I looked everywhere, honey, but all I could find was your hat. +++$+++ 1990s
Yes...  well, there's one more stage -- trying to figure out if it's any good. +++$+++ 1990s
In my absence, try not to sell cigarettes to any newborns. +++$+++ 1990s
Just come down to my place of business, for god's sake.  I have people here. +++$+++ 1980s
Boss, we better roll if we're going to hit this place, blow it up, and make that flight.. +++$+++ 2000s
Can I have this? +++$+++ 1950s
You have a name, missy? +++$+++ 2000s
Mr. Scott, all power to the weapons systems -- +++$+++ 1980s
I must go. I'm in a hurry. +++$+++ 2000s
Ready for what?  What are you supposed to be doing? +++$+++ 1990s
That is an affirmative. I have victory dance. Mmmmmmm. +++$+++ 1990s
Well, there are, but for some reason they stop working at five-fourteen every night. +++$+++ 1990s
I don't know what you're talking about -- Get fucked -- +++$+++ 1970s
Tell him I'm sorry, ok, yes, you do that, now, I'm sorry, tell him, for all the things I've done...I fucked up and I'm sorry.... And I'm Gonna Turn Away And Walk Now And Not Look At Him Not See My Man, My Earl, I'll leave now...and tell him it's ok and I'm ok. The whole thing was ok with me -- and I know. +++$+++ 1990s
These are good. +++$+++ 2000s
He saved our lives. +++$+++ 1980s
I can't imagine how you ever let a man like that go.  I owe Viktor everything. +++$+++ 2010s
Hmmmm..... +++$+++ 1990s
She don't look Jewish. +++$+++ 1980s
Everyone takes his turn. +++$+++ 1980s
Then what'd you come here for? +++$+++ 1980s
Don't, Paul -- don't doubt yourself -- don't make me doubt you. +++$+++ 1940s
That's Daddy! +++$+++ 1950s
Well, thank you for all your help, Mrs. Johnson. +++$+++ 1990s
So? +++$+++ 1980s
I'll say.  This is solid gold. +++$+++ 1950s
Yeah? +++$+++ 1980s
No, no! I won't sign any pa- pers. You can't make me-- +++$+++ 1980s
‘That which does not kill me makes me stronger.’ +++$+++ 1990s
I'm not finished. I'll only be in port one week a month and when I'm here you'd never catch me playing daddy with you 'cause it's not who I am. Like I told you on the phone, you I'd be better off in that state school back in Virginia. +++$+++ 1980s
Yeah. +++$+++ 1990s
I don't know. +++$+++ 2000s
Well, I hope that you and your wife can come to the I.A.C. conference in June. +++$+++ 1960s
All right!  What'd she say? +++$+++ 1980s
Leo, I don't know. +++$+++ 1990s
Ninety. +++$+++ 1980s
'"... or I'll huff and I'll puff and I'll blow your house down!" And inside their new house, the three little pigs just laughed -- ' +++$+++ 1980s
So what do we do? +++$+++ 1990s
Don't even start, old man. +++$+++ 1990s
What is it? +++$+++ 1960s
Look, I'm just going to come right out and tell you why I'm here, okay? +++$+++ 1980s
I'm so close I can feel it. +++$+++ 2000s
My sister - My ADOPTED SISTER - +++$+++ 1990s
Fuck!  Fuck!  Fuck! +++$+++ 1990s
Where is she then? +++$+++ 2000s
If you're going to be indiscreet, I wish you'd be a little more discreet about it. Rich men, like Winton, love you and leave you. +++$+++ 1930s
You're Ro'tin, aren't you...? There's something in the voice.  Would you be his friend Gal'na?  I helped your mother bathe you when you were a child. She still speaks of you. +++$+++ 1990s
Got it, teach. +++$+++ 2000s
What? +++$+++ 1990s
Watch my stuff. +++$+++ 2000s
But what happens when they do find out? +++$+++ 1990s
No! Not the camera guy! +++$+++ 1990s
The swamp, most likely... Lombardo's a swamp rat, knows the body will never be found there.  But he's made a mistake. +++$+++ 1990s
What? What is it? +++$+++ 2000s
I couldn't say. +++$+++ 1970s
Suit yourself, kid. This isn't for me to decide. Of course, you could make a later train and still be in Albany tomorrow morning. +++$+++ 1940s
Because my boyfriend, who I thought was in America, is in fact in the next room. +++$+++ 1990s
Oui. Nathan's silk suit, just like you asked. +++$+++ 2000s
Catch a movie? Miniature Golf? +++$+++ 1980s
Please, you jump in some guy's face, talk smack and you get a pat on your ass.  But because I'm a female, I get told to calm down and act like a "lady".  I'm a ballplayer, okay.  A ball player. +++$+++ 2000s
Awright.  Get into position.  I'm rolling. +++$+++ 1990s
Somebody has to do it. +++$+++ 1980s
Here he comes. +++$+++ 1990s
I think someone broke into my house. +++$+++ 1990s
-- the James Dean wannabe with the hair trigger -- +++$+++ 1990s
Well, we want good stuff. +++$+++ 1980s
Fine.  Phil, you still there? +++$+++ 1990s
I'm Allison, you're 'honey'. +++$+++ 1990s
I know that girl! +++$+++ 1940s
I'm excused. +++$+++ 1980s
But then when will we see each other? +++$+++ 1960s
Rambo and Brewer were selected as write-offs. +++$+++ 1980s
Yes. +++$+++ 1980s
Sparkling apple cider? +++$+++ 1990s
Me! +++$+++ 1980s
Why do you do it if it hurts so bad? +++$+++ 1970s
Special Agent Jones. +++$+++ 2000s
No further questions. +++$+++ 1990s
Who do you think I'm doing this for? I'm doing this for you! +++$+++ 1990s
Do Peter Sellers again. +++$+++ 2000s
Ellie, we can tear up the rule book on cold-bloodedness. It doesn't apply, they're totally wrong!  This is a warm-blooded creature.  They're totally wrong. +++$+++ 1990s
Yes. +++$+++ 1980s
We're late. +++$+++ 2000s
My husband can't know about this. +++$+++ 1990s
The only girlish thing you have lost. +++$+++ 1960s
Stay away from me... +++$+++ 1980s
I was just somewhere else -- how did I get here? +++$+++ 2000s
Six. +++$+++ 1990s
Call the motor pool and authorise personal transport. +++$+++ 1980s
I think I'd better go tomorrow. +++$+++ 1960s
He's allergic. +++$+++ 2000s
Leon could still have hung himself. +++$+++ 1990s
No lightspeed? +++$+++ 1980s
Too late for what? +++$+++ 1970s
If Rick has the letters, he's much too smart to let you find them there. +++$+++ 1940s
We know you were with her. +++$+++ 1990s
...Would you, would you call him up. I'll give you my number, and ask him... +++$+++ 1980s
I don't know. +++$+++ 2000s
I don't know. I really don't. +++$+++ 1990s
What do you think has happened to your son, Mrs Spitz? +++$+++ 1990s
You know who The Raincoats are? +++$+++ 1990s
What do you feel like singing, Bob? +++$+++ 2000s
Cool.  Is there a menu?  Or buffet? +++$+++ 1990s
Just "lay back, Mack"... lay back... +++$+++ 1980s
And why is it a vacant exercise? +++$+++ 2000s
I know.  I just like to see you get all worked up. +++$+++ 1980s
It's a folk song. +++$+++ 1990s
Not at first. Oh yes, a few sparrows out for kicks... +++$+++ 1960s
This is a mistake. We better forget it. +++$+++ 1980s
[Me, too. Tell me about the guardians.] +++$+++ 2000s
Snoopy.  Christ, I thought he'd be brain dead by now. +++$+++ 1990s
So what's up?  What'd I miss? +++$+++ 1980s
I bet Scraps is going to love Mercury. +++$+++ 1980s
For the last time, put them on the table. +++$+++ 1940s
Bothers everybody who works there, but to me... It was... +++$+++ 1970s
Each inch represents 150 miles... +++$+++ 1990s
If they was just here for the fuckin', how come they lit out the back window? +++$+++ 1990s
Chill.  We don't want your face coming off with it. +++$+++ 1990s
What's going on here? +++$+++ 2000s
If Laszlo and the cause mean so much to you, you won't stop at anything. All right, I'll make it easier for you. +++$+++ 1940s
YOU are the one that decided to climb into this -- +++$+++ 1990s
Oh yes!  Who could forget.  Afterwards you sent me that amazing case of Chateau Lafitte. +++$+++ 1990s
Don't be shy.  There's time to stop before you go too far. +++$+++ 1990s
What're you afraid's going to happen? +++$+++ 2000s
The attacks are unceasing: by night, the Dark Ones; by day, those of our people who have sold themselves to them, those traitors who are called the Slayers. +++$+++ 1980s
Oh, yeah? +++$+++ 1990s
Well, don't you somewhere? Stuff? Belongings? +++$+++ 2000s
Where were you? You said you'd be back at twelve. +++$+++ 1980s
No!  Ditto the professor- +++$+++ 1980s
If I did-I don't-now. +++$+++ 1990s
I don't care.  Hank.  End it. +++$+++ 1990s
Very funny. Very funny. +++$+++ 1940s
Kevin?  Do you not love me? +++$+++ 1990s
Please!  I want to help you. Let me help you. +++$+++ 1980s
No.... +++$+++ 1990s
Not that.  Anything else. +++$+++ 1990s
Well, keep your <u>wits</u> about you, and let's see if we can't... +++$+++ 1990s
But... what about Starks? +++$+++ 2000s
It's very possible Ordell's killed somebody. +++$+++ 1990s
Well, George, I invest for a lot of people. I make a lot of money for them. More than they could do for themselves. +++$+++ 1970s
And why is that? Has something happened? +++$+++ 1990s
But Greta say -- +++$+++ 1990s
Fire insurance! +++$+++ 1930s
Maybe... look -- just... +++$+++ 1990s
It must feel great. +++$+++ 1970s
What's wonderful about the air, James? +++$+++ 1990s
I'm genuinely happy that you found some peace, Nancy. But you can't forgive for Liz.  No one can.  And you can't forgive for me. +++$+++ 2000s
They're gonna dig up stuff from your past, they're gonna throw it at you. I got to know what they're gonna throw. You understand? +++$+++ 1990s
Yes, sir. But he still feels his people should share in the increased profits of our news division. He has proposed an additional 500 million dollar payment. +++$+++ 1990s
She's been without therapy up here and I will not allow her to ruin... +++$+++ 1980s
When? When are you going to do it? +++$+++ 1950s
Is she responsible for the punch? +++$+++ 1970s
For that I'd kill a nun on Easter Sunday. +++$+++ 1970s
Nothing. As before. +++$+++ 1980s
Y'know, the guys in robbery are gonna get kind of upset.  We're stepping on their toes of this one. +++$+++ 1990s
Gee, guys, what should I do? The car or Debbie? +++$+++ 1980s
I think you better tell us. +++$+++ 1990s
What you run out on me for!  What you leave me alone for? +++$+++ 1950s
The whole town's gone crazy. +++$+++ 1940s
I'm frightened, Mitch. +++$+++ 1960s
He's dead. They're both dead. You don't understand what is on this ship. This is a being that kills. That's what he does. That's all he does. And he is very good at it. +++$+++ 2000s
Yeah you are and you hate it.  You hate the fact that your hand is shaking and mine isn't.  That you're sweating your balls off and I'm not. You've got fear and hate in your belly like battery acid, all because of me. +++$+++ 1990s
Oh God, what did you say, you dumb bitch? +++$+++ 2000s
You win some, you loose some. +++$+++ 1990s
Actually, these tests weren't available twenty years ago. +++$+++ 2000s
Sam, let me ask you a question. You must really trust your wife. +++$+++ 1990s
That's a wolf's head. +++$+++ 1980s
Stop saying the word!  The word we cannot hear!  The word ... +++$+++ 1970s
But Pappy, they's inter-grated. +++$+++ 2000s
Jeff, if you're squeamish, just don't look. +++$+++ 1950s
Christ, Michael - what the hell are we doing...?  We don't even know - +++$+++ 1990s
Ten thousand francs for each one. +++$+++ 2000s
I don't know what he's told you --  What <u>has</u> he told you?  Would you like to tell <u>me</u> -- ? +++$+++ 1950s
Where is it? +++$+++ 2000s
Mr Poe? +++$+++ 1970s
I knew it.  What does she know.  You want me to sing something? +++$+++ 2000s
Where's he? +++$+++ 1970s
He's a freelance subversive? +++$+++ 1980s
Elena, what are you're talking about? +++$+++ 1990s
Get up!! +++$+++ 2000s
Oh, no sir. Certainly not. Anyway, it's none of my business -- four apples, five apples -- what's the difference -- percentage-wise? +++$+++ 1960s
Yes, perfect.  As a matter of fact, I ran into Simone on the lot the other day. +++$+++ 2010s
Yeah, well we're still a little young for Albany State Prison. Are you pissed about Al? I'm pissed too, but I'm not like "twenty-five to life" pissed. +++$+++ 2000s
Are you crazy? +++$+++ 1990s
Is this slow enough for you? +++$+++ 1980s
New guy... +++$+++ 1980s
... And do give me some room, Voltaire.  You're breathing on my head!  I hate it when you breath on my head! +++$+++ 1990s
No. +++$+++ 2000s
I just heard them Karl. +++$+++ 1970s
So what? +++$+++ 2000s
Who pays for them? +++$+++ 1980s
I tell you, I could fly around this room with my eyes closed! +++$+++ 1990s
The Russians. On the other side of the river.  All you have to do is hang on for a few more weeks. +++$+++ 2000s
... well I'm glad you told me. +++$+++ 1970s
Meaning my house. +++$+++ 2000s
Wish I could help, Sheriff.  But if you'll excuse me I'm going over to Harlin's to pick up my car.  Then I'm getting the hell out of this place. +++$+++ 1970s
You would not...? +++$+++ 1970s
Honey? +++$+++ 2000s
Go on - you can have one! +++$+++ 1960s
You want a muffin? +++$+++ 1990s
Ok, now that that's over with...what are you gonna make me for breakfast? +++$+++ 1980s
I can handle it. +++$+++ 1990s
It's cold. +++$+++ 1990s
What?! +++$+++ 2000s
Tell me... +++$+++ 1990s
DON'T touch me.  Just get away from me. Go! +++$+++ 2000s
There's not much horsepower left in the engines, but there's enough noise...once this baby's set...I'll rev it up...that slimy bastard will come for it like candy... +++$+++ 1990s
I'm gonna need that hand back, Ed. +++$+++ 1990s
Funded by whom? +++$+++ 1990s
Free, if you're the president. +++$+++ 1990s
I'm just trying to find...  Who owns this store? +++$+++ 1970s
I haven't. No. +++$+++ 1960s
No. +++$+++ 1980s
The new vehicle, plus forty thousand dollars. +++$+++ 1990s
Dropped him, that was it.  Sorry If I made a worse mess for you. +++$+++ 1990s
Merry, how... oh, Christ, of course, you had my phone tapped. +++$+++ 1990s
Thanks for the vote of confidence. +++$+++ 1980s
I was a friend of Harry Lime. +++$+++ 1940s
Because this is important -- so don't just be polite.  I'd really like to look...what's the word I'm looking for?... +++$+++ 1980s
If you graduate. +++$+++ 1980s
Can't get a little bit pregnant, Bud. +++$+++ 1980s
Love a cup of tea. With lemon. +++$+++ 1970s
I like to travel.... +++$+++ 1980s
Okay. We're all here. Today's Wednesday. D-Day is Friday night ... That gives us two days to prep ... We're going to find the ladies on our list, find out where they live, when they're home; that they're properly insured ... Let's get into the vans -- +++$+++ 2000s
Captain... we've got less than ten minutes before that Vulcan ship leaves the system. We've got to go <U>now</U>. +++$+++ 1990s
I don't know. +++$+++ 1980s
Don't get premature on me, Jimmy. We don't light up 'til the Fat Lady sings. +++$+++ 1990s
Ilsa... you're alright? +++$+++ 1990s
I'm an old friend of Cochrane's... I wanted to see how he was doing. +++$+++ 1990s
Yeah. There was this cloud and I video taped it. +++$+++ 1990s
Mrs. Dudley'll be waiting for you. +++$+++ 1990s
No. The fetus was dead. Her uterus was virtually *disintegrating*--my stitches pulled right through the tissue! +++$+++ 1990s
I'm never unfair. +++$+++ 1940s
If they crash, maybe he'll run.  You can shoot him in the leg or something. +++$+++ 2000s
Okay, so we got a state trooper pulls someone over, we got a shooting, and these folks drive by, and we got a high-speed pursuit, ends here, and this execution-type deal. +++$+++ 1990s
Well, Mr. Cosgrove, I'll answer you point by point.  The King is exceedingly averse to make peers, as you know.  Your claim, as you call them, have been laid before him, and His Majesty's gracious reply was, that you were the most impudent man in his dominions, and merited a halter, rather than a coronet.  As for withdrawing your support from us, you are perfectly welcome to carry yourself whithersoever you please.  And, now, as I have a great deal of occupation, perhaps you will do me the favor to retire, or tell me if there is anything else in the world in which I can oblige you. +++$+++ 1970s
I'm not, you know. +++$+++ 1990s
There's a place over there on the bluffs. When the fog is just right, like tonight, the lights of Main look like a kaleidoscope. +++$+++ 2000s
That's the whole idea of living in the country.  I thrive on the seclusion. +++$+++ 1990s
Remember, he's the son of a Senator, so go easy. Kid gloves. +++$+++ 2000s
So was I.  The usual investigation turns up nothing more times than not. +++$+++ 1990s
If I don't 'grow up...' +++$+++ 1980s
Jim, you've got to let me go in there! Don't leave him in the hands of Twentieth Century medicine. +++$+++ 1980s
This isn't Mr. Goodman's idea. He is your good friend, whereas I am a victim of your carnivorous lunar activities. +++$+++ 1980s
Got him here? +++$+++ 1990s
Age is a limit we impose upon ourselves. You know, each time you Westerners celebrate your birthday, you build another fence around your minds. +++$+++ 1930s
Why yes.  I met you at the dog races -- say, you could have won that race if you tried a little harder. +++$+++ 1930s
Great.  Well, I'm sure glad that's settled, aren't you? +++$+++ 1980s
I think if anybody had a hand in killing Hocker, you ought to ask or you should have asked Emory and Chick. +++$+++ 1990s
Really think so? +++$+++ 1970s
It's important! +++$+++ 1980s
Special Needs class. +++$+++ 2000s
What are you talking about? I don't understand all this mumbo jumbo and the funny looks on your faces. +++$+++ 1990s
Oh, no. Just right. Your age fits you. Yes, sir, you look a little older without your clothes on. +++$+++ 1940s
I'm falling!  I'm going to fall! +++$+++ 1990s
My bourbon. +++$+++ 1980s
Maybe.  but maybe not.  We still don't have anything linking this to PG&E corporate. Plus, there's the statute problem.  Plus, we're way short on manpower, so we'd need to bring on more lawyers ... +++$+++ 2000s
Yeah, well I wouldn't expect too much. +++$+++ 1990s
Very well. +++$+++ 2000s
Those who I deem unworthy to pass through this camp will quit, and those who refuse to quit I will kill. You ever hear of a training accident -- give me a sir, yes, sir! +++$+++ 2000s
No you won't. +++$+++ 2000s
That's not news, Zoe. +++$+++ 1990s
Are you able to back up this allegation -- or are you fishing? +++$+++ 1990s
It's right on Hawthorne Boulevard and Manhattan Beach Boulevard. It's red brick... +++$+++ 1990s
No, they didn't say -- +++$+++ 1990s
Oh, I can't remember.  But people do have bad dreams when their routine is disturbed. +++$+++ 1950s
No, No -- I -- I just thought you hurt yourself. +++$+++ 1930s
I heard his voice as clear as day. I better get back. Maybe something is wrong. +++$+++ 1990s
Yes? +++$+++ 1990s
My friend Monsieur Philipe is a friend of Florentino. +++$+++ 1990s
...Were you? +++$+++ 2000s
I'll need the sergeant's okay on that. +++$+++ 2000s
Yes, sir. +++$+++ 1990s
No and I don't plan on sticking around either. +++$+++ 1990s
The sooner we do this the better, Mr. Baker. +++$+++ 1980s
I gave you my card there. +++$+++ 1990s
The NSA thinks the UN is onto your work... +++$+++ 1990s
Dead end--it's a clone.  What about the Mustang? +++$+++ 2000s
Perfect. +++$+++ 2000s
Like I had to say it? No, I wanted to say it. +++$+++ 1980s
Oh, yeah?  Then how'd you find my house? +++$+++ 1980s
Really? You'd do that for me? +++$+++ 2000s
Would you like a sandwich? +++$+++ 1970s
Frankly sir, you look a little like my father. Probably explains the curious feeling of love I have for you. +++$+++ 1980s
No, it's fine.  I'm fine. +++$+++ 2000s
Change lanes.  Then watch your rearview. +++$+++ 1990s
As of this moment you're six years old... +++$+++ 1950s
Swim for it! +++$+++ 1970s
Blue Five, does that glare bother you? +++$+++ 1970s
I'm making a mess. +++$+++ 1990s
Hey, another one for me and another one for the lady. +++$+++ 1960s
Which one's the Colonel's? +++$+++ 1970s
Goodnight, Ike, we're all going to bed. +++$+++ 1990s
But I'm not joking. +++$+++ 1940s
No. +++$+++ 1940s
But your men are watching over Yu's compund? +++$+++ 2000s
When I thought about you I was mostly hating you. Where've you been hiding? +++$+++ 1990s
All right, look, if he took a break, it would just give everybody some time to maneuver. That's all I'm saying. It's all that I'm saying. +++$+++ 1990s
Fiction or non-fiction? +++$+++ 1960s
Nothing yet. +++$+++ 2000s
Forget it.  I was joking. +++$+++ 1980s
Then... Where the hell are we? +++$+++ 1980s
'Cause it's nicer than my place. +++$+++ 1990s
I'm here on behalf of the crew, sir. +++$+++ 1990s
No, miss. Smoking makes him spit and feel ill. +++$+++ 1960s
Al? +++$+++ 1980s
Fucking-a it's five clicks! At one point I had to cut through an ostrich farm. Fuckers are mean. +++$+++ 2000s
You're kidding. +++$+++ 1980s
Yeah.  I practically forgot.  But after you busted that thing, I got to thinking, "Jesus--maybe I'll start the violin again." That didn't just belong to Woodly.  That belonged to everybody.  Maybe he would have sold it to me, and I could have some fun.  After you busted the violin, boy, and Penelope walked out, I thought to myself, "Jesus--who could blame her?" +++$+++ 1970s
Honey, this tie has a spot on it, I can't wear this today. I got a 10:30 with Chuck. +++$+++ 1980s
Stairway, youíre wrapped, go to transport. +++$+++ 1990s
I feel really good. +++$+++ 1970s
Ahhh...A little high on the left, don't you think? +++$+++ 1980s
Well, I'm a little muddled.  The Munchkins called me because a new witch has just dropped a house on the Wicked Witch of the East.  And there's the house, and here you are, and that's all... +++$+++ 1930s
Ten minutes... +++$+++ 2000s
We'll be all right...  We will... +++$+++ 1970s
Aach! -- Oh, hi, Bo. +++$+++ 1990s
Darlin', you ain't seein' Santos again, are ya? +++$+++ 1990s
Look at that! +++$+++ 1990s
No, not really. They can't be bothered collecting half a cent from your paycheck anymore than you could. +++$+++ 1980s
Thanks, Sheriff. +++$+++ 1940s
I do. +++$+++ 1980s
Yeah? +++$+++ 1980s
I do have eighteen criminals under sentence of death, but I hold no prisoners-of-war. +++$+++ 2000s
This afternoon? +++$+++ 1990s
Aye, sir. +++$+++ 1990s
Both of these. +++$+++ 1990s
YOU KNIT? +++$+++ 1990s
We need scissors over here! Who's got scissors?  Okay, remember.  Jack and I go on first, I do the set-up, then introduce you. And you say ... +++$+++ 1980s
You know what I think? +++$+++ 1990s
I can't believe that we're eating Cantonese.  Is there no Szechuan up here?  Hunan? +++$+++ 1980s
You're not my brother.  The brother I knew would never have been caught by that dumb fuck Archer.  At least tell me the bomb is still going off. +++$+++ 1990s
Ahh. +++$+++ 1980s
Thanks, sister. How are ya. +++$+++ 2000s
I didn't see nothing. +++$+++ 2000s
Only in some ways. You're prettier... +++$+++ 1950s
I always thought there was something wrong with him. Heh heh heh. +++$+++ 1990s
Oh, yeah. I'm just curious about that kind of stuff. +++$+++ 2000s
Yes, sir. +++$+++ 1930s
NO, seriously - I know he's your boyfriend, but there's something about his upper lip that is so weird.  What do you think it is, Dad?  Jen says it's a moustache, I say it's a cluster of about 11 mosquitoes, resting. +++$+++ 1990s
No. This works better. With you gone and I don't have the money, he can't touch me. But I can sure touch him. After I find him I'll come and join you. +++$+++ 2000s
You don't. +++$+++ 1990s
I don't know what you mean. +++$+++ 2000s
But you didn't even taste your cocoa. +++$+++ 1990s
Whoopee. +++$+++ 2000s
Hey, go easy, Tatum. He didn't do it. +++$+++ 1990s
Shit.  It's my Galiano. +++$+++ 2000s
Hurry! She's lost it! +++$+++ 2000s
Oh fine, fi. Keeping out of trouble, you know. +++$+++ 1970s
Brought what on myself?! I didn’t do anything! +++$+++ 2000s
I know one thing he said.  It was when... when he took himself out and was standing up.  He said, "Don't worry, I didn't come." I can't forget that.  He said, "No little girl can ever make me come." +++$+++ 1990s
I'm waiting till the time's right. +++$+++ 2000s
What is? +++$+++ 1980s
That is bullshit! Mine is a bitch and yours is a psycho. I can't believe you're saying this, Marylin! There's nothing wrong with us. We're attractive and charismatic and successful and... I like us. +++$+++ 2000s
I watched her eat the watermelon. And all this juice started running down her chin and onto her shirt. +++$+++ 1990s
This is fuckin' post-pubescent Disneyland. +++$+++ 1990s
What do I care about Arthur! Did you see this stuff in the paper? How'd it get in there? What'd you do last night? Who were you talking to? +++$+++ 1930s
Obviously. +++$+++ 1990s
You booger. +++$+++ 1980s
I've always respected Bree.  I'd like to make something clear. +++$+++ 1970s
I can't handle this tonight. I'm going home. +++$+++ 1990s
What do you mean?  I checked them myself.  I made the calls... +++$+++ 1990s
Where else, but in a cage, does man belong? +++$+++ 2000s
Fourth measure, second beat - F.  Flam-mis a-cri-bus ad-dic-tis, flam- mis a-cri-bus ad-dic-tis. +++$+++ 1980s
X22. Read. +++$+++ 1990s
If this war is about more than Thomas, it's about more than Anne, as well.  Stay the course. +++$+++ 2000s
But I think it's time we stopped talking about me. A woman like you -- why haven't you ever married? +++$+++ 1980s
I'm not. No. But do you think we could liven it up with a few words now and then? +++$+++ 1960s
Who you calling? +++$+++ 1980s
He's handicapped, huh? +++$+++ 1990s
What? +++$+++ 1970s
After the revolution, the Paris cemeteries overflowed. They dug up all the old bodies and brought them here. Seven million people. Mostly very poor. +++$+++ 1990s
What was he in jail for? +++$+++ 1940s
Great.  Gotta go.  See you then. +++$+++ 2000s
I guess maybe I won't write that book after all. +++$+++ 1930s
This stuff's deadly -- I hope we know what we're doing. +++$+++ 1970s
Why haven't you been able to contact him? He should have returned from the neutron galaxy ages ago. He may be dead. ZOR-EL But what can you, a mere girl- +++$+++ 1980s
Well? +++$+++ 1990s
Very well. If Zira and Cornelius can prove that those scrolls don't tell the whole truth of your history; if they can show you definite evidence of another culture from an unrecorded past -- will you exonerate them? +++$+++ 2000s
Not getting an answer?  For Christ's sake!  Call 911!  Let's get it locked down here! +++$+++ 1990s
People were gettin' bloody noses - - things on your head - - aneurisms - - +++$+++ 1990s
I'll tell ya though, it's comin' up to the time when Marietta and me might just set up house together and settle down... I think that time's comin' up right soon. But like you said, everythin's relative. +++$+++ 1990s
Just five dollars, please. +++$+++ 2000s
Maybe. She's OK. +++$+++ 2000s
Now could you leave me alone? +++$+++ 1990s
We don't have to do this. I'm a daytrader. I could just go home. +++$+++ 2000s
I don't think you understand.    I won't wait. +++$+++ 2000s
It doesn't ring a bell.  I have to go. +++$+++ 1990s
Nurse! +++$+++ 1980s
Sissy Clark, 190 Riverside Dr., apartment 3C.  Tomorrow.  She's a nursing student.  Paying her way as a cocktail waitress at the Peppermint Lounge, on west 63rd.  Left work at two A M...killed in her apartment, between two thirty and five. +++$+++ 2000s
I'm sorry to say I know what you're saying. +++$+++ 1990s
Merle, hey Merle, you got any socks? +++$+++ 1970s
Where's Shane? +++$+++ 1990s
He black alright, he just ain't blue. +++$+++ 2000s
There, what's that place? +++$+++ 1990s
Yeah. +++$+++ 2000s
Gosh, no. Lipstick? What next? Mascara, blush, floral-print dresses? +++$+++ 2000s
I'm moving. Remember? What's with the hooded cloak? +++$+++ 1990s
I just fired Bob Alexander. +++$+++ 1990s
Julia's my second wife. +++$+++ 1980s
I can only write on a manual. +++$+++ 2000s
I can whip your ass. +++$+++ 1990s
How do you know? +++$+++ 1990s
I have an appointment this after- noon.  I need someone to take them to the park. +++$+++ 1990s
I see. +++$+++ 1990s
She's so big somebody could come alongside her on the other side and we'd never know it. +++$+++ 2000s
I said, do you want some water? +++$+++ 1990s
Let him go, he said. Let him go. +++$+++ 1990s
At-at-at-at-at. +++$+++ 1990s
--no way-- +++$+++ 1970s
It's simple.  What was your pal Louis' first musical instrument? +++$+++ 2000s
It's a long story.  Right now we gotta do somethin'. +++$+++ 2000s
You kept her in this filth in restraints...?. +++$+++ 1990s
How do you do, Skye? +++$+++ 2000s
That doesn't bother you, does it? +++$+++ 1990s
This Zen master surfer. +++$+++ 1990s
You stumbled into my hiding place. +++$+++ 1990s
It's not so bad. I know the night janitor. And there's a broken locker I can put my stuff. +++$+++ 2000s
What about Captain Amazing? +++$+++ 1990s
He keeps on acting like such an asshole! +++$+++ 2000s
Davis. I'm not one to bad-mouth anyone, your joke was amusing. But come on, man, you had one fatal flaw: Bateman's such a dork, such a boring, spineless lightweight, that I couldn't fully appreciate it. I wasn't fooled for a second. Now, if you'd said Price, or McDermott...Otherwise, it was amusing. Now, let's have lunch or dinner or something. Hilarious, Davis. A killer. +++$+++ 2000s
...and I'm going to get bounced and you're... +++$+++ 1990s
Right, I guess those are the kids -- +++$+++ 2000s
I've noticed it, too. I'll cough up the money, Ellen. +++$+++ 1980s
Problem? - No problem - yes, everything's going fantastically well, wonderful, marvelous, great career prospects, Alison in great shape, kids fine, beautiful home, I'm on Security Level Five now, and Mr Helpmann relies on me more and more, yes, couldn't be better, I feel terrifically motivated and job- rewarded - +++$+++ 1980s
Excuse me? +++$+++ 2000s
Because she doesn't know what a hint is. +++$+++ 2000s
Who won? How did it end? +++$+++ 1980s
Yeah. +++$+++ 1990s
He is speaking about a baggage we never even meet! What will be left in your purse when he meets his Juliet? +++$+++ 1990s
Just a little something of my own. +++$+++ 1940s
No, no, no! I disagree with you absolutely. That's the trouble with you artillery men. +++$+++ 1930s
What's he doing here? +++$+++ 1990s
How? +++$+++ 1990s
Seein' he loved the experience so much, I think we outta give him the pleasure again. +++$+++ 1990s
Waiting -- I'm waiting for news from Manchester. +++$+++ 1930s
I have to go now. I'm sorry. +++$+++ 1960s
They ran out of names a long time ago in this part of the galaxy. +++$+++ 1990s
What'd you say? +++$+++ 1990s
Yeah, but you fangs can see in the dark. What am I supposed to do? +++$+++ 2000s
And the good news is you won't charge me. +++$+++ 1990s
Micheal? Do you have something to tell me? +++$+++ 1990s
Gee. +++$+++ 1970s
What? +++$+++ 1990s
Hey, Ben. Thanks for coming down. +++$+++ 1990s
This puts me in a peculiar hole. +++$+++ 1940s
Vacuum-sealed globe ... shouldn't take long. +++$+++ 1990s
Come on, Esperanza -- how about it? We got to. +++$+++ 1950s
I doubt it. +++$+++ 1960s
Very well. I shall drop you and go on to the party. I have no intention of missing it... +++$+++ 1950s
We're getting married. She said she could tell I was a great artist – she could see it in my eyes. She said she wanted to be by my side and have inter-racial babies with me. +++$+++ 1990s
Any more, O -- ? +++$+++ 2000s
What are we gonna do? +++$+++ 1990s
How long you been lying there playing possum with us, huh? Answer me! +++$+++ 1990s
Yes, sir. +++$+++ 1940s
Never touched me. +++$+++ 1990s
Tom, you're the Consigliere, what do we do if the old man dies? +++$+++ 1970s
Michael, I don't have time. Please!  It's time you dealt with this and got over it.  Now come on! +++$+++ 1980s
I'm hardly doing a thing.  The less I think of it the better.  My parents are arranging everything. The Gous are a very powerful family. My marrying one will be good for my father's career. +++$+++ 2000s
-- all we know?  We don't know shit, Powell.  If there's hostages why hasn't anyone asked for ransom?  If there's terrorists, where's their goddamn list of demands?  All we know is that someone shot up your car, and it could be the same flake you've been talking to on the radio! +++$+++ 1980s
Hold on... I know I have it... +++$+++ 2000s
If he can do it, yes. +++$+++ 1930s
Hello? +++$+++ 1990s
Well, actually, we've never met officially, but I bumped into you at the cafeteria and you were so sweet. I said, "I'm sorry," and you said, "Watch it, white bitch, or I'll put my size eight in your ass." I thought how cool. I wear a size eight, too. Anyway, this is my best friend, Cindy. +++$+++ 2000s
Wh-- She's never said anything, and we're very close.  She'd tell me such a thing. +++$+++ 1980s
I've got a feelin' today. +++$+++ 1990s
We'll talk about it later.  Right now, you gotta get changed. +++$+++ 1980s
Well, one was for salad... +++$+++ 1990s
[Not this way. Call it a little favor, call it a little thing I'm going to do for you. I'm going to make Chicago come alive for you. You'll owe me one.] +++$+++ 2000s
All this for laying traps on private land? +++$+++ 1990s
I need to see you, Ballard. I need to talk to you about the project. +++$+++ 2000s
Serves you right. Oughta be careful who you take up with on the road. You can't go plyin' your trade in my camp. +++$+++ 1930s
... He killed Win... he enjoyed it... +++$+++ 1980s
I suppose he was trying to make me feel bad. +++$+++ 1940s
What? +++$+++ 2000s
Like the saber-toothed tiger. +++$+++ 1970s
Don't feel like nothing. +++$+++ 1990s
Listen, Father! "Young Lochinvar smitten with Susan Paine"! +++$+++ 1930s
Satch, would you listen to me here.  Just you and me.  Can I talk to you here, alone? +++$+++ 2000s
They called, they're going to settle, what I want to do is build up as much ... +++$+++ 1970s
Now let's keep going here. +++$+++ 1960s
Thanks for the offer, Adrian.  I'll let you know. +++$+++ 2000s
Forget it, Carmen. The Mobile Infantery does a thankless, dirty job, so they naturally tend to be short-tempered, thoughtless and rude. +++$+++ 1990s
Thanks. I made them by hand. +++$+++ 2000s
Do you still...see each other? +++$+++ 1980s
So -- maybe I'm old enough to tell you how to run your life? +++$+++ 1940s
Who we are. Don't you think they're going to be PISSED? +++$+++ 1990s
Because of your phone calls. +++$+++ 1990s
Evening. Table for one? +++$+++ 1990s
Is Sunshine your real name? +++$+++ 1970s
Oh, oh.  That sounds personal. +++$+++ 1990s
They have found a way to penetrate our shields. +++$+++ 1990s
Their next target.  The name is Neo. +++$+++ 1990s
I'm not gonna break it, I just wanna see it change colors. +++$+++ 1990s
I will meet you, but only one way -- if Robert the Bruce is there, and puts his hand on my Bible, and swears his loyalty to Scotland. +++$+++ 1990s
So what did you say to my parents on the phone? +++$+++ 2000s
You're kinda the best thing that's happened to me in a long time. +++$+++ 1990s
I don't know what's keeping me.  I should've been here a long time ago. Now how about my proposition? +++$+++ 1930s
Oz, it's okay, I know. +++$+++ 1990s
Yeah... I know what you mean. +++$+++ 1990s
My Diary's in Berlin. +++$+++ 1980s
His death was -- yes, he died as he lived. +++$+++ 1970s
We must talk. +++$+++ 1980s
Is your back still killing you? +++$+++ 2000s
Jeffrey. +++$+++ 1980s
Believe it. +++$+++ 1980s
So many people - know me. I wish I did. I wish someone would tell be about me... +++$+++ 1950s
With your gun?... +++$+++ 1980s
I may run out of money, but you have already run out of bread. Two years is a long time for your comrades to wait. +++$+++ 1930s
-- Me? Neither. +++$+++ 1980s
How much? +++$+++ 1990s
To the stars. +++$+++ 1990s
Ssshhhhh! +++$+++ 1980s
Don't be ridiculous! They're just a bunch of harmless old men. My grandfather was in there. +++$+++ 1980s
That's just a dream, William! +++$+++ 1990s
This is crazy. I come home, you go to your room. You go in the kitchen, I go to my room. It's stupid. +++$+++ 2000s
I know better than you what people will say when they have to.  When they brought me in for questioning I informed on my friends the very first day. +++$+++ 1990s
She's gone! +++$+++ 1990s
Well, you're pretty close. It's only about two miles from here. +++$+++ 1990s
Well, I'm running out of trees, so look me in the eye like a man and tell me you don't know!  Convince me! +++$+++ 2000s
Caught my first tube this morning. +++$+++ 1990s
Yeah, French guys from France. +++$+++ 2000s
We really must go, Mr. President. +++$+++ 1990s
He paid you man. +++$+++ 1990s
Eh, what's all this? +++$+++ 1960s
It must've been a time.  A golden moment. +++$+++ 1990s
Yes. +++$+++ 1990s
I’ve scheduled a medical for you. +++$+++ 1990s
Well, I feel I owe you something for all this... +++$+++ 1950s
I think it should be outlawed. +++$+++ 1990s
Well, that's all that wrestling is. Except usually there's more grunting and squirming before the pin. Well, it's your first time. And you're out of your weight class. +++$+++ 1990s
I don't love him. I love Ronald. +++$+++ 1990s
Just let me rest for a second. +++$+++ 1990s
There must be some connection between the plane and this place. They must have deliberately brought us here. Why, Bob? What reason could they have for doing a thing like that? +++$+++ 1930s
How can I help but mind? I'm constantly humiliated...  just because I haven't money. +++$+++ 1930s
"You Send Me." +++$+++ 1990s
What is that, some kind of Chinese proverb? +++$+++ 1990s
Your call is come through. +++$+++ 1980s
What about it? Wouldn't you agree that a great deal of mischief has been done in the name of love? +++$+++ 1970s
Don't make me tell you, Jason. +++$+++ 1940s
What you are talking about is a gamble on moderation -- when I gamble, I prefer to gamble on force. +++$+++ 1990s
...to him. +++$+++ 1990s
Everyday I have my friend Rick here bring a newly-cut red rose in with him and keep it behind the bar.  And I award it to a woman of exceptional beauty. +++$+++ 1990s
You think I'm the WHITE ANGEL? +++$+++ 1990s
They don't have a murder weapon? +++$+++ 2000s
I don't know. Salmon. Don't you always have white wine with fish? +++$+++ 2000s
I don't have time for all this shit!  Just handle it, Bob!  Keep it out of the White House.  What else? Kissinger's waiting -- he's gonna throw a tantrum again if I don't see him, threatening to quit ... again. +++$+++ 1990s
Yeah.  Right. +++$+++ 1980s
Take a whiff of heaven. +++$+++ 2000s
Look, Lieutenant. All your dough won't help you here. Because here you're on your own. And no mother to throw you a lifebelt. Now let's see how good you can swim. +++$+++ 1950s
Uh, Amber? We're not puttin' on our Talent costumes. You need to put on your "Physical Fitness" outfit. And let's shake a leg, ladies. +++$+++ 1990s
Dad, this is what I really wanted to ask you.... +++$+++ 1930s
Injected Windex!  Why would he switch to a new m.o.? +++$+++ 1990s
Did you see anything in the files? +++$+++ 2000s
Ah -- that's where reason took hold. +++$+++ 1940s
Yes, Mr. Preysing -- that's what we want to know. +++$+++ 1930s
Not English. +++$+++ 1990s
No what? +++$+++ 1990s
Thank you for coming.  Would you care for a drink? +++$+++ 1990s
No, I'm serious...You're really good. +++$+++ 1980s
I know. I'm Andy McDermott. Terrence's nephew. +++$+++ 1990s
Well. What do you want to do? You want to steal one or just drive your car? +++$+++ 1990s
What the hell are you talking about? +++$+++ 1990s
Who's controlling your mind? +++$+++ 1990s
But there's one thing. The desk clerk seemed to be a little bit suspicious. I mean -- I don't know what their policy is -- but -- +++$+++ 1960s
How could they get by him? +++$+++ 1990s
Yes? +++$+++ 1990s
Let's have lunch! +++$+++ 1990s
What's up? Jess ready? +++$+++ 2000s
I haven't seen her in months. +++$+++ 1990s
Don't want weak legs. +++$+++ 1970s
Then? +++$+++ 1990s
You're kidding me. +++$+++ 2000s
You've been talking to her on the phone for weeks! +++$+++ 1990s
Come, come. You don't really expect me to fall for -- +++$+++ 1990s
Louder, girl! +++$+++ 1990s
Oh no! Tell her she's got to go back... +++$+++ 1950s
Walter. +++$+++ 1990s
So I said to myself, "All right, if he wants to look at them, let him look at them. No harm in that." And then he said, "Say ah." And then I said, "Ah." And that's all I remember ... And when I woke up, I still had my tonsils, but my pocketbook was gone. +++$+++ 1930s
Your Majesty -- some men are content to read about things.  I must see them with my own eyes.  I cannot be other than I am. +++$+++ 1990s
Okay?  I just blew up.  I feel orgasmic. +++$+++ 1990s
You're marrying again. +++$+++ 2000s
Does this violate the patient/doctor relationship? +++$+++ 1990s
And a *lot* of paper! +++$+++ 1930s
You know about animals -- their habits -- will it come back? +++$+++ 1940s
You won't shoot me.  That's not your style. +++$+++ 2000s
Funny -- you look married. +++$+++ 1990s
Doug sees beyond that stuff to what the person inside is like. That's why I'm marrying him. +++$+++ 1980s
He only had a hundred an' thirty. -- I think he's good for the rest next week, Mr. Gazzo. +++$+++ 1970s
Wait. How about this? +++$+++ 1990s
Come on. Let's go. +++$+++ 2000s
Can I ask you where you were the night Teresa Banks was murdered? +++$+++ 1990s
I ain't gonna leave a seven- hundred-dollar Remington behind. +++$+++ 1990s
You're not gonna tell Mom, are you? +++$+++ 2000s
Came  on back.  Let me show you where it fits in. +++$+++ 1950s
So was I. So don't give me any shit. Your business is just as bad. At least I'm up front about it. You kill people slowly. Your corporate take overs can decimate a families livelihood over a year sometimes two. Now you know how it feels. +++$+++ 2000s
It'll be very interesting to see how you go about solving this, Inspector-- +++$+++ 1930s
Of course.  Minister Johnstone. +++$+++ 1990s
Easy Sketchy. +++$+++ 1990s
A free thinker. +++$+++ 1980s
Well, I - +++$+++ 1990s
What're you askin' me for -- put 'em in the first helicopter comes in tomorrow. +++$+++ 1970s
You couldn't? +++$+++ 1990s
Am I artifact or dream?  You might ask that about anything. +++$+++ 1990s
Can't you just quit?  Walk away? +++$+++ 2000s
Thirty-seven! +++$+++ 1990s
But my neck hurts... and I have a slight cough... +++$+++ 1990s
...four years ago... +++$+++ 1970s
That <u>is</u> the plan...I mean, goddamn it!  What the hell are those things?  How could they bury an entire Plymouth station wagon? +++$+++ 1990s
I know. It won't go unnoticed. +++$+++ 2000s
Please prepare carefully.  This couldn't come at a better time. +++$+++ 1980s
Making it with my mother? +++$+++ 1970s
And they'll go out the minute there's another ray.  A cylinder reported down by Huntington Beach.  That's a job for the Navy. +++$+++ 1950s
Jordan.  I always hoped we'd get together -- though just now I'm gearing up for a child-care vote that -- +++$+++ 1990s
It was made clear.  Anyway, stay ballsy.  First week's hell, then it levels out.  Until S.E.R.E. training, anyway.  That's hell-and-a-half. +++$+++ 1990s
You mean -- +++$+++ 2000s
You haven't paid the cab.  He won't give us your bags 'til you pay him. +++$+++ 1990s
How did you know I was here? +++$+++ 1990s
Just gimme the damn remote! +++$+++ 1990s
Some other time, George. +++$+++ 1940s
He says things.  Bad things. +++$+++ 1990s
Alright, let's check it out. +++$+++ 2000s
Why, do you think? +++$+++ 1990s
But I have my clothes on! +++$+++ 1990s
What you have to get personal about so quick? All I mean is you could possibly read a book. +++$+++ 1990s
I don't care, Philip.  You want to go chasing Barbara Zelman, go ahead.  Just watch out for those buck teeth. +++$+++ 1980s
What? +++$+++ 1980s
A decent life?  Excuse me?  As what?  A janitor? +++$+++ 1990s
Well, it looks like we'll be getting our new school. +++$+++ 1960s
One time he was doing a rekkie of the Libyan coastline.  This is, like, right before we bombed Khadaffi into the past tense.  So his crew does a nighttime infil, maps all the big artillery placements and stuff, then turns around to get the hell gone.  But between them and the water are five Libyan guards, all armed to the nuts. +++$+++ 1990s
We have to launch his ship by tomorrow afternoon. +++$+++ 1990s
Benjamin -- I want you to know I'm available to you. If you won't sleep with me this time -- +++$+++ 1960s
Are there any other shuttles? +++$+++ 2000s
Right... +++$+++ 1980s
That's marriage. +++$+++ 2000s
We can't leave him! +++$+++ 1990s
Is it coming from our own computer? +++$+++ 1990s
And what do we get out of it? +++$+++ 1980s
Wing attack, Plan-R.  That's exactly what it says. +++$+++ 1960s
Are you screwy? +++$+++ 1930s
Why? +++$+++ 2000s
I still don't understand why you keep her around. +++$+++ 1990s
That depends on the tip. +++$+++ 1930s
You must be going somewhere. +++$+++ 2000s
Sure you are.  You're just a happier woman, cause you don't have to deal with maxi-pads and underwire. +++$+++ 2000s
But yours is the one who's going to subpoena me, Sam.  Force me to testify in court.  He came by the garage this afternoon.  Gave me this piece of paper. +++$+++ 1990s
Nice jugs. +++$+++ 2000s
D.C., Chief. +++$+++ 1990s
Yeah? +++$+++ 1990s
Do you think I'm strange? +++$+++ 2000s
Come in, Mr. Juarez. I'd stand, but, well, you know. +++$+++ 1990s
You don't like me? +++$+++ 2000s
I was, too. +++$+++ 1960s
So avoid using the word 'very' because it's lazy.  A man is not very tired, he is exhausted.  Don't use very sad, use morose.  Language was invented for one reason, boys--to woo women--and, in that endeavor, laziness will not do.  It also won't do in your essays. +++$+++ 1980s
I think it may help us but there’s a slight chance it could make things worse. +++$+++ 2000s
That is correct, Major. +++$+++ 1960s
Had a lot of blood in him. +++$+++ 2000s
Oh, I'll call you up some time. And if your social duties permit - why - +++$+++ 1930s
Close up shop! +++$+++ 1990s
Tomorrow morning, before the store opening. +++$+++ 1990s
Just checking, young sir. +++$+++ 1990s
All right, so I made another deal. +++$+++ 1990s
It's not the gas, Dad! +++$+++ 1980s
...No. +++$+++ 1990s
I don't like what he does. +++$+++ 1980s
The idea of going after guys like you appealed to me. +++$+++ 1990s
Yup.  Thanks for the ride.  You all take care. +++$+++ 1990s
Doctor King is my favorite. +++$+++ 1990s
You'll know soon enough. +++$+++ 2000s
Lip reading. +++$+++ 1960s
You want to "profile" me? Find out what makes me "tick"? Write about me, go on a talk show, give me a nickname? +++$+++ 2000s
A lovely piece of theater. Small but important. +++$+++ 2000s
I know what's eatin' you, kid. But I got two thousand dues-payin' members in my local— that's seventy-two thousand a year legitimate and when each one of 'em puts in a couple of bucks a day to make sure they work steady— well, you figure it out. And that's just for openers. We got the fattest piers in the fattest harbor in the world. Everything that moves in and out— we take our cut. +++$+++ 1950s
Oh, just like in the script! +++$+++ 1990s
I shoulda saved him 'cause he <u>believed</u> you? +++$+++ 2000s
Ya-hoo, let's'play ball! +++$+++ 1970s
What would you like, beer? +++$+++ 2000s
I'm real sorry.  My stockbroker must have transferred the wrong account... C'mon in, I'll write you another one. +++$+++ 1990s
You're lawyers.  How can you let this shit go by!  Look!  This?  Nixon can't say this. +++$+++ 1990s
Here, boy! +++$+++ 1930s
Lester, this is my friend Jill and this is Johnny Pope. +++$+++ 1970s
I think you'd better sit down. +++$+++ 1990s
Well, it wasn't a reduction like you do it!  Boiling down half a ton of bones... +++$+++ 1990s
I'm going to go powder my nose. +++$+++ 1990s
His head.  Someone cut it off. +++$+++ 1990s
ON CAIN, AS SHE LOOKS AROUND. +++$+++ 1990s
I know. +++$+++ 2000s
Kill myself. +++$+++ 1980s
It won't take but a minute. It's a votive offering for a lady who was cured just when she was dying of fever. Our Lady of the Helpless granted her a favor. +++$+++ 1960s
Intestines. +++$+++ 1990s
Shut the door, Lester. What do you think this is, a picnic? +++$+++ 1970s
They both have some growing up to do.  But they're good people, they're starting with love. They've got time. +++$+++ 1990s
Out my way in Montana we always call a bluff. +++$+++ 1930s
You're hung up again. +++$+++ 1990s
That-a-boy. Hospital. +++$+++ 1980s
James Looks Twice? +++$+++ 1990s
What did you do with her? +++$+++ 1940s
Louis the Sixteenth wore a fabulous stone, called the Blue Diamond of the Crown, which disappeared in 1792, about the time Louis lost everything from the neck up. The theory goes that the crown diamond was chopped too... recut into a heart-like shape... and it became Le Coeur de la Mer. The Heart of the Ocean. Today it would be worth more than the Hope Diamond. +++$+++ 1990s
Cuz once in a while soil need a change. Corn take up a lot of nitrate in the fertilizer. So next crop what ya do is plant ya some soy beans. That give off a lot of nitrate. Change keeps it all growin' and growin' strong.  Sting a bit? +++$+++ 2000s

Okay, Joe. +++$+++ 1950s
Fifty years. The rep is known around Philly, an' a good rep can't be bought, but I don't have to tell you that. +++$+++ 1970s
Here. I'll turn down the air conditioner. +++$+++ 1990s
Let's talk about the work that you care so much about. +++$+++ 2010s
I only exchanged a few casual words with her, as one would ordinarily do on a public bus... +++$+++ 1960s
Are these philosopher going to be here to help you fight your war? You know why I don't trust revolutions?  Because each of us is who we are:  we make speeches, print pamphlets, and we never change.  The world is not a philosophical abstraction, Mister Adams, it's us.  And, I don't believe you can ever change human nature. +++$+++ 2000s
I love you, Vanessa. +++$+++ 1990s
It means you don't talk to anybody. You don't draw attention to yourself in any way.  Do you understand that? +++$+++ 1990s
Yes how are you, Janet?  Are you happy? +++$+++ 1980s
You men remain seated! +++$+++ 1970s
There seems to be some confusion about your registration. I believe I can find you a place at the Ambassador. Many persons of the Jewish faith find it quite... +++$+++ 1990s
How old are you? +++$+++ 1980s
You watch that mouth. +++$+++ 1990s
I touched a nerve. +++$+++ 1990s
Good Lord, Freddie! What have you got in there? +++$+++ 1980s
I'm sorry. It just...It seems silly. Like kissing a girl. +++$+++ 2000s
The Aquarium was swell. If I lived in New York, I'd go there every day. I'll bet you do. +++$+++ 1930s

Don't go out of your way. +++$+++ 1990s
You did too. Sybok couldn't possibly be your brother because I happen to know for a fact that you don't have a brother. +++$+++ 1980s
It doesn't sound too bad. I'll try and stay awake. +++$+++ 1980s

How else was I going to get you here?  I haven't seen you in a week. +++$+++ 1980s
How did you come to have my address? Found it, did you.  Among her things. +++$+++ 1990s
His journals, letters, maps, books... +++$+++ 2000s
Where'd you go? +++$+++ 1990s
I could carve a better man out of a banana! +++$+++ 1970s
Everybody out, back to your tents, <u>now</u>! +++$+++ 1990s
Thanks. +++$+++ 1990s
That's what I mean... 'Night, Roy. +++$+++ 1990s
"Where the cup that holds the blood of Jesus Christ resides forever." +++$+++ 1980s
You're trying to save Sparazza? +++$+++ 2000s
Christ, it's Ho-Jon! +++$+++ 1970s
I'll have to find some more. +++$+++ 1980s
Look I-I-I'll be okay.  I'll be okay. +++$+++ 1980s
I don't thinkI can. +++$+++ 1990s
How 'you doin' man? +++$+++ 1960s
He's lost complete faith in me-- +++$+++ 1930s
Well... I mean... what am I supposed to say here, Bern?  Is this a riddle or what? +++$+++ 1990s
What went wrong?  Hang on, I think I know ... You kept things from her. +++$+++ 1990s
Fuck. Wade Whitehouse. It's people like you that keep this fucking town from prospering. Whatever somebody does to improve things around here, you gotta find fault with it. +++$+++ 1990s
Nonsense +++$+++ 1990s
I just stopped your heart for five seconds. It felt like an eternity, didn't it? Did you know that you can stop the human heart for up to ten minutes before the onset of brain damage? +++$+++ 1990s
Hi. +++$+++ 1970s
Great minds think alike. +++$+++ 1990s
So what makes you so special? +++$+++ 1990s
What time is it? +++$+++ 1990s
Maybe...? +++$+++ 1990s
Shhhh...don't tell no one.  Job security. +++$+++ 1980s
Did he say anything about me - tell me? +++$+++ 1940s
Oh my God. +++$+++ 1990s
It's impossible. +++$+++ 1990s
Instead you're going to bust your ass for five years so you can be broke? SKYLAR No, so I can be a doctor. +++$+++ 1990s
But why? +++$+++ 1980s
A yert.  Ruth is a living legend, Rex. At a time when most women are in Boca, having early bird specials -- she's working so her husband can be in Montana. In a yert. +++$+++ 2000s
If only I could find her. If only she could see me now, here, with such lovely kind friends. You, Mrs. Treves, and you, Mr. Treves. Then maybe she would love me as I am. I've tried to hard to be good. +++$+++ 1980s
Seeing you were her sole benefactor, and I'm the executive of the will, Kirsty's entire estate would have to be donated to the city. +++$+++ 2000s
It's happened before, you know! Some of the world's happiest marriage have started 'under the gun' you might say. +++$+++ 1950s
Well, Normie - you won't have to worry about this one being finished for a lonnnnng time.  How are the hands...? +++$+++ 1990s
Listen, I don't need any encouragement, but my idea of heaven is a solid white night club, with me as the head liner, for all eternity and they love me. +++$+++ 1970s
Dad, you and I have talked about this.  Lloyd and I have talked about this.  Believe me, this is well-covered territory. +++$+++ 1980s
I'm on Sunset. Near the Beverly Hills hotel. Wanna meet me for a drink in the Polo...? +++$+++ 2000s
Bimboo? +++$+++ 2000s
Well, honey, doctors are sadists who like to play God and watch lesser people scream. +++$+++ 2000s
Come here, son... +++$+++ 1970s
I can appeal in five. I was hoping you could help me Mr. Fazeli. +++$+++ 1990s
What are you doing? +++$+++ 1990s
I gave him yours.  Said, here, you want to write, I think this is a relative.  I guess I thought I was being true to Jenny.  Who told me she didn't have a father -- before proceeding of course to tell me why. +++$+++ 1990s
But I don't play anything. +++$+++ 1970s
All he can. All he can. +++$+++ 1990s
Man, I must really be stoned.  Thanks, buddy. +++$+++ 2000s
We trust you, Lloyd.  You know that. +++$+++ 1980s
Hurry -- hurry -- +++$+++ 1930s
I know. +++$+++ 2000s
So, what? The thing with the glass? Price did that? +++$+++ 1990s
If they catch you here, we'll both be in big trouble. +++$+++ 1980s
That, that was <u>business</u>... +++$+++ 2000s
...Count it if you want. +++$+++ 1980s
Denying? +++$+++ 1990s
Be careful. +++$+++ 1980s
No. I didn't know that. +++$+++ 2000s
You were there when I last saw him. +++$+++ 1990s
Shut up, will you? +++$+++ 1990s
If the Mario brothers weren't Jersey's third largest family, I'd say kiss my ass.  But considering your status, I'll say slurp my butt. +++$+++ 1990s
Well, I just want to know the procedure. I don't want to upset your routine. Do you want any jam? +++$+++ 1990s
'Cause you're gonna get me a disguise. +++$+++ 2000s
That wasn't my fault. +++$+++ 2000s
That is how V'ger will survive. +++$+++ 1970s
Well, I certainly would have heard about that. +++$+++ 2000s
Okay... +++$+++ 1920s
I believe you. Did that nice doctor let you out? Or is this you improvising again, Grady? +++$+++ 2000s
I'll be leaving now, Mrs. Stanwyk. +++$+++ 1980s
The men. Do any of them still live around here? +++$+++ 2000s
They're fine. My old man was a bus driver, mom a nurse--I was sort of born to it, I guess. +++$+++ 1990s
How could you possibly? +++$+++ 1990s
And where do you put these ghosts once you catch them? +++$+++ 1980s
I was doing my job. +++$+++ 1990s
Well, well, I'll have to put my thinking-cap on about all this. You'll leave the money as a deposit?  Very good. +++$+++ 1990s
Sit in this chair, and I'll pose you. +++$+++ 1950s
It'll be even shorter if I get that new job.  Come on. +++$+++ 1980s
Thelma, I'm going to Mexico.  I think I can make it in two and a half days, but I'm going to have to haul ass.  Are you up to this?  I mean, I have to know.  This isn't a game.  I'm in deep shit.  I gotta know what you're gonna do. +++$+++ 1990s
Come on, gimme some more details. How'd it happen? Some fuckin' drunk kill her? +++$+++ 1990s
Here it is.  A bird on one side. His cage on the other.  Now, stare at it.  The bird seems to be in his cage. +++$+++ 1990s
I find these wisecracks increasingly less funny! 'Aged in Wood' happens to be a fine and distinguished play- +++$+++ 1950s
They murdered my soldiers. Ten Belgians who I sent to get the lady minister. +++$+++ 2000s
And these are my associates, the Shoveler. +++$+++ 1990s
Neither do I. +++$+++ 2000s
Supposing she's an assassin? +++$+++ 2000s
I'm telling you what I have to do. What you have to do, in case you forgot, is come up with premium of a thousand bucks. +++$+++ 1990s
Explain what? How you were waiting until the time was right, and then you were going to dump me for her? +++$+++ 1990s
Coffee, Ed? +++$+++ 2000s
Your brother was a good man. +++$+++ 1990s
Take it, man! You're all right! Hold it in! GUARD! +++$+++ 2000s
What makes you so sure? +++$+++ 1990s
He's got a gun!! +++$+++ 1980s
As for our plan of action, anybody'd be insane to go in from the ground floor... +++$+++ 1990s
Oh well, then I'll put some cookies at the top of the stairs for you gals. +++$+++ 2000s
Because they told us that we mustn't use weapons, now, when the time is right. +++$+++ 1960s
Enjoy it, sweetheart... +++$+++ 2000s
You propose to a woman you should offer her a ring of engagement. +++$+++ 1980s
You don't want to say hi to your father? +++$+++ 1990s
These people are contemptible. They have no sense of dignity at all. +++$+++ 1960s
At the point -- I don't -- Look you'd be on TV maybe one or two times each. I'11 try to avoid I'11 go out of my way to avoid, getting together with you. Believe me. +++$+++ 1990s
I won't. +++$+++ 1990s
Do what? +++$+++ 1990s
What's this? December 8th, 1958? +++$+++ 1990s
You'll get to see the file on this case. And there's another reason. +++$+++ 1980s
How are you doing? +++$+++ 1990s
You was just doing your job. +++$+++ 2000s
I promised to protect her from people like you. +++$+++ 1990s
Sweetheart, you can get a whole big bunch. +++$+++ 2000s
You see? Life can be so simple. +++$+++ 1930s
Yes, Betty? +++$+++ 1990s
This tie cost more than your entire wardrobe. +++$+++ 1990s
What? I... I wasn't saying... +++$+++ 2000s
No, no, no.  You don't need my truck. You need somebody else's truck... +++$+++ 1990s
What? +++$+++ 2000s
She did.  Bring her back.  Now.  For a talk. +++$+++ 1990s
Yeah, but not seriously. Christ, you're ready to walk down the aisle- I'd say that constitutes something more than just seeing somebody. +++$+++ 1990s
You said it like it was a big joke, Bob. Like he's wild. +++$+++ 1990s
Like what you're doing. I'm not going to eat you up.  I need your help, and if you keep staring at me like that. I might start screaming. +++$+++ 1990s
It's slander. It's reckless disregard. I'll sue you and your fucking Jew paper. +++$+++ 2000s
Because I got off to a wrong foot with my own thing, you know.  B-b- b-but I need a dramatic change in my life. FATHER  You're gonna believe in Jesus Christ? +++$+++ 1980s
I think what you did... +++$+++ 1990s
You coming up on him? +++$+++ 1970s
No. They would never do that. +++$+++ 1990s
You're serious?  You'd help me... +++$+++ 2000s
We weren't rich.  But we weren't poor either. +++$+++ 1990s
Jesus, look at you   You're glowing. +++$+++ 1990s
Vince D'Agosta.  Am I out? +++$+++ 1990s
Why not just use a scope and a poison dart and snipe him from a hill? +++$+++ 1990s
Oh goody, nothing like spinning my chair around to a techno mix of Hava Nagila til I puke. +++$+++ 2000s
No.    145 Ridgeroad Way. +++$+++ 2000s
You're not the quiet type, Frances. +++$+++ 1980s
Bring him over sometime. I have some other stuff to show him. +++$+++ 1990s
I wouldn't say that--  I'm glad he's dead--yes--I'd thought of killing him-- but I didn't-- +++$+++ 1930s
I'm calling it three. +++$+++ 2000s
Do we know anything about him? +++$+++ 1990s
What would it take? +++$+++ 1990s
We've created a monster. +++$+++ 2000s
No, see, sweetheart, you don't want to stand up for parasite 'cause I can fuckin' smell him from here. You know what? Tow words, man: roll on. +++$+++ 1990s
His mother had a cookout a few weeks ago. He could do a lot better if you ask me. +++$+++ 2000s
Jesus, what a day. Felt like I couldn't've sold ice water in the Sahara. Jesus. Okay, so you don't want insurance, so okay, that's your loss. But God, people can be rude. Feel like I have to talk to a normal person like just to restore a little of my... +++$+++ 1990s
Like a home, for one thing. +++$+++ 1960s
Keep it between us girls? +++$+++ 1990s
Not you. Them. +++$+++ 1980s
I just, I don't know... +++$+++ 1990s
Nurse! Nurse! +++$+++ 1980s
Well, yes your nose is. Very. +++$+++ 1960s
...twenty-five thousand? +++$+++ 1990s
I do.  And I practice with them. At least three hours a day. +++$+++ 2000s
I'd say about thirty feet, sir. +++$+++ 1980s
Here are some blankets.  This is a good song, this is a really good song. +++$+++ 1980s
But that's an hour's drive. +++$+++ 1990s
So what do you want with me, Jimmy? +++$+++ 1990s
You moved? +++$+++ 1990s
What are your rates? +++$+++ 1990s
We're doing something -- ? +++$+++ 2000s
Then we have to find a safe port around here.  Got any ideas? +++$+++ 1980s
As a representative of Moscow... +++$+++ 1930s
...have you come back? +++$+++ 1930s
I want you to know we're going to do everything, in our power to get you out as soon as possible. Believe me. +++$+++ 1970s
I'm sorry. +++$+++ 2000s
Give it to me. +++$+++ 1990s
Look, a lot's been going on.  That's what I wanted to tell you guys about. I need to tell you.  You see... a while ago, I met this guy -- +++$+++ 1990s
Oh, about ten days ago. +++$+++ 1980s
I took advantage of you and worst of all, I'm not alone. I did this with a kid.  I was just on some ride where I thought I was in 1ove enough for both of us.  I did this.  And at least I can do something about it now. +++$+++ 1990s
I like 'em small. When you're inside a little Asian chick, it's like your dick is the axle that holds her body together. +++$+++ 2000s
What do you do? +++$+++ 2000s
I've been calling you for five minutes! Didn't you hear me? +++$+++ 1980s
Please, Jam, we're trying to vent some hostility here. Sure the whole thing may be your fault, but who's gonna get pissed off at you? +++$+++ 1990s
Oh, thank you, Amy. +++$+++ 1940s
- - shut up. +++$+++ 1990s
Ricky?  Where...what... +++$+++ 1980s
Just walk over here quietly now-- and there won't be any trouble. +++$+++ 1950s
The kind that gets divorced, but still stay friends. +++$+++ 2000s
On it!  I'm in it ... They think I did it! +++$+++ 1930s
Stop picking on him. +++$+++ 1960s
Is this normal? +++$+++ 1990s
Do you want your buttons on the left or the right? +++$+++ 1990s
It's just... I leave behind friends, family, a coupla good job offers in Chicago and in three dizzying weeks I've helped acquit a coke dealer, a speed dealer -- +++$+++ 1980s
It's about time. +++$+++ 2000s
I love you. +++$+++ 2000s
I assume you are making those cartoon noises to attract my attention.  Am I correct in my assumption, you fish-faced enemy of the people? +++$+++ 1960s
I better get you home before you catch your death from pneumonia. +++$+++ 1990s
On the modern novel - you remember what we arranged and we want you to talk on the Crisis of Faith. +++$+++ 1940s
It's the site of their new museum and we're taking it over.  Operation Deflower Mayflower is going full speed ahead. +++$+++ 1990s
He will be waiting... +++$+++ 1940s
All right, suppose it wasn't Tom Grunemann; where does that get you? +++$+++ 1970s
We could hardly say no. +++$+++ 2000s
Yes, Major. +++$+++ 1960s
Now I'll pump it up...  ... and you just turn the handles.  Okay. What do you smell? +++$+++ 1970s
Yeah, RIGHT. +++$+++ 1990s
Here. Let me put these in some rubbing alcohol. +++$+++ 1990s
You sure you don't want a ride to work? +++$+++ 1980s
I’ll call again. +++$+++ 1990s
You're going to need special care for a long time to come.  It's not going to be easy.  Not for you, not for any of us.  Because we love you so much.  And it's going to cost money.  More than we can imagine. +++$+++ 1990s
The Son'a reports claim they didn't fire until after he malfunctioned. +++$+++ 1990s
No, it is. It's just one more thing to add to your "things that make you a better person than me" list. +++$+++ 1990s
This is fucking unbelievable.  Zuzu, it's a long story, you see... +++$+++ 1990s
Right! +++$+++ 1990s
Figures. +++$+++ 1980s
Stay in the car. I'll only take a second. +++$+++ 2000s
Alright, do what you want. But keep the screws on him. He's a wild card. That could be either good or bad. +++$+++ 2000s
Professor Tripp? +++$+++ 2000s
Compensate! +++$+++ 1990s
He has to look here or I won't get a clear shot.  Call him, Margo. +++$+++ 1990s
Even that could be a trick. You escape, then show up at the address which the brothers in prison gave to you, and so you are able to contact me ... +++$+++ 1960s
I don't think I could. +++$+++ 1990s
Friends call me Otis - sometimes Tricky Otis. +++$+++ 1950s
You're groping.  I have been fair. It's my move now. +++$+++ 1990s
I don't know -- the gym, the fights. I <i>know</i> he don't miss the fights.  Having some tomorrow night at the State Theater.  He use to take me. +++$+++ 1990s
I'm not a hire car.  It's against regs? +++$+++ 2000s
No. +++$+++ 1990s
Your prerogative, Senator. +++$+++ 1990s
I would have figured you an R.N. by now, or, maybe Med School. +++$+++ 2000s
Sounds like a two weeks' notice to me. +++$+++ 1930s
Was she the only one? +++$+++ 1990s
You know what a hostile gesture that is to me? +++$+++ 1970s
This is the shell.  What about the gun? +++$+++ 1990s
Yeah. +++$+++ 1990s
Yes. +++$+++ 2000s
Not anymore, not in the city. +++$+++ 1990s
It seemed like my life was slipping away, somehow. I was a knot in the middle of a wet rope. Everything was futile and nothing had value. +++$+++ 1990s
OK, cop. I want you to give yourself and your friends on the force a message. Tell them I've got my own reasons to be very interested in whomever did the job on the nuns. I'll double the Church reward if you bring those punks direct to me. 100 G cash. Get it? +++$+++ 1990s
I don't believe you had a mother. +++$+++ 1990s
It's not gonna take long, Sam. +++$+++ 1990s
A cup of tea would be nice.  Would it be alright if I sit down for a few minutes, Mrs. Otto?  I want to talk to you. +++$+++ 1990s
That staggering. His dying so quickly.  In your campaigns, have you never seen men who staggered before they died, who talked incoherently —— walked blindly. +++$+++ 1940s
It's going to be closer.  You better get going. +++$+++ 1980s
Stanford. I'm leaving in June after I graduate. +++$+++ 1990s
I can't hear him. +++$+++ 1970s
We don't have a choice Jen. We're stuck until he comes back. +++$+++ 1990s
Now you are being rude. +++$+++ 1990s
Neither do I. +++$+++ 1990s
Poor Madame Yakushova... here we are talking in mysteries.... I'm sure you wonder what it's all about. +++$+++ 1930s
No. No, they're white. He's got a nice dog. +++$+++ 1970s
Adrian -- you've lost it. +++$+++ 2000s
Take your time. Enjoy L.A. +++$+++ 1990s
She should be shortly. +++$+++ 1990s
Millions, Stephen -- And sexual favors. +++$+++ 1990s
I wanted you here so we could have a few months together.  Maybe everything happens for a reason.  Something bad to force something good. +++$+++ 2000s
Well, where? +++$+++ 1990s
Take the Getty Center exit -- make a right onto Cisco.  It'll be a narrow winding road.  You can't miss the house.  It's a mansion built back in '29 -- Spanish -- boarded up since the quake. +++$+++ 2000s
If he's one of those Things, we've got to get to him before he changes... Nauls, you and Childs and I'll check the outside shacks... +++$+++ 1980s
Hi.  Listen.  Could I steal you a second? +++$+++ 1990s
The EPA?  What's he want? +++$+++ 1980s
Five bucks! You mean you're going to charge me five bucks just to look at it? +++$+++ 1990s
I thought, geez, is that Margie Olmstead? I can't believe it! +++$+++ 1990s
But Irena is in the garden. She's right there, under the tree. +++$+++ 1940s
I'm really beat.  I need some serious "z's"-- +++$+++ 1980s
Have you been hurt? +++$+++ 2000s
This is where I get off. +++$+++ 1950s
That was to get him to talk!  Get rid of that thing, will you? +++$+++ 2000s
Wow you are out of it. +++$+++ 2000s
Yes.. +++$+++ 1990s
I'd rather take my chances with them... than with Francis. +++$+++ 1970s
I've been investigating sightings for seventeen years, Mr. Shermin. This one's real. We have a dead extra- terrestrial in that tent and another one in the area that might be alive. We've been visited. It's finally happened and the sooner Washington accepts that and starts figuring out how we're going to deal with these beings, the better off we're going to be. +++$+++ 1980s
You must have some idea about him. +++$+++ 1990s
I don't understand.  Aren't you frightened? +++$+++ 1980s
What? +++$+++ 1990s
But Mose Harper said... +++$+++ 1950s
How's it going? It's been a while... +++$+++ 1990s
Yes. +++$+++ 1990s
Hi. +++$+++ 2000s
I apologized, I offered to help. +++$+++ 1990s
What about the Cromwells? +++$+++ 1980s
Malcolm, they keep calling, threatening us. I'm going crazy, when is this going to stop? +++$+++ 1990s
It's obvious that the girl doesn't want to accompany you, isn't it? +++$+++ 1980s
I know. And that's great. But it would be great in a better way, not a better way but a different way, if I could find him and bring him back. +++$+++ 2000s
Yes, they don't like hearing it and find it difficult to say.  Whereas without batting an eye a man will refer to his "dick" or his "rod" or his "Johnson". +++$+++ 1990s
Put your arms around me. +++$+++ 2000s
I do.  I take it all very personally.  Very nice meeting you, Vivian. +++$+++ 1990s
The door's locked. I'll gotta go around... wait here. +++$+++ 2000s
Einstein, right?  We'll see ya. +++$+++ 2000s
What is that? +++$+++ 1990s
Get me a typewriter.  I'll finish the notice. +++$+++ 1940s
What's the fucking point in any case...?  What's the point.  I got to argue with you, I got to knock heads with the cops, I'm busting my balls, sell you dirt to fucking deadbeats money in the mattress, I come back you can't even manage to keep the contracts safe, I have to go back and close them again...What the fuck am I wasting my time, fuck this shit.  I'm going out and reclose last week's... +++$+++ 1990s
Just fine. +++$+++ 1950s
Nah. +++$+++ 1990s
You fucked us over. +++$+++ 2000s
Five? +++$+++ 1990s
I want to talk to you. +++$+++ 1940s
Engaged. +++$+++ 2000s
...Congratulations, kid, you've really outdone yourself. Reinvented the wheel. I'm going to recommend to the Board that we proceed immediately with this, uh... with the, uh... that the dingus be mass-produced with all deliberate speed. Of course, as president of the company the ultimate decision is yours. +++$+++ 1990s
I didn't. I got a job, too.  I wonder if that hurt her, my not letting her sacrifice for me?  Some people are so willing to suffer for you that they suffer more if you don't let them. +++$+++ 1960s
He no longer roars or spits. He no longer taunts the guards or molests his fellow wards -- +++$+++ 2000s
Helen-Thomas-Webber!  Maybe we have been down here a little too long!  Please excuse her French. +++$+++ 1990s
He was getting on . . . and then this man with luggage and . . .  oh, it's a long story. +++$+++ 1980s
That the virus was taken from Philadelphia to San Francisco, then to New Orleans, Rio de Janeiro, Rome, Kinshasa, Karachi, Bangkok, then Peking. +++$+++ 1990s
Those are my clothes. +++$+++ 1990s
Are you open? +++$+++ 1990s
Gibarian was under enormous -- +++$+++ 2000s
Not really. +++$+++ 1990s
Maybe he's talking to himself. +++$+++ 2010s
I don't wanna work at all. +++$+++ 1930s
You think things would be any different now? +++$+++ 1990s
Okay, ma'am, just a moment. +++$+++ 1990s
But the point is Dickie -- well we know this -- Dickie loves Marge and he misses her and apparently he's come to his senses... +++$+++ 1990s
Yeah. +++$+++ 1980s
Oh. +++$+++ 1940s
Yeah. +++$+++ 1990s
HARRY Dunne. +++$+++ 2000s
Wow. Hey, I was just about to order some dinner. You eat Chinese, right? +++$+++ 1990s
Perhaps. +++$+++ 1930s
'U.S.S Indianapolis.' 1944. +++$+++ 1970s
These can be such trying situations everyone seems to make such a to-do over a simple little accident. Of course, they can be very frightening, and I must apologize for David, he's never had an accident before. +++$+++ 1970s
No, we're not. +++$+++ 1990s
Hi. +++$+++ 1980s
Time out! +++$+++ 1970s
He... didn't have me..  I told you- +++$+++ 1990s
How? +++$+++ 2000s
Disappointment? J'etais destroyee! I was in bed for a week! Positively sick with fury! I called in the gardener and said, 'Monsieur Gonzalez, either those azaleas come up next spring or you are terminee! +++$+++ 1990s
I'm telling you it's a forgery. The paint's still wet for God's sake. +++$+++ 1990s
I've taken the spear for a lot of people, Sway. Including you. Can't we improvise a little here ... ? +++$+++ 2000s
...So Cornelius was telling the truth! +++$+++ 1990s
What's your problem? +++$+++ 1980s
Sorry, I don't remember. +++$+++ 2000s
Be cool, man. You're having a paradoxical reaction. It can happen.  Didn't I tell you this guy was stressed out? +++$+++ 1990s
Me? +++$+++ 1980s
Stop saying you're sorry. I want information, not regrets. +++$+++ 1990s
Nancy?  Would you sit with me awhile? +++$+++ 1980s
Who do you think changed the parade route? +++$+++ 1990s
At my age, I'm going to take any pill that makes me feel better. +++$+++ 1990s
You wouldn't dare. +++$+++ 1980s
Going away doesn't mean you leave Lasher behind. He was on Rowan's deck - and the plane...  geography seems irrelevant now. +++$+++ 1990s
I told you, he's one of Dino Velvet's stock players... +++$+++ 1990s
How much time do you need? We have seventeen hours and forty-two minutes. Now: what is in the Core? +++$+++ 1990s
Was her breakfast conversation that bad? +++$+++ 2000s
It matches the pictures. +++$+++ 1990s
You should have tried harder. +++$+++ 2000s
Rachel come on. +++$+++ 1980s
I guess still in the locker. +++$+++ 1990s
Two of the horses ran off, but that pinto you're riding hung around. +++$+++ 1980s
What it will be. +++$+++ 2000s
Yes. He spoke to me. He said I would fight bravely tomorrow. I have never dreamed of Merlin before. +++$+++ 1980s
Heh heh. We wanna do her now! +++$+++ 1990s
That's the best part.  She gets it all -- everything. +++$+++ 1990s
Rinaldi... Rinaldi...  What region do you come from? +++$+++ 1990s
Yeah. +++$+++ 2000s
Maybe you should be. +++$+++ 2000s
Say, isn't this your twenty dollars? +++$+++ 1940s
I'm from Akron. +++$+++ 1990s
I've searched the entire world for you, Buffy. +++$+++ 1990s
I'm the Sufi. +++$+++ 1980s
Who's that? +++$+++ 1990s
Beverly! Not the Sterners! +++$+++ 1990s
Beat the shit out of someone who hates you. +++$+++ 1970s
Not as single-minded as the others, not as sybaritic.  Almost thoughtful. She's useless. +++$+++ 1990s
Where were you? +++$+++ 1980s
Can we go up? Do you mind? +++$+++ 1990s
Hey, <u>the movie's getting made</u>. That's the main thing. +++$+++ 1990s
And Gaston, I was happier all day long. I felt I'd contributed something. +++$+++ 1930s
Did you? +++$+++ 1970s
What is...  ...Coke? +++$+++ 1980s
Before or after the explosion?  Mueller -- +++$+++ 2000s
He didn't give you an address? He didn't give you a phone number? +++$+++ 1990s
Tomorrow night as a matter of fact. +++$+++ 1990s
Well, I mean...I wanna be on TV. Maybe have a talk show or something. Like Conan. Or early Letterman. +++$+++ 2000s
Do you know what to do? +++$+++ 1990s
I don't know... maybe I'll live on a boat, sail to all the places I've never been. +++$+++ 1990s
Got her right where you want her, Junior. +++$+++ 2000s
Please, Sylvia!  It's a quarter to nine! +++$+++ 1960s
Michael - I saw him!  Twice!  Carlotta said I  ---  killed Graham - with - with my anger. +++$+++ 1990s
I -- lost something. +++$+++ 1940s
Uh huh. +++$+++ 2000s
Don't mock, Claudia... +++$+++ 1990s
Th-th-they, they wanted me for a screen test. +++$+++ 1980s
That's ancient history.  That has nothing to do with you and I. +++$+++ 2000s
Don't want to film this? +++$+++ 2000s
You idiot. Off the record, deep background: I've got that beach crawling with undercover cops. +++$+++ 1980s
You realize what is at stake? +++$+++ 1990s
No, I don't want one.  Hey, Mr Clark, how you doin'? +++$+++ 1990s
Yes. +++$+++ 1980s
It's up there, on the Tower. +++$+++ 1990s
You don't know him. I'm so stupid. +++$+++ 1990s
Physicians are a waste of time. You'll have more luck with this charm of mine... it saved my life at Agincourt! +++$+++ 2000s
Um. +++$+++ 1970s
Shouldn't you have used a toggle bolt? +++$+++ 1990s
Jeffrey? +++$+++ 1980s
There's no lady here. +++$+++ 2000s
Do you often make a habit of sitting on strange men's beds? +++$+++ 1990s
Coupla days ago they dug up a body in Washington Heights - Mary Finelli.  Girl disappeared in '68.  Turns out she was his first kill.  Which means he probably knew her.  Most serials know their first victim.  I'm gonna do some checking - see if I can put any of this together... +++$+++ 2000s
Geoffrey's not in Cairo.  He's not actually a buffoon.  And the plane wasn't a wedding present. It belongs to the British Government.  They want aerial maps of the whole North Africa. So I think he's in Ethiopia.  In case you were counting on his sudden appearance. +++$+++ 1990s
Oh, shit. +++$+++ 1990s
I'm not mad.  I am, but I'm not.  Y'know? +++$+++ 1990s
I waited up till midnight. +++$+++ 1950s
I don't know. +++$+++ 2000s
Ahhh...nothing. +++$+++ 1980s
Two hundred meters. +++$+++ 1980s
Where? +++$+++ 1980s
Tore up from the floor up? +++$+++ 2000s
Nothing, if you work in a fill- ing station.  And I'm getting rather bored with that sport jacket, and those same baggy pants.  Max, what's a good men's shop in town?  The very best... Well, go there ! +++$+++ 1950s
We're having some problems with ARCADE... +++$+++ 1990s
What about the staff?  They’re in on what’s going on, aren’t they?  How many of them? +++$+++ 1990s
That's good. At least they're interested. +++$+++ 1990s
We'll deal with that when we come to it.  <u>This</u> is producing.  <u>This</u> is what they pay off on...come on, Pal, Boots and Saddles... +++$+++ 1990s
I'm a bowler. +++$+++ 1990s
Now. You say the driveway's on your side of the house. So I guess you don't sleep in the same room. +++$+++ 1960s
Don't wake the kids... +++$+++ 1990s
For a movie? +++$+++ 1990s
Perhaps I was never meant to live with a woman... +++$+++ 1990s
Tell him what, what do you want me to tell him? +++$+++ 1990s
I'm sure he could give you some courage. +++$+++ 1930s
"I can always find someplace else to work. Someplace that'll pay me a fortune and give me a view of the French Riviera ..." +++$+++ 2000s
They're --  -- What? +++$+++ 1990s
Well, he got away, didn't he?  Riding a donkey not far from here when the lion sprang on them- donkey took the brunt of it- then suddenly the lion ran off. +++$+++ 1990s
I... feel.... pretty. +++$+++ 1990s
Hey, watch it! +++$+++ 1990s
There's other things to be learned. +++$+++ 2000s
I hear he's around Palm Springs. Dealing our product. Product we sold to you for five hundred thousand dollars.  Why do you keep talking to me bullshit? I think maybe I have Ramon and Ceasar staple your tongue to your chin. What do you think? +++$+++ 1990s
It is waiting for you in the garage. +++$+++ 1970s
Goodbye, Mr. Fielding. +++$+++ 1950s
Maybe there was traffic. +++$+++ 1990s
Elizabeth! Little Elizabeth! Why you're so... middle aged! +++$+++ 1990s
Sometime after 1:00 a guy's gonna call here and give you the name of a horse.  All you do is take this two grand across the street to Shaw's place and bet it on that pony.  There's nothin' to it, but don't take too much time.  We only have 3 or 4 minutes after you get the call. +++$+++ 1970s
No, I can't. You know what I heard the other day? "Heartbeat-It's Lovebeat," by little Tony DeFranco and the DeFranco Family. I haven't heard that since I was in fifth fuckin' grade. +++$+++ 1990s
MARK IT ZERO! +++$+++ 1990s
I want you to hurt me. +++$+++ 1990s
I don't have your number, stop by the shop. +++$+++ 1970s
Want a list? +++$+++ 1990s
Places where the road bends, places away from buildings, places where the traffic thins out. But you don't have to understand. I do. So no talking. +++$+++ 2000s
That's not Paul Owen. Paul Owen's on the other side of the room. Over there. +++$+++ 2000s
Huh? +++$+++ 1950s
Yes. +++$+++ 1990s
Invite me in, Pike. +++$+++ 1990s
What. +++$+++ 1990s
He would take you on.  Yes. +++$+++ 1990s
I guess you're,right.  Well, what do you say we get a little midnight snack? Theo's should still be open. +++$+++ 1980s
You know? +++$+++ 1980s
Jesus... +++$+++ 1990s
He just wanted a few minutes before -- +++$+++ 2000s
I was supposed to take the children to New England next week. +++$+++ 1970s
Give me some credit. I got you this far, let's go to the grand jury. This is never going to stop if we - +++$+++ 1990s
They'll be sending you up there soon enough. And not just for a visit, neither. +++$+++ 2000s
We have to stop meeting like this. +++$+++ 1990s
Satan's in this little fella tonight! +++$+++ 1930s
Katherine?... Katherine who? +++$+++ 1970s
Oh. I see. +++$+++ 1990s
Staff sargeant detailed me to prepare firewood for the break- fast cooking. +++$+++ 1980s
Diane? +++$+++ 2000s
Usual bullshit.  You make one smart move and everybody wants to be your friend... You know somethin', shootin' guys sucks. Especially compared to this. +++$+++ 1980s
I found him. +++$+++ 1990s
Why are you doing this? +++$+++ 1990s
Anything today? +++$+++ 1950s
...I want to....I want so many things, Claudia. Maybe we can just talk to straighten our things out....there are so many things that I want to tell you -- +++$+++ 1990s
Then you came to a desert and mountains... +++$+++ 2000s
Deals? +++$+++ 2000s
Hey, I brought some friends. And some beer. +++$+++ 1980s
Uni High Tigers, sir. Don't you remember ? I was captain of the team. +++$+++ 1990s
There's going to be some irate citizens when they find out they're paying for water they're not getting. +++$+++ 1970s
Jump in. +++$+++ 1990s
That's very linear Sheriff. +++$+++ 2000s
Shut your ass up and grab the wall! +++$+++ 1990s
She's the one to blame. Not me. +++$+++ 1990s
I better do this, Stan. +++$+++ 2000s
Who said it wa's me, hub?  Anyway... he fell off a ladder.  It wasn't really my fault. +++$+++ 2000s
Does Dorothy know her husband is dead? +++$+++ 1980s
Then don't. +++$+++ 1990s
I'm tellin' you, she'll be there, I know she'll be there. Dressed up and everything. +++$+++ 1980s
If he's reasonable, maybe we can make some kind of deal. If not. We'll have to re-consider our options. +++$+++ 2000s
In a little while. That's what you want, isn't it? +++$+++ 1960s
There's a guy down the hall.  Complaining about the noise.  Says he can't sleep. +++$+++ 2000s
And he's a patient of yours? +++$+++ 1990s
I'm sure she found your lectures fascinating. +++$+++ 1990s
Claire, Claire, Claire, if you're not dead, he's going to assume you're with me. +++$+++ 1990s
Hey, you guys, what's going on? +++$+++ 1980s
The way you drove that car, I figured you for the streets. +++$+++ 1980s
That's no way to talk... +++$+++ 1950s
What do you do for a living? +++$+++ 1970s
You blew it -- big time.  She doesn't want you back. +++$+++ 1990s
They want me to do things for them. +++$+++ 1990s
My house. +++$+++ 1990s
Your husband returned at, what, seven o'clock? +++$+++ 1990s
There's a light up ahead. +++$+++ 2000s
Thanks Walter. +++$+++ 1990s
What run him off? Tell me that! +++$+++ 1990s
Oh, Ted, please be careful. I worry about you so much. +++$+++ 1980s
He's right. You'd feel much better about it. +++$+++ 1990s
I'll kill myself. +++$+++ 1970s
You really use strong language. +++$+++ 1990s
That's going to fit me? +++$+++ 1990s
Now? +++$+++ 1990s
Stop it, stop it, you satanic whore! +++$+++ 2000s
Well? Supper at my place? +++$+++ 1970s
Who are you? +++$+++ 1940s
But, Bishop... +++$+++ 1990s
This is nuts. +++$+++ 1990s
She just called.  She doesn't even know.  It's probably the last time I'll ever hear her voice.  That's weird, isn't it?  You spend Christmas at somebody's house, you know, and you worry about their operations and you see them in their bathrobe, and... I dunno... +++$+++ 2000s
I'm a little worried, James. +++$+++ 2000s
Yes I am. +++$+++ 1960s
How fortunate. +++$+++ 1980s
We are trying to stand out. Right near his address. Easier to get them to come to us, than to try and find them. ..now keep your eyes open, something might present itself. +++$+++ 1980s
No joke. This is probably the best hamburger I've ever had. I'm serious, I've never had a hamburger taste this good. +++$+++ 1990s
I always wanted to go to Zegema Beach. +++$+++ 1990s
...we, we love her, Dick and me... +++$+++ 1980s
"Love your enemies"... +++$+++ 2000s
So why did you need the Addam's Family mansion for a scientific test? +++$+++ 1990s
Then I guess Walter can kiss that arm of his goodbye.  He don't use it for no good deeds anyway. +++$+++ 1990s
Can I hold him? +++$+++ 1980s
Y'know? I'm sure of it. Y'know? And there's a strong streak of goody- goody in him that is going to blow this deal for me if I don't do something about it.  Something! +++$+++ 1970s
I know your mad at me, okay, but I can't let you do this. +++$+++ 2000s
One of the plagues on members of Congress--office-seekers, cranks, people with pet bills. Get my son into West Point--or *outta* West Point. I've got a scheme to put people to work. How do I get rid of cockroaches? Some woman's composed a hymn to replace the Star Spangled Banner. Want to hear it? +++$+++ 1930s
Good morning to you, Mr. Delapot. +++$+++ 2000s
Why don't you just stick your finger in and stir it up. +++$+++ 1990s
Six rounds. 357. +++$+++ 1990s
I'm just going to get the name of their truck! +++$+++ 1950s
Police. They have their head in their asshole and they still can't find shit. +++$+++ 1990s
Oh, yes, that's right. +++$+++ 1960s
Stop it. +++$+++ 1970s
Congress has informed the army that it is bankrupt and cannot pay the soldiers pensions. +++$+++ 2000s
I'm not sure yet. I've had a shock recently, and I'm only beginning to get over it. Perhaps I'll go back to the convent one day. +++$+++ 1960s
Holy shit. That girl? +++$+++ 1990s
Git up. I got sump'n to show you. +++$+++ 1940s
I'll bet he's got an opinion on the stock market too. This apartment is already ahead of its time. I call it the "demolished" look. They've already heard about it at House and Garden and they're coming next week to photograph it before it gets... lived in. Is that alright? I'd love to have it in my portfolio. +++$+++ 1980s
You bet I've got a better offer. +++$+++ 1940s
AHHH!! The wine cellar!! In a bottle of Chateau Margaux. A metal cylinder... Don't... Don't - AAAAH! +++$+++ 1990s
Throw your gun down now! +++$+++ 1970s
For what? +++$+++ 1990s
I would not know. Maybe. +++$+++ 1990s
I think on account of his nose. +++$+++ 2000s
My writing career! Your hair written by Clementine Kruczynski.  The Tom Waits album is Rain Dogs. +++$+++ 2000s
A champagne cocktail, please. +++$+++ 1940s
How long you here, Joe? +++$+++ 1990s
I'm sorry... +++$+++ 2000s
There's a compass in the handle. +++$+++ 1980s
Sounds intriguing. +++$+++ 1990s
Aunt May, what happened? +++$+++ 2000s
What do you know about boats? I bet you can't even swim. +++$+++ 2000s
Yeah, just a nip. I feel like hell, all the carryings-on next door. +++$+++ 1990s
Where shall we go for dinner? +++$+++ 1950s
Well, thank you Mistuh Sleep 'N Eat. +++$+++ 2000s
Oz. +++$+++ 1990s
Jon, he's hooked up to a full-spectrum polygraph. No one has ever beaten -- +++$+++ 1990s
And yourself too in the process. God, you're so beautiful. Why couldn't I see that before? +++$+++ 1990s
Cause he was a liar. And I hated him.  "Get your head out of that machine, wise up to the real world." The more he mocked me the deeper I went. Cause if being savvy meant being like him --  Guess that's why I'm kind of clueless, even now. Didn't cultivate my conniving side. 'Not sure I even have one. +++$+++ 2000s
Yes? +++$+++ 2000s
As God is my witness, I have never done anything to that woman. +++$+++ 1990s
You won't be committing a crime. The man will cheat, you'll just be doing your job, that's all. +++$+++ 1990s
Watch out for that tree. +++$+++ 1990s
What about the rules? +++$+++ 1990s
I'm fine. Yes. I'm fine. +++$+++ 1990s
You feel? +++$+++ 1990s
"And her ritual feast continues as she prepares to make a sacrifice out of the seventh fiance.  So all bets are on and we hope that this boomerang bride isn't honeymooning with Las Vegas odds makers because many predict that this girl is out of there before the race... before the rice hits the ground"  Holy moly. +++$+++ 1990s
I'll get her.  Have a good Christmas, Matt.... +++$+++ 1980s
CARTMAN! +++$+++ 1990s
What? +++$+++ 2000s
Good day to you, M'Lords. +++$+++ 1990s
I have the letters right here. +++$+++ 1940s
Either it goes to Mitchell or it comes here. +++$+++ 1990s
A slight, a slight, well, no, we're gonna <u>deal</u> with it, we just, I need a little readjustment...we need to re<u>think</u>... +++$+++ 1990s
So, Mark's working at the State Department now. +++$+++ 2000s
Absolutely. +++$+++ 1990s
Sure, on me.  I got Diner's Club. +++$+++ 1970s
Wonder what's happened to Fenner. +++$+++ 1930s
Yeah. I'll go check on your boy. +++$+++ 1990s
Undoubtedly. Not the ascetics of course but, well Saint Thomas More... +++$+++ 1980s
Won't your father help you with that? +++$+++ 1990s
I will not have any damned ultimatums put to me, Lou.  I'll accept your resignation. +++$+++ 1990s
I reckon Mr. Woolridge got me hired on to work for Bill Cox's outfit. +++$+++ 1990s
I don't know.  It just woke me up. +++$+++ 1970s
They've never caught him before, what makes you think they'll catch him now? +++$+++ 1990s
Don't you dare touch me!  What the devil do you think you're doing? +++$+++ 1960s
Excuse me, Agent Mackelway? +++$+++ 2000s
That's the beauty of the system. This is a fugitive chat room. It moves from place to place, chat rooms that are normally empty at certain hours: a gardening website, Chaucer buffs, a dating service. A pre- arranged code shows up in one of fifty porn rooms -- that's where I stumbled across it -- notifying "friends" to meet at a certain time, usually midnight to three Eastern Standard, at a certain website -- a deserted chat room, say, "How to Plant Perennials." Come Tuesday, twelve a.m., bingo, these like-minded deviates log on and start yakking it up: explicit sex crime gossip, who did what to whom, who wants to do what, when, why and how. +++$+++ 2000s
Like Cocoa Puffs.  Good.  Captain Crunch.  Bad.  Shreds the roof of your mouth.  I mean you hear, "Tricks are for kids!"  And you think, "I'm a kid, I guess they're for me."  But your baby brain's got no idea that Fruit Loops are, like, a million times better.  I'm going to save our kid all that pain. +++$+++ 2000s
I give you my soul... +++$+++ 1930s
Non.  Please. +++$+++ 1990s
No, Mr. Lounds. You'll be just fine. +++$+++ 1980s
So do I. +++$+++ 1950s
What are your favorite buildings, David? +++$+++ 1980s
No, all the good ones are married. That's why Brad thinks he's God's gift to women. This woman anyway. He's single. He won't take no for an answer, but he's the only one who's asking. And he knows it. +++$+++ 1980s
Like gang-busters. Now, remember, if you don't want to go to jail, we gotta put your boss in jail. +++$+++ 1990s
How did it happen? +++$+++ 1990s
We can't be sure of that. +++$+++ 1940s
Yes laddie, I have her. +++$+++ 1980s
And this, only one of these letters, Major. I have lots of them. +++$+++ 2000s
Maybe you're right. +++$+++ 1980s
Good.  I've got a broken back from carrying you all these years anyway. +++$+++ 2000s
What does it look like I'm doing? +++$+++ 1990s
Yeah, you do that huckleberry. I'll still be here. +++$+++ 1980s
Yes, I could smell it on his breath, like I can on your's. +++$+++ 1990s
Laws don't touch men like Thaddeus Rains. Only justice does. +++$+++ 2000s
Me too. +++$+++ 1990s
I didn't shoot West... +++$+++ 2000s
I never thought it would end.  Then it did.  It was so great to be saved, I couldn't stop laughing. +++$+++ 2000s
Fine. We hit this bank. +++$+++ 2000s
That works on my nerves, you bein' so buddy-buddy with him. +++$+++ 1990s
You fucked up little prick! +++$+++ 1980s
Mr. President, the press guys asked if you could come back for a minute. +++$+++ 1990s
It was on your shirt! +++$+++ 1980s
It... was nothing.  A nightmare, nothing more.  Go away, I -- +++$+++ 1990s
Well, then, I--I *thank* you, Miss Saunders! Nothing better could have happened--. Yes *sir*, Miss Saunders, we're going right ahead with it! +++$+++ 1930s
One of yours? +++$+++ 1980s
Okay. +++$+++ 1970s
Why not? +++$+++ 1980s
I did that for your own good, fella.  Now I'm not going to pull rank on you.  When this is over, I'll be happy to step outside with you and settle this thing.  Right now my orders are to locate General Ripper and put him on the phone with the President. +++$+++ 1960s
Maybe because you're looking her in the face. +++$+++ 2000s
Right, right... +++$+++ 1990s
And what are you like? A wino? +++$+++ 2000s
How often is that? +++$+++ 1960s
Dil, this is Jude. +++$+++ 1990s
'Dem dat hides can finds says I'... I seen him, the clever tit, sneaking looks at it late at night, talking to it. +++$+++ 1970s
Wallowing in sin and lust... +++$+++ 1990s
You're really twisted, Gordon. You're incapable of giving to anybody because deep down inside you there's a poverty that every last dollar in the world won't fill. +++$+++ 1980s
Two years. +++$+++ 2000s
Eight and twenty-four. +++$+++ 1980s
Now you're talking... +++$+++ 2000s
Miss Clara's boy, Emory, to start with. The Johnson's Hocker was another one... +++$+++ 1990s
[What is his name?] +++$+++ 2000s
What about you? You haven't eaten in days. How come you're never on this side of the microscope? +++$+++ 2000s
No problem.  We're in. +++$+++ 1990s
I had immense plans. +++$+++ 1970s
It's a little late. +++$+++ 2000s
Which gives us about five hours. Why'd you call me? +++$+++ 2000s
Oh, I fell on my keys.  I've got to get out of here. +++$+++ 1960s
Get to what? +++$+++ 1940s
Enterprise maintaining full impulse power... +++$+++ 1980s
No, I mean if he can get in, maybe I have a chance. +++$+++ 1990s
You brought a fucking Pomeranian bowling? +++$+++ 1990s
I like banks.  That's where the money is. +++$+++ 1990s
From Interpol? +++$+++ 1990s
Majesty! +++$+++ 1980s
I'm really very sorry - I was banking on this coming through, because it's only five minutes from my surgery... +++$+++ 1990s
One guarantee.  Payment's entirely at your brother's discretion and, as a gift, dependent on your satisfaction. +++$+++ 1990s
I loved my taxi. Went twelve hours nonstop. Stopped only to pee. I peed under the Manhattan bridge. Peed many times in parks and playgrounds. +++$+++ 2000s
I can't handle that thing. +++$+++ 1980s
They are singing for me. +++$+++ 1950s
Since when?  Usually you leave 'em with nothing but a kick in the teeth. +++$+++ 1950s
I'd turn around, but I'm afraid you'd strangle me. +++$+++ 1980s
Al, as far as you're concerned, I'm the Don. +++$+++ 1970s
Mace, the guy had a knife.  To my throat.  In my living room. Relaxing might be right out, okay?! +++$+++ 1990s
Oh, here you are, Justice Zinnowitz -- I'm at cross-purposes with these gentlemen -- will you clear up the situation? +++$+++ 1930s
It's my belief that Dolores was doing exactly what she'd been doing for years.  Besides, the school board's insurance on Dolores is minimal.  A few million at the very most.  The really deep pockets are to be found in the town, or in the company that made the bus. +++$+++ 1990s
Okay. +++$+++ 1970s
He told me he was going to Hell. +++$+++ 1990s
So talk to me tomorrow.  After the gig. +++$+++ 1980s
Rod -- +++$+++ 1990s
Which way? +++$+++ 1980s
She's definitely part of this.  It's weird, for a while Ivy was all I could think about.  But then... +++$+++ 1940s
Lisa Fremont. +++$+++ 1950s
Dr. Argon, I demand an explanation. +++$+++ 1990s
His name is Frank. +++$+++ 2000s
How many points you got left on your license? +++$+++ 1990s
I'd like to use the sanitary facilities, if I may. +++$+++ 1970s
You'd think I was mad. +++$+++ 1980s
Give me the address. +++$+++ 2000s
Listen, what is this? What do you want? +++$+++ 1950s
Would you be willing to have dinner with me? +++$+++ 1990s
Darling, calm down. Why do you need a lawyer? Haven't you your little Volga boatman? +++$+++ 1930s
It will not be long before Longshanks too is encased in stone, and his crowns divided for others to wear. +++$+++ 1990s
Surely you know the one who made you... +++$+++ 1990s
Yeah.  Happening, isn't it? +++$+++ 1990s
When you need us, you love us, when you don't, we're shunned by the rest of the department. +++$+++ 2000s
How did you spot the ambush in Torrell? +++$+++ 2000s
...because if you don't, they die... +++$+++ 2000s
That what he says. Right? +++$+++ 1960s
How can I? You lied to me -- the way Charles did -- and after promising you wouldn't. Oh, I want to believe you, Peter... oh, but I can't call you that anymore, can I? It will take me a while to get used to your new name -- which I don't even know yet. What is it?  Aren't you going to tell me?  Hello -- ? +++$+++ 1960s
Now, Nuke, would I do a thing like that?  Hey kids, this is the great Ebby Calvin "Nuke" LaLoosh. +++$+++ 1980s
Diego is a bright boy -- a pleasure to teach -- but so serious... Brothers should be raised together, Colon.  Even brothers from different mothers... +++$+++ 1990s
You know, here we are having coffee together, and discussing education and business and economy...and we don't even know each other's names...full names I mean. +++$+++ 1980s
Thanks, but Miss Dawson and I are going out to see the sights. +++$+++ 1930s
Uh father, I know she's been through a lot... but the sacred stones..we don't have much time.. +++$+++ 1990s
Uh, narcolepsy. +++$+++ 1970s
Good hunting. Hayes out. +++$+++ 1990s
I want to be able to see us, Nick. I... I'm going to go into the bathroom now and put in my contacts, OK? Is that OK?  I want to be able to see us when we make love, OK? +++$+++ 1970s
Smart aleck! +++$+++ 1930s
We'll think of something. +++$+++ 2000s
You came out early. +++$+++ 2000s
I can and I am and I will - tomorrow! I gotta think about the little Wharvey gals! They look to me for answers! Vernon can s'port 'em and buy 'em lessons on the clarinet! The only good thing you ever did for the gals was get his by that train! +++$+++ 2000s
Will you meet with him? +++$+++ 2000s
Nothing.  It's just not there. +++$+++ 2000s
And what do you think you will find in another land? +++$+++ 1990s
Lord Nelson, Napoleon's troops.  I fear for the women and the property values. +++$+++ 1990s
I think it's time we got some professional help. +++$+++ 1990s
All right, but later. I've got a meeting now. +++$+++ 1950s
Baby, I'm in the middle of work. +++$+++ 1970s
I'm sorry. +++$+++ 1980s
What is it? +++$+++ 1990s
I gotta use the phone. +++$+++ 1990s
Who's your friend? +++$+++ 1980s
No -- +++$+++ 1990s
No! +++$+++ 1970s
Boys, boys... don't forget Russia is your mother country. Three sons walking out all at once... that's too much for any mother. +++$+++ 1930s
You're irresistible.  I lose control. +++$+++ 1980s
And God said to Avram, take yourself away from your land and from the place you were born and from your father's house into the land -- a different land -- and I will show you.... +++$+++ 2000s
Don't you have to finish the game ? +++$+++ 1990s
What a ridiculous thing to say. +++$+++ 1990s
Showing Vicki what she missed out on by being such a dull kid.  Now, the first thing you need in making a prank call is, of course, a phone.  This one, for instance. +++$+++ 1990s
Well, to tell you the truth, I'm having some trouble getting started– +++$+++ 1990s
Yeah. +++$+++ 1980s
Yes ... Tommy.  What are you doing here? +++$+++ 1990s
You don't really -- +++$+++ 2000s
INT. ICE CREAM TRUCK/BOX - DAY. +++$+++ 1990s
Thank you, sir. +++$+++ 1960s
I don't want to hear about your fucking dreams! +++$+++ 1980s
Do you know it? +++$+++ 2000s
What do you expect me to do about it? +++$+++ 1970s
Yeah, just started. +++$+++ 1940s
The law says people with disabilities cannot be terminated, so long as they can perform the duties required by their position... +++$+++ 1990s
You sure you know how to do this. +++$+++ 1980s
Got it. So take a walk, Ben... I'm going to borrow Susan for a second. +++$+++ 2000s
I know, I know--I have that dream all the time.  We're almost home. +++$+++ 1980s
I'm workin' on it. But she doesn't seem to be goin' for him. +++$+++ 1990s
And get a bunch of fools sniffin' around here? +++$+++ 2000s
I was not. +++$+++ 2000s
Hopefully the whole sad chapter is over.  And everyone, including your family, will find peace. WILL I just want to...thank all of you, for everything you've done for us. +++$+++ 1990s
It's actually been giving me Freddy nightmares. +++$+++ 1990s
And what do you do, Lucy? +++$+++ 1990s
You have a really nice place here...Paul. How much did you pay for it? +++$+++ 2000s
Ninotchka, you know I am your friend, you can trust me.... Did you bring back anything else? +++$+++ 1930s
Toys for... adults? +++$+++ 2000s
What'll I do if something comes up? +++$+++ 1930s
Ahh, there is yet time. +++$+++ 1960s
Oh, come on, we've seen it. I'm not in the mood to see a four-hour documentary on Nazis. +++$+++ 1970s
You're a couple o' sticks shy in your column, Ann. +++$+++ 1940s
The set-up is wrong.  We're doing all the legwork, and at the end of the day, we're still paying retail.  We're getting middled. +++$+++ 2000s
Incredible, isn't it? Well, I think John has had enough visitors for one day, Mothershead. I've got a lecture at the college, I'll be back this evening. +++$+++ 1980s
Thank God this plate was already fixed. +++$+++ 1990s
I know... +++$+++ 2000s
I know precisely where he'll be. +++$+++ 1990s
Andrew -- HOW DARE YOU!!  For all we knew, you were DYING!  Look at your mother -- she's still shaking! +++$+++ 1990s
Right. +++$+++ 1970s
You know what a hurry we're in. +++$+++ 1980s
Oh!  Oh, Zeke!  Help!  Help me, Zeke!  Get me out of here!  Help! +++$+++ 1930s
Give him the you-know-what. +++$+++ 1980s
From that moment on, I foresaw what I might be.  Already I felt the earth flee beneath me, as if I were being carried away up to the sky. +++$+++ 1990s
Let me come, too.  Please don't leave me alone. +++$+++ 1970s
Lizard DNA and human DNA on the same strand?  Impossible.  The sample must be contaminated. +++$+++ 1990s
Shopping, really? I should tell my friend. +++$+++ 2000s
I know.  Help me get a sample. +++$+++ 1990s
Well someone clearly let him out before Monica opened the gate. +++$+++ 2000s
I'm no spy -- where do I fit in? +++$+++ 1990s
Which is why I hoped you'd snub him. +++$+++ 1990s
This is the front entrance, right? You get through the slots, you hit craps here, not blackjack. Blackjack's here to here -- lined up. What's this, the cage? Cage is over there, hard to get to, you got it all mixed around -- +++$+++ 2000s
I'm not screwing around with you man...I hate the cold water. +++$+++ 1990s
Didn't ya think, Mary? +++$+++ 2000s
Way to go, Mom! +++$+++ 1980s
At last!   A call!  A cry of distress ...  Concorde!  Brave, Concorde ... you shall not have died in vain! +++$+++ 1970s
I could give it some thought, Ben, but my leg is very sore. +++$+++ 1970s
I don't know it was made out of driftwood and dipped in sulfuric acid.  It was out there... +++$+++ 1950s
I helped. +++$+++ 1990s
Hah! No, I'm not. Actually, I used to be, but the therapist I had was really ineffectual in helping me deal with my problems. Of course, I lied to him constantly, so I guess I can't hold him totally responsible... +++$+++ 1980s
No thanks. I had some. How would you like to take a walk for, say, half and hour? +++$+++ 1990s
Gatorade. +++$+++ 1990s
I... No. +++$+++ 1990s
End of the road, boys. It's had its twists and turns - +++$+++ 2000s
Well, Sammy's dead. Yeah, fell over in the bed with a chick twenty years younger than him. Had twenty-five grand in his pocket. +++$+++ 1990s
No. No. That's not it. We don't kill him. We don't kill anybody. But I like the way you're thinking. You're focused and you're trying to follow. No, what we need to do is start a fake Special Needs class. +++$+++ 2000s
I know. I write like a child. +++$+++ 1990s
I guess I would've felt sorry for the universe. +++$+++ 1990s
I hate sucking dick! +++$+++ 1990s
Listen to it, Brian... Jump when I say... It won't get us. +++$+++ 1990s
I don't want the job.  Don't do that to her.  She's worked too damned hard for it. +++$+++ 1990s
Okay. Tell me. What's the Five Point Plan? +++$+++ 1980s
Good thing in a situation like this. +++$+++ 2000s
I cannot, Athos.  Dearly as I love you, I cannot. +++$+++ 1990s
I think he's moved... +++$+++ 2000s
-- no -- Marie -- <u>no</u>! -- it's not like that -- +++$+++ 2000s
No further questions. +++$+++ 1980s
You wish to close this account today? +++$+++ 1990s
Well, I was thinkin' about smokin' actually... My mama smokes Marlboros now, used to be she smoked Kools? I stole 'em from her beginnin' in about sixth grade. When I got old enough to buy my own, I bought those. Now I've just about settled on Mores, as you probably noticed? They're longer. +++$+++ 1990s
Will you shut up... Just give me a drink. +++$+++ 1960s
Oh yeah? +++$+++ 1990s
It's further than I thought... a worm is sure to come....  I'll plant a thumper, that should divert it. -- Paul moves off into the shadows.  Suddenly, Jessica SEES a burst of LIGHTNING illuminate the mountain of rock in the distant and the vast dunes before them. +++$+++ 1980s
You know each other? +++$+++ 1990s
You and Kathryn gonna stay here? +++$+++ 1980s
He only appears to be inside the cage.  The point being... +++$+++ 1990s
Hey . . . hey. Where did the Building and Loan move to? +++$+++ 1940s
Wednesday next. Frank looks across the room at Jack. +++$+++ 1980s
I came to find my grandfather. +++$+++ 1980s
Oh, come, Madam -- please come. +++$+++ 1930s
You're going to have to stop this disturbance or I shall arrest you. +++$+++ 1980s
Malaysia's tanking.  We're meeting in ten in operations. +++$+++ 2000s
That bad? +++$+++ 1990s
Professor, what's the history of this house? +++$+++ 2000s
It's Grandma. I can't talk to her now.  I'm sorry, Grandma. +++$+++ 1980s
You're entitled. +++$+++ 1950s
L.A.P.D. +++$+++ 2000s
You and I should work together. +++$+++ 1940s
Then do you propose to arrest all of us, Citizen Lieutenant?  For I was not there alone. +++$+++ 1990s
Look at this.  An ambyloid reovirus protein.  That explains why the computer's confused.  The plant's infected with a virus. +++$+++ 1990s
At some point a man's got to get serious about his future. I'm sure you have no idea what I'm talking about. +++$+++ 2000s
Sit down! +++$+++ 1990s
If you say so. +++$+++ 1990s
I worked Vice, Narcotics... Violent Crimes... and I saw every known depravity.  I was lost, Mace.  In outer darkness.  Then I busted this strung-out little teeny-hooker. When I met Faith she was just another runaway giving twenty dollar blowjobs to buy crank.  Another lost soul. +++$+++ 1990s
Cool pictures.  You a fan? +++$+++ 1990s
Thank you. +++$+++ 1980s
I already told you I'm not. +++$+++ 1950s
Cancel lunch.  Make reservations at Campton Place for me and Mr. Butts. +++$+++ 1990s
What's all this for, more security? +++$+++ 1990s
Sorry, can you give us a moment? +++$+++ 2000s
Let's waste him.  No offense. +++$+++ 1980s
Besides, it's historically inaccurate. +++$+++ 1990s
He left the club with his girlfriend about midnight.  That's the last time anybody saw him. +++$+++ 1990s
Engine room! What's happening?! +++$+++ 1980s
Take my advice.  Get the hell out of there.  It's a bad place.  Always has been. +++$+++ 2000s
How many you see? +++$+++ 2000s
But there may be a few around somewhere. +++$+++ 1970s
And you play cricket?. +++$+++ 1990s
Cop. +++$+++ 2000s
So why're you even considering it? Are you? +++$+++ 1990s
Look, maybe I should just... +++$+++ 2000s
What do your friends call you? +++$+++ 1990s
God, I hope that thing didn't bring down a virus. +++$+++ 1990s
Christ, I smoke a pack-and-a-half a day, and I tell myself I could be worse.  It's just so damned pleasurable. +++$+++ 1990s
You can't just stay out half the night and carry on, Jeffrey. There's got to be some order, Jeffrey. I thought it would have been nice to call your father when you got home but now it is much too late. +++$+++ 1990s
'Respected journalist'-- On your knees... +++$+++ 1990s
I can't stand a voyeur. I'll be back. +++$+++ 1990s
Are you asking this committee to believe that you attended a meeting of a communist party front organization in order to impress a girl? +++$+++ 2000s
Shadow games ... +++$+++ 2000s
You know Rach, Discount Mart is having a sale on Halloween costumes. +++$+++ 1980s
You better check on it, Mr. Dunn.  I'll stay here and fly the ship. +++$+++ 1980s
Anything like work aroun' here? +++$+++ 1940s
It better be. +++$+++ 1990s
You're right. It's your version. You should come over to the studio sometime. +++$+++ 1990s
I used to go with him...I don't know where the hell he is.  I haven't seen him for two weeks. And I don't think I will.  He owes me money... +++$+++ 1980s
That's okay, you... we-we can walk to the curb from here. +++$+++ 1970s
I.. +++$+++ 2000s
Does Rachel make a lot of money? +++$+++ 1990s
No, there's no other way. +++$+++ 1960s
You're making it out like we're friends here or something. I met him alone twice. +++$+++ 2000s
That's good. That's very good. Now Harold, you go out and gas up the Ford, check the oil and tires, we don't want any problems on the road. One more thing... If anybody but you comes back... +++$+++ 1970s
Oh, are you a spy for the other side? +++$+++ 1950s
Then I'm glad I lost the bag! I'll write you the check immediately. +++$+++ 1930s
Yeah. A real tragedy. +++$+++ 2000s
Why didn't you mention it in your letters? +++$+++ 1980s
You should see the other bitch. What time you got? +++$+++ 1990s
Need any disks? +++$+++ 2000s
Of what? +++$+++ 1990s
I thought Heller was a double op? +++$+++ 2000s
Can I help you, Mrs. Argon? +++$+++ 1990s
It's nothing, Doc.  Just a... touch of indigestion... something. +++$+++ 1990s
You were great. +++$+++ 1950s
My husband didn’t need to slap me about, Mr Lombard. I volunteered... +++$+++ 1990s
Poor dear... Let's get you back in bed and I'll get them for you. +++$+++ 1990s
Hey Bob, come on! Talk to me hunh, it's your friend Red, I'm only asking you for three days chief... +++$+++ 1980s
Did you say..."Peggy"? +++$+++ 1980s
It's nothing - it just goes up - it's the safest thing in the world. Safer than a car.  Don't worry about it, Sal - it'll be all right ... they're great ... +++$+++ 1970s
Who are you? +++$+++ 1980s
Why? She's a junkie. +++$+++ 1970s
This the right place? +++$+++ 1980s
Did he ever mention specifically a girl or woman in New York? +++$+++ 1970s
I didn't protect him, lady. He trusted me. And I didn't protect him... His father...I lost his father to the streets and now, Chuy... +++$+++ 1990s
Hello. +++$+++ 1990s
He has a six months lease, and has used up a little over five and a half months of it.  Quiet. Drinks, but not to drunkenness. Pays his bill promptly, with money earned as a consume jewelry salesman -- wholesale. Keeps to himself, and none of the neighbors got close to him, or his wife. +++$+++ 1950s
What was that all about? +++$+++ 1990s
That depends on the man. +++$+++ 1990s
Yes? +++$+++ 1980s
Thanks. I thought I was gonna have to go to the hospital. +++$+++ 1990s
General Greene? +++$+++ 2000s
I'm going to stay with you until you fall asleep.  And then I'm going to get some brandy. +++$+++ 1990s
Jack. +++$+++ 1980s
Can't you? +++$+++ 1930s
Yes, sir. +++$+++ 1990s
For what? +++$+++ 1920s
You know. +++$+++ 1990s
Your what? +++$+++ 1990s
A doll? +++$+++ 1990s
Are you makin' fun of me --?  This is RIDICULOUS! +++$+++ 1990s
I understand.    I went to the Bar Association.  They tell me you're going to be disbarred. +++$+++ 1970s
Paisley Porter. +++$+++ 2000s
Tell me about them... +++$+++ 1990s
I don't care if you've got the Good Housekeeping seal of approval... I'm not looking for company. +++$+++ 1990s
I'd better go in. +++$+++ 1950s
Okay. +++$+++ 1950s
I'll make sure there's no kids left in the dorms... +++$+++ 1990s
It's my head, I'll be the judge of that. Anyway, who are you? +++$+++ 1980s
Yes, General. I am glad you came by. I overheard something that I think you should know about. +++$+++ 2000s
Any more ... +++$+++ 2000s
YOU'D fuck your uncle! +++$+++ 1990s
Yeah...I think they're just deciding what to do with us. +++$+++ 1980s
I love you dad. +++$+++ 1980s
You aren't staying? +++$+++ 1990s
That isn't true. +++$+++ 1990s
Diane 1. +++$+++ 2000s
I'm sure that ain't the only place he's sticking those pencils. +++$+++ 2000s
...using steroids.  I was a juicer. Diabonol, then, Wisterol -- it's for racehorses, for Christsake.  Now I'm bankrupt, divorced, my two grown kids won't return my calls... +++$+++ 1990s
That's new territory for us...but yes, we can look into that.  Explore shelter possibilities, funding bodies. we could - +++$+++ 1990s
Wait -- wait -- don't get up tight -- what I meant was we'd need a whole drum for that -- +++$+++ 1970s
Really -- you went with him for two years. +++$+++ 1980s
You better be, motherfucker. +++$+++ 1990s
What's that--detour? +++$+++ 1940s
No.  If you're smart, you run like hell. +++$+++ 1990s
You know where I'm from? +++$+++ 1990s
What time does the show go on? +++$+++ 1960s
The point is that she's upset. She's - and you got a fuckin' problem. +++$+++ 1990s
Is this 509-9027? +++$+++ 1990s
Splendid.  I'm actually in the stock- market, so not really similar fields, though I have done some amateur stuff -- P.G. Wodehouse, you know -- farce, all that.  'Ooh -- careful there, vicar.'  Always imagined it's a pretty tough job, though, acting. I mean the wages are a scandal, aren't they? +++$+++ 1990s
A magic dishcloth. +++$+++ 1980s
Can't you remember your own name? +++$+++ 2000s
One leg!  Like the Red Cross or something? +++$+++ 1990s
What about Neil? +++$+++ 1980s
More your line. +++$+++ 1990s
Look. That telegram was all scrambled. It was actually from Thompson, not to him. Western Union must have gotten the names reversed. I have to get going. I have to get out to the track. +++$+++ 1990s
Don't start. Look. +++$+++ 1960s
What do you want? +++$+++ 2000s
Well, Mr. Renton, I see that you attended the Royal Edinburgh College. +++$+++ 1990s
I have to leave now. +++$+++ 2000s
You scared me. +++$+++ 1990s
That's okay, that's okay, just shut the door. +++$+++ 1970s
Well that would be even better gossip. +++$+++ 1990s
So where are you now? +++$+++ 2000s
Yeah... +++$+++ 1970s
About two-thirty. +++$+++ 2000s
I can be real stiff. +++$+++ 1990s
Sorry. +++$+++ 1990s
Why don't he just tell 'em the truth? +++$+++ 2000s
She's got a juvenile record from New Orleans.  Parents died when she was 13. +++$+++ 2000s
What? +++$+++ 1990s
I was just looking at Carla's picture. +++$+++ 1950s
There was no plan! I was just young and stupid and scared! +++$+++ 2000s
So long, Colonel. +++$+++ 1970s
It's what he would have wanted, sir. +++$+++ 1990s
None at all? How about those 'underground' comics? +++$+++ 2000s
What are you then? +++$+++ 1960s
At the trial, you said you were at your apartment that night. Alone. +++$+++ 1980s
Don't crowd him. +++$+++ 2000s
He just did the Gettysburg Address in Sioux. What did he say? +++$+++ 1990s
Ever notice how cats always seem to turn up around dinner time? +++$+++ 1990s
Hiding. +++$+++ 1960s
You better watch your mouth, cunt, you're gonna get hurt. +++$+++ 2000s
Great.  Big ears, too? +++$+++ 1990s
Hey, no strings, right?  That's what you always said.  Just good pals who have the hots for each other. +++$+++ 1990s
Are you planning on working tomorrow? +++$+++ 1980s
Glad of it. +++$+++ 1990s
And that was only my first try. +++$+++ 1990s
It never ends. +++$+++ 1950s
You comin' in to hold my hand? +++$+++ 1970s
Yes you -- shut your mouth -- get out -- you're discharged. +++$+++ 1930s
Aye, that'll about do it. +++$+++ 2000s
Who? Some car hop, or a dress extra? +++$+++ 1950s
Thank you.  God bless you for helping us. +++$+++ 2000s
Sexual assault, Daryl.  Five years.  But you got lucky, right?  You got away with something else.  Something you figured nobody knows about. +++$+++ 2000s
You knew the arm slash was not "Zorro." +++$+++ 2000s
How should I know? "Solving a problem," I guess. Or needing to control everything. I don't know.  I've gotta get in there. +++$+++ 2000s
"Some prophet guy." And a city man. But he had to travel to the desert -- where there was quiet -- to hear the words of God. +++$+++ 2000s
The orbiting devices would be controlled from the point, then...? +++$+++ 1970s
Barnes believes in what he's doing. +++$+++ 1980s
Thanks for your help on the glasses thing. +++$+++ 1990s
--jeeeeeeeeesus-- +++$+++ 1970s
Toward the Pole! +++$+++ 1950s
Ah, the hair.  Blue, right? It's called Blue Ruin. The color. Snappy name, huh? +++$+++ 2000s
When I gave you my gun and you almost shot me. +++$+++ 1990s
How do you know he's dead? +++$+++ 1960s
So, do you enjoy being an actor? +++$+++ 1990s
No, you don't understand. It's here in these statues... +++$+++ 2000s
Please, the children. +++$+++ 2000s
Not unusual. +++$+++ 1970s
No, Doc, a private secret! It's perverted, it's pitiful. What am I -- Dr. Frankenstein? Aren't you repulsed? +++$+++ 1990s
Fine. +++$+++ 1990s
What time? +++$+++ 1980s
Very nice. What is it? +++$+++ 2000s
Yeah. He's knows of one all right. +++$+++ 2000s
Mama mia.  Just because you were a nerd once doesn't mean it's going to happen again. That's why you have me for fashion consultation. +++$+++ 1990s
Would you like a glass of tea or something? +++$+++ 1990s
Somethin' wrong with ya phone? Been callin' the last few days. +++$+++ 2000s
Do you want personal insights and adolescent secrets?  I don't do those. +++$+++ 1990s
Seventy-five. +++$+++ 1940s
Oh, there's no tellin' what that girl could've accomplished, and she never had it easy. Never really had a childhood... caring for her father, going to school. +++$+++ 2000s
Like how? +++$+++ 1990s
Look, I don't need to hear any of this working class hero crap. Some party boat skipper who's killed a few sharks... +++$+++ 1970s
It is kind of amazing. The dentist says she has perfect teeth, there isn't a cavity in her mouth. +++$+++ 1990s
Sandy, you have to chill out, at least two-thirds of the kids in our class are still virgins. He can't butcher all of us. +++$+++ 2000s
Say!  Do any of you guys know the Madison? +++$+++ 1970s
Yes. And tomorrow? I have a high maintenance selling painter coming through... So I'm out. Can you take him? +++$+++ 1990s
Yeah, we were just standing there. You said something about your shoulder hurting, then you just hit the ground like a sack of potatoes. +++$+++ 1990s
I did not get the report from an MI-6 agent. +++$+++ 1990s
Daya deo dono Dato.  Dalutan! +++$+++ 1990s
Oh? +++$+++ 2000s
What else did he tell you? +++$+++ 1940s
Do you understand why I came here? +++$+++ 1970s
Bob! I think I hear motors! +++$+++ 1930s
Hello? +++$+++ 1940s
Ally.  That's right. +++$+++ 1990s
You can't do this!  You owe me, O'Brien.  I made you plastic!  I made you! +++$+++ 1990s
Where are you going? +++$+++ 1970s
You want to be like that, Swann? Mud and shit? +++$+++ 1990s
Anything at all. I presume you won’t want to take the boy with you when you’re finished?  There’s a £500 fee for disposal. The boy is yours, you understand? +++$+++ 1990s
Bollocks, I’m sorry. I had no idea this would be so difficult. +++$+++ 2000s
Zeke. +++$+++ 2000s
Must be a garrison in town. We're in occupied territory, boys. +++$+++ 2000s
She was the one-- +++$+++ 1990s
There are complications. +++$+++ 1990s
See that tram coming around the corner? +++$+++ 2000s
It was. What sadness lengthens Romeo's hours?" +++$+++ 1990s
Don't count it. +++$+++ 1990s
Good. +++$+++ 1990s
He spoke to me. You want me to dis him? +++$+++ 2000s
It's OK.   It's good to let it out. +++$+++ 2000s
Just what the hell is wrong with you? +++$+++ 1990s
Great. Grab his feet. We'll throw him in the trunk. +++$+++ 2000s
July fourth weekend. Storm season starts today. The clouds roll in like clockwork. +++$+++ 1990s
Booo! +++$+++ 1990s
Man, I ain't ready to be goin' out nowhere -- +++$+++ 1990s
Fletcher, get away from there... +++$+++ 1990s
MPH RMPH RMPH RMPH RM!!! +++$+++ 1990s
I know, like five chickens had to die just so she could look that stupid. +++$+++ 1990s
You're looking magnificent, Leon...  ...isn't he, General Savitzky? +++$+++ 1930s
What the hell can I do? +++$+++ 1980s
You said it! +++$+++ 1930s
I can't believe you're doing this. +++$+++ 1990s
Are, too. +++$+++ 2000s
What's happened?  Kip!  What's happening? Don't shoot, please, don't shoot anybody. +++$+++ 1990s
His dream?  You can't control your dreams.  And you can't control your fears, can you? +++$+++ 1990s
No further questions. +++$+++ 1990s
All right, then. No more interruptions.  ... at noon, she met her subjects again. This time as their Queen. +++$+++ 1980s
No, no, what, what is it? +++$+++ 1990s
Das mussen sie doch wissen. Ich meine ohne grund wird die politzei doch nicht ins Hans komme Fraulein Schmidt, ein schande... +++$+++ 1940s
Then just help me find a girlfriend! That's all I ask. I'll give you every single card I've got left! +++$+++ 1990s
I've done the slut thing, David. It's really kinda old. +++$+++ 1990s
You! Activate circuits 29 through W7 and start Full Power Coordinates on Exterior Defensive Systems: +++$+++ 1980s
It's a romantic and tragic drink. +++$+++ 1980s
In private.  They got cameras and alla that crap in there. Microphones. +++$+++ 1990s
Al ???!!! +++$+++ 1980s
Maybe, but if you didn't I think you would have kept on walking. +++$+++ 1990s
Lava's hateable.  I never thought of that. +++$+++ 1990s
It's not the structure but the spirit which dwells within. There are three rooms and a kitchenette dedicated to hospitality. +++$+++ 1930s
I do the research. +++$+++ 1950s
Bite his ear! +++$+++ 2000s
Supposing he wants to get bad with us? +++$+++ 2000s
Well, she was a little upset at first, and that's why I thought you ought to hold your peace when you talked to your people last night...you did, didn't you, Louis? +++$+++ 1980s
The Kommandant also sends you clean blankets. He wants every man to have a new, clean blanket. +++$+++ 1950s
No, Sir. +++$+++ 1990s
How come ... ? +++$+++ 2000s
No you guys... Something happened... You guys wanna hear something creepy?  I don't think Kenny is dead. +++$+++ 1990s
No.  Look, we're kind of.... +++$+++ 1970s
Wha -- +++$+++ 1990s
Tell me about von der Null. +++$+++ 2000s
Write what you want. Just try not to make it so obvious that you're crazy about me. +++$+++ 2000s
Not everyone can have X-ray vision, you know. +++$+++ 1980s
Bad dreams? +++$+++ 1990s
Oh, it was...  ... Most of the time. +++$+++ 2000s
Jesus Christ is coming back and he's really pissed. +++$+++ 1970s
I don't know now. You-you wanna go to another movie?  So let's go see The Sorrow and the Pity. +++$+++ 1970s
No.  I don't think so. +++$+++ 1970s
I don't think we have anything to talk about. +++$+++ 1970s
We're on our way home. I just...we're running a little late. +++$+++ 1990s
I'm sorry, I'm not a weaver! +++$+++ 1990s
Is that what her daddy tells her? +++$+++ 1990s
We don't know. +++$+++ 2000s
It's . . . it's locked. +++$+++ 1970s
Wait up there, Claude. You give that guy your corn bread and the next thing you know you'll be ironing his shirts and clipping his toenails. +++$+++ 2000s
Hi. Hi Sandy. I'm sorry to bother you, but I've got to talk to you. +++$+++ 1980s
You are the Princess. +++$+++ 1990s
Yes - now let's see - where do you suppose the steward set it up? +++$+++ 1950s
--the crest of a lion and a dragon and a single word:  Courage. +++$+++ 1990s
How about me?  Do you think if I concentrated and put my whole soul into it, that some day I might be a putterer? +++$+++ 1930s
Mom, please don't start that again.... +++$+++ 1980s
Fantastic.  The Girlfriend Lottery. +++$+++ 2000s
Yours not to reason why, Miss Teschmacher. Relax! Enjoy it!  Just look at that smog! +++$+++ 1970s
What did I say? +++$+++ 1980s
Your hair looks so cute like that. +++$+++ 2000s
Boys just passing through? +++$+++ 1960s
Well, I got up one morning and went to work... just like any other day, except it was my first since hearing about the baby. And, I... I felt this fear and anxiety washing over me.  I looked around, and I thought, how can we raise a child surrounded by all this?  How can a child grow up here?  So, that night, I told her I didn't want us to have it, and over the next few weeks, I convinced her it was wrong.  I mean... I wore her down, slowly. +++$+++ 1970s
I've got you floored... We're off ... Take the curb... Man, can you corner... Know not to get on it ... Momentum shift ... Don't get on those brakes too hard ... Get her up on her tires. Up on her toes. Up ... Up... Up. +++$+++ 2000s
Like all living beings, Admiral each according to his gifts. The ship is yours. +++$+++ 1980s
Gee. You shouldn't take it so seriously, Jean. That's why you can't stop taking drugs. You always think people don't like you. Everyone likes you. +++$+++ 1990s
Almost. I figure we should find us a place to stay and then go eat. +++$+++ 1990s
I'll tell you another thing.  We might have led the world once into the Industrial Revolution, now we lead with television commercials. We're the best, it's as simple as that.  Even the Americans will admit it now ... the camera work, the acting, the scripts, special effects.  We've got the lot.  Nearly all the good directors here have ambitions to make serious films.  That food you're eating. +++$+++ 1980s
You're crazy to let go of a chick who calls you Lotte. I tell you that as a friend. +++$+++ 1990s
What're we going to do?! +++$+++ 1980s
I thought you were going to join us. Jesus, Garland, you left me alone with those people. +++$+++ 1990s
I want children, I want a family. But I don't know when. +++$+++ 1970s
... his snoring, yeah.  He says it's worse than ever.  That snaffle one...? +++$+++ 1990s
I had no thought of offending you, Oona. +++$+++ 1980s
You think Freeze will take the bait? +++$+++ 1940s
Yes I do. +++$+++ 2000s
Look at these people behind you. I'm totally convinced they're Satanists. +++$+++ 2000s
What...?  <u>Oh</u>. +++$+++ 1990s
Blackjack, Nick, blackjack I am good at. I mean, they'd give us some free games or something, wouldn't they? Since you worked there? +++$+++ 2000s
We can keep it in the bathroom. +++$+++ 1990s
What do you mean we. +++$+++ 1980s
Who is he? +++$+++ 1970s
I sure remember Tommy.  Mind if we talked about something else? +++$+++ 1980s
Get into business with this crew, identify them.  Illuminate their network.  If you're lucky, discover their source, how they penetrated us.  We'll indict and take it from there... +++$+++ 2000s
I'm glad you have such confidence in me. +++$+++ 1990s
There's Peggy with Michael Fitzsimmons. +++$+++ 1980s
So that the Old Mill, the Old <u>Mill</u> represents...the wheel of fate is that too... +++$+++ 2000s
Not that I'm glad you were sick, but I had a chance to do some thinking last night. +++$+++ 1980s
Yes. +++$+++ 1990s
What? +++$+++ 1980s
I was wondering. +++$+++ 2000s
You see what I see, Bork? +++$+++ 1990s
I've got eight hundred pounds. Oh Jesus. +++$+++ 2000s
See if they make sense.  To begin with, I think you should throw out all that psychological stuff -- exploring a killer's sick mind. +++$+++ 1950s
For Christ's sake, why not? +++$+++ 1990s
Troughed off. Protected. Like, you know, like he got a moat around it. +++$+++ 2000s
Gee! That musta been terrible.  I guess he had it coming to him though. But don't you worry about me. I don't talk. I never talk. Take my word for it. Gee, I wouldn't want anything to happen to my kids. +++$+++ 1930s
Hey... you got a minute? Hey. He's got two million in the box, am I right?  Okay, you let him keep your jewels. We take the cash and the only other thing he cares about.  Huh?  Her majesty. We go to Europe. You dye your hair, get some pl- +++$+++ 1990s
What are we going to do! +++$+++ 2000s
Not really. They just said it might be because we trained at Houston and they trained in Marshall, and that we're being charged against differ- ent accounting offices. +++$+++ 1960s
They were safe and could sleep. +++$+++ 1990s
No. +++$+++ 1930s
Aye.  And it is the trouble befallen us that brings me here.  I entreat you to tell me the cause of our surrounding sorrow, most lovely of the lovely. +++$+++ 1980s
Are you sure? +++$+++ 1990s
Those aren't guards.  They're valets. +++$+++ 1990s
They want to dump Tiger and have me endorse their damned chariot, right? They don't waste time... +++$+++ 2000s
That's better, but you've still got a long way to go.  Talk to Reiben, he's a natural and works at it, he'll give you some pointers. +++$+++ 1990s
I liked the bit you did about Baltic chastity belts. Too bad no one else did. +++$+++ 1980s
You don't understand! It's her father... +++$+++ 1990s
Hold on a sec.  Lois, you sure you wouldn't rather do this in the morning? +++$+++ 1990s
But he does seem familiar? +++$+++ 1980s
Aren't you worried you could die a virgin? +++$+++ 2000s
Give it back? Are you nuts? +++$+++ 2000s
Why should I? We're happy, aren't we, darling? +++$+++ 1930s
Shit. You're not planning -- +++$+++ 1990s
Why are you doing this to me? I'll give you whatever... +++$+++ 1980s
You can't believe how much he's improved. +++$+++ 1990s
Dark Valdez. +++$+++ 1970s
Nothing.  That's all I can say. +++$+++ 1990s
You can see the outline of a butt. +++$+++ 2000s
I guess what I mean is, my mother married my dad after you...and then I was born, so I thought that...maybe you got divorced because of me. +++$+++ 1990s
I'm going to make this Ms. Pauline thing work. Lines of communication between the cliques. You were a phase.... +++$+++ 1980s
What? +++$+++ 1970s
How do you know she is a witch? +++$+++ 1970s
Sure. Hey, but the biggest thing I didn't tell you . . . +++$+++ 1940s
When I came upstairs, you stayed to finish your drink. I told you to turn off the TV when you were through.  Come to think of it, I also told you you could sleep in the maid's room. +++$+++ 1990s
Please hurry. +++$+++ 1980s
Okay. Make me an isosceles. +++$+++ 2000s
Joanna said that? +++$+++ 1970s
I'm game.  Sure. +++$+++ 1990s
Oh no!  We can't fight this thing! There's only six hours of air left -- we're dead men! +++$+++ 1970s
Trade Re1ations. +++$+++ 1990s
Well, this might come in handy. +++$+++ 1940s
You're a very intelligent girl, Tracy. You have many admirable qualities.  But someday maybe you'll learn that being smart and always being on top and doing whatever you need to do to get ahead, and yes, stepping on people to get there, well, there's a lot more to life than that.  And in the end, you're only cheating yourself. +++$+++ 1990s
Ah, ya know.  Neighborhood's not what it used to be.  Kid no more'n five swiped a candy bar the other day. +++$+++ 2000s
Wait a second Sid. Don't you go jumping the gun. You haven't seen the best part.  With the aides of the computer revolution of y2kI've been able to steal your voice.  Ain't it cool? Listen to what the police are gonna find next to your lifeless, mutilated body. +++$+++ 2000s
Oh, perfect!  He reminds me of Ichabod Crane.  His Adam's apple keeps jumping up and down whenever he gets excited. HANNAH  Listen.  He's a lot better than your ex-husband.  He's got a good job.  Would you light those, please? He's-he's-he's not a dope addict or anything. +++$+++ 1980s
What do you mean?  You gambled it? +++$+++ 1990s
"Dad." +++$+++ 1990s
Uh, ninety days. And now I just have to go once a week. See, I'm rehabilitated. +++$+++ 1990s
My clothes have always been perfectly serviceable. +++$+++ 1990s
But how are we gonna -- +++$+++ 1980s
I don't know, the attorney gen... the...some consumer office, um... +++$+++ 1990s
Free-lance?  Oh really?  You think I don't see?  You think I took vows yesterday?  I know what you're up to. You and Reverend Mother. +++$+++ 1990s
Gee, Eddie, I'm a rabbit.  We always run. +++$+++ 1980s
Where you going? +++$+++ 1950s
I know.  It sucks.  I suck. +++$+++ 1990s
What are the doctors saying? +++$+++ 2000s
What's the matter?  What's the matter with you?  You look pale.  You okay? +++$+++ 1980s
Later. +++$+++ 1980s
But, we had requested -- we were hoping to take her back to Genesis... +++$+++ 1980s
We felt his presence. +++$+++ 1980s
Tommy.  Come on. Relax. +++$+++ 1990s
Is it familiar? Have you been here before. +++$+++ 1980s
Donna, are you my best friend? +++$+++ 1990s
That would give us only three seconds to revive him... +++$+++ 1960s
What? +++$+++ 1990s
And co. A lot of co. Oh, God, I've thought about you so much. +++$+++ 1990s
It's a good one all right. +++$+++ 2000s
What makes you so sure he's the one? +++$+++ 1980s
Do you want something to drink? +++$+++ 2000s
That's it, man.  That's the whole story. +++$+++ 1990s
I deduced it. Once you walked in. +++$+++ 2000s
Okay. +++$+++ 1950s
What's going on? +++$+++ 2000s
Yeah, thanks for everything. +++$+++ 1980s
But it didn't stop. I know it didn't stop. Granny told me it didn't. +++$+++ 2000s
Tiger's challenged you and Jerses has made me an offer, made us both an offer:  you take a fall. +++$+++ 2000s
Yeah. +++$+++ 1980s
That's in Maverick County. +++$+++ 1990s
Yeah. +++$+++ 1980s
Maybe, yeah.  Hell, I don't know. +++$+++ 1990s
On what charge? +++$+++ 2000s
B:  Ryan is dead.  He's been blown up by the German equivalent of Wade, whose name I know you don't want me to mention.  There's nothing to find. The biggest piece is the size of a pea.  We wander around, looking for him until the Germans pick us off, one after another. +++$+++ 1990s
So you have the answers... +++$+++ 1990s
I guess not Cooper... +++$+++ 2000s
What's on the call sheet? +++$+++ 1990s
Try a year and a half. He bands her an old snapshot. PILAR looks at it-- +++$+++ 1990s
Wow... +++$+++ 1990s
How do I know that? How about it, pretzel-man? What's your story? +++$+++ 1990s
No oxygen to the brain. +++$+++ 2000s
Why'd they break off?  Was there water in that canyon? +++$+++ 1950s
Class of eighty-six!  I didn't know you were there. +++$+++ 2000s
Okay. +++$+++ 1990s
How many were there? +++$+++ 1990s
Yes. Uh, how will we recognize this Doctor Schneider when we see him? +++$+++ 1980s
No!  Tis not the time!  I want no part of your frolic. +++$+++ 1980s
Whoa.  No shit. +++$+++ 2000s
I pose an unacceptable danger to the public, remember? +++$+++ 1990s
I believe the beverage has provoked an emotional response. +++$+++ 1990s
It's like jelly. +++$+++ 1990s
I do know.  Be two places at once... learn to hit a baseball or turn a cartwheel... eat breakfast with chopsticks... +++$+++ 2000s
Ease off, John .. +++$+++ 1990s
Half the time he's bluffing. +++$+++ 1980s

Blood . . . my . . . blood . . . +++$+++ 1980s
He has a big mouth.  Yes!  It seems to me I did read something about that incident as a student.  But you have to remember that a worm -- with very few exceptions -- is not a human being. +++$+++ 1970s
Don't strain yourself. +++$+++ 1980s
I was fired by Wyant Wheeler. I plan to bring a wrongful termination suit against Charles Wheeler and his partners. +++$+++ 1990s
Gotta find me first, you pansy-assed Mama's boy. +++$+++ 1990s
Buzz has been moving the cash out in hollow bowling pins. Sid and Breeze throw sideways glances at each other. +++$+++ 1990s
Everyone else was wrong and the one fucking lunatic was right! +++$+++ 1980s
Andrew hardly needed leading.  He was a very passionate man.  He was eager to explore.  I gave him what he wanted.  We fulfilled each others needs. +++$+++ 1990s
Yes, sir. Rubinstein takes out a notebook. +++$+++ 1970s
What about rule number three: Don't get involved with dispatchers named Love. +++$+++ 1990s
-- watch the mouth, homeboy, I don't need to hear that word -- +++$+++ 1990s
I can't work this. +++$+++ 1990s
I have... eight-fifteen. That's not right, is it? +++$+++ 2000s
I didn't know you were so kinky. +++$+++ 1990s
Not mad. +++$+++ 2000s
Yes, absolutely. Is there a ballet in Figaro? +++$+++ 1980s
Directory enquiries. Can I help you? +++$+++ 1990s
I know it, son. But tonight's going to be even tougher. +++$+++ 1970s
What... does he... look like? +++$+++ 2000s
We drugged her.  So she wouldn't remember. +++$+++ 1920s
Where is she? +++$+++ 2000s
See here, child, when you have this pain in your back, where is it? +++$+++ 1940s
Looks like weather. +++$+++ 1990s
Thank you, Kenny. +++$+++ 1990s
Ruth's already taken him home. +++$+++ 2000s
Huh? +++$+++ 1990s
Exactly!  We've got to take the war to them.  Hit 'em where it hurts -- right in the nuts.  More assassinations, more killings.  Right, Al? +++$+++ 1990s
It's all, gone wrong, nothing's working out. +++$+++ 1980s
He's doing the same thing you did to him, playing Letterman on TV. +++$+++ 1990s
What do you mean?  What happened! +++$+++ 1990s
OH.  "I'm a Yankee Doodle Dandy, Yankee Doodle is my ... " Listen, this is not place to talk.  Come! +++$+++ 1960s
They're in 7D. +++$+++ 1990s
Yeah +++$+++ 1990s
Oh! +++$+++ 1930s
What?  We both have cars. +++$+++ 1990s
We go underwater? +++$+++ 1990s
Good night, Steve. +++$+++ 1940s
Does he have to stay here over night? +++$+++ 1990s
Did you knock on the door yet? +++$+++ 1990s
Like if something happened to him, he could still get us. +++$+++ 1990s
You thought wrong. I haven’t seen Leon for months. +++$+++ 1990s
Yes, sir. +++$+++ 1930s
What do your friends call you?-- The ones that know you well?--and like you very much? +++$+++ 1990s
It was blown up with the plane. +++$+++ 1990s
How 'bout the tree? You want the tree? +++$+++ 2000s
You think this is the guy who did it? +++$+++ 1980s
They killed her.  And they're trying to buy it... +++$+++ 1970s
Do you ever get like the slightest inkling that you might want to help me instead of doing absolutely nothing? +++$+++ 2000s
Norman Cay is not a person.  He is an island, George.  In the Bahamas.  From what they say, it is free and it's Diego's new home. +++$+++ 2000s
I think I'm gonna have a fucking heart attack. +++$+++ 2000s
And what would this be, Sweet and Low? +++$+++ 1990s
I don't even know why I'm afraid, Uncle Charles. I can't even remember when it started. Don't you think it's time I found out and got over it? +++$+++ 1980s
...the Suitcase Bomb.  ACT ONE Albania denies it. President comes on the air, "Be Calm."  Okay, now: Good.  Now, Alright.  Act <u>TWO</u>...  I need the following here.  Right now:  Johnnie Green, Liz Butsky, and get me the Fad King. +++$+++ 1990s
Oh Christ. Julia... +++$+++ 1980s
A Jedi's power is measured by the amount of the Force that is stored within him, and I have little of the Force left in me. +++$+++ 1970s
"60 Minutes," the television show? +++$+++ 1990s
Hurry, Sister! +++$+++ 1990s
Look at it this way, it's their contribution. If we'd explained it to them, they'd probably have given it to us anyway. +++$+++ 2000s
Yes, this is Doctor Marrow. +++$+++ 1990s
I know it's you, Grady, I just... Christ, Grady, do you know what time it is? +++$+++ 2000s
You're so far off!  Hal... Hal Sinclair... your co- star.  Remember now?... No, I don't think he's put on weight.  Anyway, you think he's right for "Eternity Forever"?... not the right type?... a different direction...  I'll try to talk her into it. +++$+++ 2010s
Water? +++$+++ 1990s
My office will fill him in and help expedite.  Look forward to meeting you at the proper time.  Jumping off now... +++$+++ 1990s

Well, he's succeeded in impressing half the world. +++$+++ 1940s
... is that I sent them here. I told them she came here sometimes. With her dirtball boyfriend. That's exactly what I said. +++$+++ 2000s
Actually, I had a crash course from my mother the night before my prom. +++$+++ 1980s
How much? +++$+++ 1990s
Tell her you need to see her. +++$+++ 1990s
All of it. +++$+++ 1970s
Sure. +++$+++ 1990s
Sure will, pal, sure will. +++$+++ 1990s
Goddam right. +++$+++ 1980s
He was hot, wasn't he? +++$+++ 1980s
The guy was history when he killed Kelly.  You knew that. +++$+++ 1990s
Smile, little sister, smile. +++$+++ 1980s
Wendy... How would you like to go get some ice cream? +++$+++ 1990s
Um--hello? You want to like take a look? +++$+++ 1990s
Who is this guy, anyway? +++$+++ 2000s
I'm for that. +++$+++ 2000s
Okay... +++$+++ 1990s
Your father is Julian Cross, isn't he? +++$+++ 1970s
I'll always go back to that church. +++$+++ 1990s
I am not!  I'm a terrible mother! I'm an awful mother.  I yell at him all the time.  I have no patience.  No...No.  He's better off without me.  Ted, I've got to go...I've got to go. +++$+++ 1970s
What are you asking me? +++$+++ 2000s
What does it mean? +++$+++ 2000s
It's a miracle. +++$+++ 1980s
What? +++$+++ 1990s
Hey look.  You think I'm gonna run out on ya or somethin'?  Just cause we hit it big.  Luther, I owe you everything.  If you hadn't taught me con, I wouldn't know nothin'. +++$+++ 1970s
There always are.  But there are also three men and three guns. Matched forensically.  A few loose ends don't matter. +++$+++ 1990s
Sustained. +++$+++ 2000s
God, I haven't seen you all day. +++$+++ 1990s
Ok, well, travel safely. See you soon. +++$+++ 2000s
Meet me at 4:01, top of the run. That'll give you a minute to freshen up. +++$+++ 2000s
Yes. +++$+++ 2000s
Yes. But my boss reckons you’d still be better off as a limited company. For expenses and all that, you know? It’d cost you about £100 but he said it’d be worth it.  Of course, you’d need a partner to register. But that’s a formality. I mean, I could be your partner. I mean, just as a name, right? +++$+++ 1990s
"...especially Spencer's Theorem..." +++$+++ 2000s
You're sure?  There was nothing? +++$+++ 2000s
I'll tell you how come.  The Barrack Chief gave them the green light. And you, our Security Officer, said it'd be safe. That's how come. +++$+++ 1950s
Sure I'm insane, but I've got some good news for you.  This magnolia is leaving your sweet smelling vanilla joint. This bird in a cage is gonna button his own pants from now on. And that is what is known as telling the mother- in-law. +++$+++ 1930s
Okay. He's driving along and this fuckin' cat jumps in front of his car, and so he hits this cat-- +++$+++ 1990s
I understand sir.  Could you slide your shorts down please? +++$+++ 1990s
Damn skippy. He like it, too. +++$+++ 1990s
But what? +++$+++ 1970s
Time out. +++$+++ 1990s
Yes, I do. +++$+++ 1970s
You heard voices, you know you did. +++$+++ 2000s
Hal will have my head for this. +++$+++ 1990s
Good. Good. Do not let Vig out of your sight. +++$+++ 2000s
I mean, listen, two people don't get along, at some point you gotta call it... I mean, it's none of my business, but I ... I think that's what you gotta do. You gotta take it somewhere - +++$+++ 1990s
I bribed the Minister of Health to have you transferred to Kigali. +++$+++ 2000s
Good.  So shall we leave it at that then? +++$+++ 2000s
But what did he see that made him panic? +++$+++ 1980s
Just do it. +++$+++ 2000s
That's me. +++$+++ 1990s
Like it were a piano? +++$+++ 1990s
Not a lot of difference. +++$+++ 1990s
Oh God Veronica, my afterlife is s-o-o boring. If I have to sing "Kumbaya" one more time... +++$+++ 1980s
When? +++$+++ 1980s
He divorced his wife -- he married Marylin -- he divorced Marylin -- and he -- remarried his WIFE? What kind of sick -- +++$+++ 2000s
He's a lucky man.  Do I know him? +++$+++ 1990s
Trust is something you earn, over time. You don't just inherit it overnight like a gazillion dollar empire. +++$+++ 2000s
Yes.  Don't hurt me. +++$+++ 1980s
Well you guess what.  The Mayor sent me. I have your Mr. Barrenger with a history of... +++$+++ 2000s
We have some unfinished business. +++$+++ 1980s
You'd drifted right through the core systems.  It's blind luck that deep-salvage team caught you when they...are you all right? +++$+++ 1980s
That you left? or that you didn't say 'goodbye'? +++$+++ 1970s
Before he can get there here comes this Federal Marshal, and Franky's indicted for Jury tampering, they throw him in jail, he's gonna be disbarred, his life is over.   Jimmy, gimme another drink.    How are you? +++$+++ 1970s
Hello, Neo. +++$+++ 1990s
She's <u>dying</u> and <u>Rache</u> is your mother now! +++$+++ 1990s
This is the right day. +++$+++ 1950s
Yes. +++$+++ 1980s
Since when did you drink diet soda? +++$+++ 1990s
I don't want to go that way.  Find a way that we don't have to go through Texas. +++$+++ 1990s
Okay...don't forget to get another therapist for next week. +++$+++ 1990s
Hey, tabloids paid Ted Bundy - famous serial killer - half a million for his interview.  And how much you think Monica got for writing book about the President coming on to her?  It pays to be a killer or a whore in this country. Look, you want magazine or not? +++$+++ 2000s
Fine.  Have them do some. +++$+++ 1980s
My Lord, enemy commander wishes a truce to confer. +++$+++ 1980s
A single hour. +++$+++ 1970s
Oh, no! She hasn't been here at all! I would have seen her, you know. I've been right here all the time, putting olive oil on my rubber plant leaves! +++$+++ 1950s
I'm crucifying him. +++$+++ 1930s
What happened? +++$+++ 1980s
I don't know why she bought me a tie! -- She's a generous person -- and she's a nice person -- and I could be settin' her up to be killed... you want the fuckin' tie? +++$+++ 1980s
No. +++$+++ 1980s
Oh, man! +++$+++ 1990s
What'd I tell you? +++$+++ 1980s
I hit him from the floor with everything I knew! +++$+++ 1930s
I mean, I don't know, he's seeing someone else or something, but... +++$+++ 1980s
Somebody better tell me what's going on and tell me fast! I can take so much and then... +++$+++ 1960s
Think you can narrow it down for me. +++$+++ 2000s
Four minutes. +++$+++ 1990s
Right here, Mom... +++$+++ 1990s
Who, for instance? +++$+++ 1930s
Ahm.  That thing I was doing tonight -- I'm not doing it any more.  I told them I had to spend the evening with Britain's premier equestrian journalist. +++$+++ 1990s
Boy, don't you hate it when that happens? +++$+++ 1990s
No, no, I-I-i, uh, I don't use any major hallucinogenics because I took a puff like five years ago at a party and +++$+++ 1970s
Oops! Time for class. Meet me after? On the benches? +++$+++ 2000s
It isn't safe for you to remain in this area. +++$+++ 1990s
No -- +++$+++ 1990s
We'll bring them up just like we brought you. It's called a transporter beam... +++$+++ 1980s
What's wrong with your hand? +++$+++ 1990s
We take a weeny little wedge, bang on it a couple of times, and bust off a chunk of the metal.  Yet any spacecraft -- even at a low velocity, say 200 miles an hour -- crashes into the water -- it's gonna be like hitting concrete, it would crumple like paper.  But there isn't a dent to be seen anywhere.  Not even a scratch. +++$+++ 1990s
-- Price killed her, there's no other explanation -- +++$+++ 1990s
Where is the little lady? +++$+++ 1990s
A recoil, with no compensating mechanism. +++$+++ 2000s
I'm going with the patrol boat to make a tour around the islands. +++$+++ 1960s
HELLLPPP! +++$+++ 2000s
You were wrong, it did hurt. +++$+++ 1970s
Look are you just fiddling around with me or what? +++$+++ 1980s
I mean do you feel like telling me what were the circumstances? +++$+++ 1960s
What's the matter? +++$+++ 1940s
You seem to have an answer for everything. +++$+++ 1990s
Jasper Lamar Crabb? +++$+++ 1970s
I cannot tell a lie. +++$+++ 1980s
The Farpoint mission? Data, that was seven years ago. +++$+++ 1990s
Don't kill me. Oh shit, please no. I'm Rocco. I'm the funny man!... the funny man... the funny. +++$+++ 1990s
Think I should put the skateboard in bed with him? +++$+++ 1980s
Yes. +++$+++ 1990s
I hope so. Is that the end then? +++$+++ 1970s
Pleasure. +++$+++ 1990s
You'd better try to get some sleep, Bob. +++$+++ 1930s
Ha ha ha! +++$+++ 1990s
Yes.  Fine. +++$+++ 2000s
Yeah, Boss? +++$+++ 1940s
V'ger travels to the third planet to find the Creator. +++$+++ 1970s
Joe, don't do this -- +++$+++ 1990s
Eighty cents a word--three--six--nine words. That'll be seven twenty, but it's too much--I'll show you how to save some money. +++$+++ 1930s
What about Fleur-de-Lis?  Their slogan's 'Whatever you desire.' +++$+++ 1990s
Excuse me... +++$+++ 1990s
Jani! Where are you? +++$+++ 1990s
Now you've fallen into his trap. When he goes to bed at night Burgel dreams of inspiring as much fear in others as they inspire in him. +++$+++ 1990s
-- I guess you haven't. +++$+++ 1990s
Don't give me that preoccupied scientist crap.  I'm trying to get ready for.... +++$+++ 1980s
Walter-- +++$+++ 1990s
I'm not a lonely spooky writer like you. Nursing a hundred grudges. I'm a man who loves life. +++$+++ 2000s
Hi--!  The gun was empty! +++$+++ 1990s
No argument. +++$+++ 1980s
Mmm.Hmmm. +++$+++ 1990s
Tell your mother. +++$+++ 1990s
I hope so, too. +++$+++ 1940s
I'm really tired, Dad... can I just go to sleep? +++$+++ 1990s
I tried to grab you -- save you -- +++$+++ 1990s
Yeah. +++$+++ 1990s
No baby.  I'm serious.  Cancel that meeting.  I got more fruit that needs checking.  Come home with me now. +++$+++ 2000s
It's too late... We already tested it on Organa Major.  It appears your data never got through. +++$+++ 1970s
Come on speak up, Gooding, I'm trying to run a business here. I can't have people flipping out in the break room when they should be slaving away at their desks. +++$+++ 2000s
How'do. +++$+++ 1950s
Solid rocket fuel at twenty-five thousand kilograms... +++$+++ 1990s
Oh darling -- is that for me? +++$+++ 1990s
I thought maybe you just came for the ride. +++$+++ 1990s
What are we doing here? +++$+++ 1990s
How come that's all you talk about anymore ? +++$+++ 1990s
It's sinking, Harold. Going over the horizon - where we are all going to go. It's getting dark. "Let each man hold on to his candle and get a light where'er he can." +++$+++ 1970s
But I might not have. +++$+++ 2000s
I said keep your nose out of my life. No kid is going to tell me how to run it. +++$+++ 1940s
Yes. +++$+++ 2000s
In the back...feels like an arrowhead. +++$+++ 1960s
Because I think you're writing on spec and with a first person interview, you might actually sell that thing. +++$+++ 1990s
The Torah says not to light a fire on the Sabbath, because it's work, correct?  But if alternating current's running through the wires every second of every day, and I throw a switch, send it here instead of there, how is that lighting a fire? +++$+++ 2000s
You know, when you dumped me for that wimp, I thought, Cole, she'll be back. God wants the two of you to be together, and sure enough... +++$+++ 1980s
He certainly could. About a month. +++$+++ 1940s
It's PG&E saying to the judge that we don't have a case.  Their lawyers go -- +++$+++ 2000s
You want to bet? +++$+++ 1990s
Looks like he planned, something. He shut up his apartment and his shop. +++$+++ 1930s
Psst! Hey, Martini, wake up! +++$+++ 1970s
Oh, Kyle. +++$+++ 1980s
Shh.  It's okay. +++$+++ 2000s
That's right. +++$+++ 1960s
We don't know of anything, Master... +++$+++ 1960s
Will the Senator yield for a question? +++$+++ 1930s
I guess living up here makes people look older. +++$+++ 1990s
turns around and Juliet presents her with a brown paper bag. +++$+++ 1990s
No. +++$+++ 1990s
Maybe six months with good behavior.  One to five. +++$+++ 1970s
It is possible the French authorities will find a reason to put him in the concentration camp here. +++$+++ 1940s
Todd, if you're gonna make it around here, you've gotta speak up.  The meek might inherit the earth but they don't get into Harvard. know what I mean? +++$+++ 1980s
Oh no.  Look -- I like you. I wouldn't keep coming here if I didn't like you. +++$+++ 1960s
I am not mad. +++$+++ 1930s
They'll shoot you, Animal! +++$+++ 1950s
He's your brother, you figure it out.  Maybe he made another bomb. +++$+++ 1990s
If I had to guess by your eyes, I'd say you were fifty. +++$+++ 1990s
Didn't know I needed a reason to come home. +++$+++ 2000s
Wrong. That is flat out wrong. Hell is for cowards, for hypocrites who fear to live by the strenght of their own convictions. This is war. Given the circumstances, and given the fact that we are alive and they are not, we have chosen life over death. Two wrongs don't make a right. So our conviction and execution would only mean more death here, not less. +++$+++ 1990s
We were called in by the Jerome base... +++$+++ 1990s
No we don't. +++$+++ 1960s
Frank would open you. +++$+++ 1990s
This must be some important boat. +++$+++ 2000s
I'll show you the cabin. +++$+++ 1960s
Because... +++$+++ 1990s
Can I look for myself? +++$+++ 2000s
Then, I need you.  We all do. Without your victory the men would have no hope at all. +++$+++ 2000s
Were <i>you</i> alone? +++$+++ 1990s
Honors -- hup! +++$+++ 1980s
The reason why I wanted to take a walk, Mary, is 'cause I wanted to talk to you. +++$+++ 1930s
Where's Regan's father? +++$+++ 1970s
Oh no; quite the contrary. He's really just a child. +++$+++ 1960s
I go home and paint the kitchen. +++$+++ 1990s
It's oregano.  You got ripped off, pal. What are you gonna do with all this? +++$+++ 2000s
And you missed this?  How are you going to miss something like this? +++$+++ 1990s
We just have to make a new beginning. +++$+++ 2000s
Yeah.  I'm not trying to replace your Dad... or steal your Mom.  I just want to be your friend. +++$+++ 1980s
You don't understand. +++$+++ 1990s
Who? +++$+++ 1990s
That happens to be the truth. +++$+++ 1930s
Oh.  Congratulations. +++$+++ 1990s
Nova, yeah she looked pretty sweet. +++$+++ 2000s
Because mother read it in a book somewhere, and if mother's little darling doesn't take her fingers out of the salad bowl this instant, mother's going to wring her little neck. +++$+++ 1930s
But I won't. +++$+++ 1960s
But I don't want to go, I am enjoying it. +++$+++ 2000s
I'm Taryn White.  I only came here because it was a better deal than juvie hall.  Also, I guess 'cause I'm going through some very stange shit. +++$+++ 1980s
Yeah, thanks. +++$+++ 1990s
I don't know. +++$+++ 2000s
No other aspiration? +++$+++ 1990s
-- I guess I just blocked it out, that's all. +++$+++ 1970s
And my passport? +++$+++ 1940s
Come around to the cigar store tomorrow morning at ten o'clock and we'll talk about it, okay? We'll see what we can work out. +++$+++ 1990s
Knox, you are so infuriating! +++$+++ 1980s
You can let go. +++$+++ 2000s
Surely you'll grant me a final word. +++$+++ 2000s
What! +++$+++ 1970s
Aaah ... stop picking on me... you're as bad as the rest of them. +++$+++ 1960s
What, did you see it work in some movie you got beat up in? +++$+++ 1990s
They were inside.  They booby trapped her apartment! +++$+++ 2000s
That bum.  So what if he has a Porsche, he can't treat you like that...it's Friday night for crissakes. +++$+++ 1980s
You pathetic piece of shit. I can say whatever the fuck I want and you won't have a clue, you fucking retard. +++$+++ 2000s
Tim, you're gonna have to let go.  I'm going to count to three. +++$+++ 1990s
That's right, Mr. Stone -- there is --  -- just one little formality. I'd like your signature here -- see. And when it's done -- it's done for seven years.  It's our usual form. Of course -- we may be able to take up the question of a renewal in due time. +++$+++ 2000s
That was before I found out what it was. +++$+++ 1990s
Let's go in the other room... +++$+++ 1990s
Telly is at Steven's? +++$+++ 1990s
Yeah ... +++$+++ 1990s
To set yourself a puzzle you won't ever solve. You know how many towns, how many		    * guys called James G? Or John G? Shit, Leonard, I'm a John G. +++$+++ 2000s
No, I'm sorry.  I'm saying I'm sorry. I talk like a jerk sometimes -- +++$+++ 1990s
We're alive. +++$+++ 1990s
... Looks like a convention. +++$+++ 1980s
I'm a hacker! +++$+++ 1990s
Ohhh yes.  No, no.  Just a little, you know...We're fine. +++$+++ 2000s
Right here, Mrs. Kane. +++$+++ 1940s
That's Kim...and this one's Thelma and that's Mrs. Willewska and this is daddy and that's Batman and over there is Robin. +++$+++ 1970s
Stop it, Dil -- +++$+++ 1990s
You've earned it -- the horse ranch on the Toulomoe -- the girl in the spotted gingham. +++$+++ 1940s
Chinese food? +++$+++ 1980s
You haven't finished your beer. +++$+++ 1950s
Ask if he can check how many sick days I've taken since I've worked here? +++$+++ 2000s
Me? +++$+++ 1930s
Honey, he is Mr. Right. +++$+++ 1990s
Uh, well, you just said you were going downtown. +++$+++ 1970s
My signal's fading. +++$+++ 1970s
We'll die if we stay here! +++$+++ 1990s
...And for our Supreme Commander over here and our Commander-in-Chief in Washington. +++$+++ 1970s
No. +++$+++ 1990s
Know what?  Know what, goddammit! +++$+++ 1990s
Yeah. I mean a little, you know. +++$+++ 1980s
Watch? You mean just watch me? Doing it alone? +++$+++ 1970s
No wonder your uncle's so weird... +++$+++ 2000s
What, again? +++$+++ 1930s
So are you.  I mean you're a neat guy. We better get back. +++$+++ 1990s
I think you should ask Mr. Rand that. +++$+++ 1970s
Now look, darlin', this is no time to go off into the fourth dimension. +++$+++ 1990s
It's okay. +++$+++ 2000s
I thought only hookers drank those things. +++$+++ 1990s
How the hell would I know? I wasn't a philosophy major. +++$+++ 1990s
Mike's out -- I think he went to Silver Meadow to see if you were hanging around there. +++$+++ 1990s
Oh. Have a good day at school. +++$+++ 1990s
I was informed just as Laszlo was about to leave the hotel, so I knew I'd be on time. +++$+++ 1940s
You see? We can't have anything to do with John.  You and me will go down to the parlor. +++$+++ 1950s
If you put her on the shit list because of her reaction here tonight I'll go to Dickerson. +++$+++ 1980s
Where's you get the alloy for the throttle itself? +++$+++ 1990s
I'm sorry, I should have been watching where I... +++$+++ 2000s
Lay on, MacDuff. +++$+++ 1960s
Unfortunately no, these Americans are smart, they pay me only half now, half when I get them back to Cairo, so I must go all the way. +++$+++ 1990s
No, c'mon, stop playin'. The girl that you kissed when we got there. Where s he live at? +++$+++ 2000s
Evan wake up, oh please wake up! +++$+++ 2000s
How many you got in there? +++$+++ 1970s
Uh-huh. +++$+++ 1940s
What happened? +++$+++ 1980s
I don't know what you're talking about. +++$+++ 2000s
No it's not. Do you know how you did it Will? +++$+++ 1980s
It's all right. I'm not hurt. +++$+++ 1940s
GUARD!!! +++$+++ 2000s
You left out condescending. +++$+++ 1990s
What unit were you with ? +++$+++ 1970s
No. +++$+++ 1990s
Murder. +++$+++ 2000s
You're a good man. Jimmy the Finn. +++$+++ 2000s
Bastard. +++$+++ 1980s
Point is, listen to them.  They've lost faith in old symbols. They're ready to bond with you, the icon of the future.  If it works, don't fix it... +++$+++ 1990s
Come on, I'll show you around. +++$+++ 1980s
... How did you get into marine salvage? +++$+++ 1990s
No, this is just the second unit. We'll do the main footage later. +++$+++ 1990s
Do we have to? +++$+++ 1950s
I have need of friends. +++$+++ 1980s
What guns? +++$+++ 1970s
Let's just say the Force is something a Jedi Warrior deals with.  It is an energy field in oneself, a power that controls ones acts, yet obeys ones commands.  It is nothing, yet it makes marvels appear before your very eyes. All living things generate this Force field, even you. +++$+++ 1970s
Come on Dorothy. +++$+++ 1980s
How's it going? +++$+++ 1990s
Yes! +++$+++ 1930s
She was beaten, and bloodied, and it was going to go on, uni... +++$+++ 1990s
Always thought "can't" wasn't in a man's vocabulary. +++$+++ 2000s
Don't you? +++$+++ 1990s
We got married at the City Hall and I think it gave bad luck the whole marriage. +++$+++ 1980s
Yes. +++$+++ 1990s
Me. I can only take it up to fifteen minutes. Cause I get bored. +++$+++ 1990s
What are you going to do? +++$+++ 2000s
Will I believe you when you tell me something? +++$+++ 2000s
There's my dad with Joanie. +++$+++ 2000s
I thought I'd invest in a film. I want to sort of become involved in the process of making a film, meet the people who make films, learn how it's done... +++$+++ 1970s
No, no... But Mark -- a jealous boyfriend gone mad. Maybe he kills men you date. +++$+++ 1980s
There's nothing more to talk about. +++$+++ 2000s
By the way, we gotta go see Ma tomorrow. +++$+++ 1980s
No -- in my room. +++$+++ 1960s
What kind of animal? +++$+++ 1980s
Unscheduled surgery.  He'll be waltzing along momentarily.  What're you doing tonight? +++$+++ 1980s
You told him I was here and he wanted to know if I was beating you up. +++$+++ 1970s
You killed Santa Claus? +++$+++ 2000s
Her doctors murdered her. They gave her the wrong anesthetic and they put her in the hospital for life.  Her doctors murdered her. +++$+++ 1980s
Did you meet Captain Kirk? +++$+++ 1990s
Apropos of nothing... so. So so so so -- +++$+++ 2000s
Today is March second, 2063. The time in Montana is oh-eight-forty- five. +++$+++ 1990s
One shot -- for emergencies. +++$+++ 1990s
It means...I'm a paranoid nitwit who's never let his baby girl out of his sight for the simple reason he's a paranoid nitwit. So why don't you just say &quot;Oh Dad&quot; and get on the damn plane already? +++$+++ 1990s
And I won't never tell about the money. +++$+++ 1950s
Lynn. +++$+++ 1990s
Not according to the men in blue. +++$+++ 1990s
Don't thank us too fast, Viktor. You know what we have to do? +++$+++ 2010s
Yeah. +++$+++ 2000s
Diz--get what he says to the people back in that State. It's up to you and the boys. Keep those wires hot. Fire away, pal! +++$+++ 1930s
What for?  We've got a job to finish ...Why are you making the monitor? +++$+++ 1980s
Cute young thing, too. +++$+++ 1980s
You did. +++$+++ 2000s
You, too, Roy. +++$+++ 1990s
Just be cool. +++$+++ 1990s
Did Sam call to tell you he wouldn't be over this weekend? +++$+++ 2000s
That's for me to know and for you to find out. I'll see you. I mean call you. okay? +++$+++ 1990s
Why? +++$+++ 1990s
Well I think they come from... angel lights on their mothers chest and whispers into her ear. That makes good babies start to grow. And bad babies come from when a fallen angel squeezes in down there, and they start to grow, grow, till they come out down there. I don't know where good babies come out. And you can't tell the difference... except bad babies cry a lot... and they make their fathers go away... and their mothers get very ill... die sometimes. +++$+++ 1980s
Jesus... +++$+++ 1990s
Yeah -- ? +++$+++ 2000s
Exactly. And then -- maybe -- not right away -- There's a room right off the bedroom -- It would be perfect for a nursery.  It's a walk in humidor right now -- but if I took out the refrigeration unit -- +++$+++ 2000s
Not one word.  That's an order. +++$+++ 1990s
What happened to title dictates behavior? +++$+++ 1990s
Never better. +++$+++ 1990s
Took a pig-slicker to the heart. +++$+++ 2000s
O.K. +++$+++ 1980s
Please!... Trust me this much...  I'll be back. Look, there is something I should tell you. The fishing club that old lady mentioned, the pieces off the flag. +++$+++ 1970s
I was in love once, Willow.  She had a hold on my heart.  I could barely function.  I *was* a great swordsman!  I was knighted!  I could have been king! +++$+++ 1980s
Not every day? +++$+++ 1990s
-- dating the crash at least that old. +++$+++ 1990s
I don't know. He was right behind us. Wait here. I'll be right back. +++$+++ 2000s
Johnny, you're a real jerk-off. +++$+++ 1980s
I should go. I should leave today. +++$+++ 1930s
Will you shut up! +++$+++ 1990s
How are you, Nick? +++$+++ 1990s
Thank you.  But who sits there? +++$+++ 1940s
That's good. It's not better. Where? +++$+++ 1980s
Oh, I understand, all right. I've been understanding since I was seventeen. And the next step is, as long as you're going to see me tomorrow, why don't you stay the night. +++$+++ 1950s
A month. +++$+++ 1990s
We ran a search on relatives. He has a cousin in town -- Clarence Teal. Smalltime thief. Last known address was on Pine Street. He moved out a month ago. We've got a couple leads on him to check out. +++$+++ 1990s
Nothing is going on with us, is it? +++$+++ 2000s
I think he's got a terrific personality. +++$+++ 1970s
I have coffee in the thermos. +++$+++ 1980s
Jake, this is your father's bedroom. +++$+++ 1980s
Nonsense. A man is always ready for marriage -- with the right girl. And Lisa Fremont is the right girl for any man with half a brain, who can get one eye open. +++$+++ 1950s
Mostly. Sometimes they do things. +++$+++ 1980s
I'll offer you more than it's worth. And you know you won't have to move. Nothing will change except the name on the deed, you have my word. +++$+++ 2000s
Years ago. And it was Zaltar who stole it. +++$+++ 1980s
No problem. +++$+++ 1990s
Dad--? +++$+++ 1990s
HARRY, this is my fantasy! I suggest you leave - before I imagine something horrible. +++$+++ 2000s
Ed, I am so very disappointed in you. +++$+++ 1980s
But the time is now. Soon others will come. +++$+++ 1990s
Kept calling it "murder" when I did it. +++$+++ 2000s
This is Claudia, Anna's friend...  You've never met my husband, have you? +++$+++ 1960s
I know. I know. Help me, here. Look around. +++$+++ 1990s
Your Majesty! +++$+++ 1990s
She's entering deep sleep now. Heart rate's a little high due to anxiety, but otherwise she's nicely relaxed. All normal. She could dream at any time now.  Right now she's like a diver on the bottom of an ocean no one's mapped yet. Waiting to see what shows up. +++$+++ 1980s
He'll be here.  Look, take this for now. +++$+++ 1980s
They only kill them when they love them? +++$+++ 2000s
Listen to me I -- +++$+++ 2000s
Remember my friend we saw on t.v.? +++$+++ 1990s
What? +++$+++ 1980s
Get rid of them. +++$+++ 2000s
It's me or Wallace, Jack.  Wallace's third party is only going to help McGovern.  I need your support. +++$+++ 1990s
You mean with the flowers...? +++$+++ 2000s
This is terrible.  Either there's a monster in my kitchen or I'm completely crazy. +++$+++ 1980s
She's not here. +++$+++ 1990s
Get up. +++$+++ 1990s
Mr. Swayzak! How ya doin'? +++$+++ 1990s
How did you find me? +++$+++ 1990s
Do you ever regret things you've done? +++$+++ 1990s
Don't tell me you aren't ashamed of that because I know. +++$+++ 2000s
Go tuck yourself, Bill. +++$+++ 1990s
Or you can quit. +++$+++ 1980s
Dr. Bright, I don't have to do anything. +++$+++ 1990s
Martin, I'm not connected to those people anymore. Not since I walked out of a loanshark Operation in Miami. +++$+++ 1990s
In ages, I know, me neither. +++$+++ 1990s
I can't help how I think. You're trained a certain way when you're a kid and you can't change. +++$+++ 1940s
No, I'm not. +++$+++ 1990s
Did -- did you -- +++$+++ 2000s
I only have something like sixteen weeks. +++$+++ 1980s
No. +++$+++ 1990s
Well, a rough estimate... I'd say fifteen. +++$+++ 1970s
Yes. +++$+++ 1990s
Oh, it's nothing... I better go, I'll talk to you later. +++$+++ 2000s
Yeah.  Go on, beat it. +++$+++ 1970s
It's always the women that start the trouble. +++$+++ 1980s
I'm fine. +++$+++ 1990s
She's a Commie pig. We're going to nail every last one... +++$+++ 1970s
You know, this future shit sucks. I'll fucking do it. +++$+++ 2000s
Okay. +++$+++ 2000s
No it doesn't. I see right through you. +++$+++ 1990s
But I'm afraid of water, so that's been holding my career back a little bit. +++$+++ 2000s
If there's a funnier man in the world than Herbie Temple at the Palace...uh...pardon us for not catching the name, we were too busy laughing.  No, make that 'screaming'.  It's sweet of you, J.J., thanks. Probably see you at Twenty One tonight.  No, for supper, late. Right. 'Bye... +++$+++ 1950s
-- And the cooling unit on the other. +++$+++ 1970s
What happened? +++$+++ 1990s
What's tira misu? +++$+++ 1990s
Who wrote it? +++$+++ 1990s
Game, set and match, Steven. You've outdone yourself. And I know it's not good manners to ask the magician how he did it, but inquiring minds are desperate to know: just what did really happen to Ms. Marr? +++$+++ 1990s
Out of the question. +++$+++ 1990s
No.  But he has no love for the Empire, that much I know ... +++$+++ 1980s
What are you going to do with my day tomorrow, M'sieu Laval? +++$+++ 1930s
But facts! They have to be verified. Anything from their past, their present, business, personal -- arrests, affairs ... And whoever comes up with the sleaziest, most degrading material -- I'11 give you ten thousand dollars. And you get to be on Ed TV.  Hah? +++$+++ 1990s
Mais non, c'est pour toi. +++$+++ 1970s
Yeah.  But that's what I wanted to talk to you about. +++$+++ 1980s
Yes. +++$+++ 2000s
Get him out of here! +++$+++ 1970s
Going somewhere? +++$+++ 1990s
Who? +++$+++ 2000s
WHAT did you say? +++$+++ 1980s
Come, everyone, let us repair to the main chamber. Project Vulcan is about to begin. Scott, are you coming? +++$+++ 1990s
I didn't used to be afraid of it. +++$+++ 1940s
I killed Bob Ray Lemon, didn't I? +++$+++ 1990s
You're welcome. It's a lot more interesting than just flinging off your clothes and boning away on the neighbor's swing set. +++$+++ 1980s
I stood alone on the green, searching for something, and I started to walk to the church. But then the darkness closed in, I was alone in the dark, being pulled into darkness, and I fought to wake up... +++$+++ 1950s
What trail are you trying to throw me off now? +++$+++ 1990s
Is your confidence in me fully restored? +++$+++ 1960s
And there will come <u>another</u> moment. When the stakes are <u>really</u> there. And she will look back on this.  And remember how good it felt.  How easy it was. +++$+++ 1990s
I've come, I'm here, I'm staying. Unless there are ticks. +++$+++ 1990s
Until he's done. +++$+++ 1990s
Being rich is <u>not a trap</u>. That is a dirty lie perpetuated by rich people to keep the failures from killing them. +++$+++ 2000s
So cool. +++$+++ 1990s
To get on the board.  Yeah.  How you goan'a get on the board sell'n a Polack?  And I'll tell you, I'll tell you what else.  You listening? I'll tell you what else: don't ever try to sell an Indian. +++$+++ 1990s
I've never heard of her. Maybe something else was on his mind. +++$+++ 2000s
Attack? Who -- or should I say what from? +++$+++ 1960s
Yes, I agree, I think so too. +++$+++ 1970s
No. You don't. +++$+++ 2000s
He may be a kook but he's also been all over the world with them.  He even swam in the Grimetti with killer Niles all around him, he never got nipped. +++$+++ 1990s
Is it fair to say that you do not know for <u>certain</u> which it was. +++$+++ 1990s
Good. +++$+++ 2000s
He was I.A.  He probably asked her about it. +++$+++ 1990s
I am. +++$+++ 1990s
Yeah.  You don't wanna know the details. +++$+++ 1990s
Good idea.  Flying over mountains can give you some nasty surprises.  Go too low, one of the clouds might have a big rock inside it. +++$+++ 1990s
Wa-shee is like... a dumpling. Like tallow we put in stew. I think he was calling you chubby boy. +++$+++ 1990s
Must be exciting, Beautiful place, beautiful people. +++$+++ 2000s
I don't believe it. He looks so...normal. He seems so... out of it. So...undangerous. +++$+++ 2000s
How does it feel to get that much money just for being you? +++$+++ 2000s
Segretti criss-crossed the country over ten times in six months--and never stayed anyplace over a night or two.  Switch to another station, huh? You're driving me crazy with that. +++$+++ 1970s
Well, seems like Zanuck's got himself a baseball picture. +++$+++ 1950s
I'm getting married. +++$+++ 1980s
I do. +++$+++ 1990s
No, you idiot. I said "Is it a receptacle tip?" Not, is Luis a despicable twit. Is it a receptacle tip? Get off me. +++$+++ 2000s
Ever see NATURAL BORN KILLERS? Well, Derek and I have this whole Mickey/Mallory-Woody Harrelson/Juliette Lewis thing going on. +++$+++ 1990s
Who to? +++$+++ 1930s
Today ain't my day. +++$+++ 2000s
And if the truth is so horrible that it will haunt your dreams for all time? +++$+++ 2000s
This was World War I? +++$+++ 1990s
Fuck you. +++$+++ 1990s
"Los Angeles, UPI: Elijah Muhammad, 67-year-old leader of the Black Muslim Movement, today faced paternity suits from two former secretaries who charged he fathered their four children..." +++$+++ 1990s
I don't care about the intention. I just know your Cross Action is a plus on our side. I've seen it come through four times. +++$+++ 1970s
Think again! +++$+++ 1940s
So now I got all those coffins on my hands - and I hate to see them go to waste. +++$+++ 1950s
It just is. +++$+++ 1970s
End a April. +++$+++ 1990s
And thank you as well for that conversational hiatus; I generally refrain from speech while engaged in gustation. There are those who attempt both at the same time but I find it course and vulgar. Now where were we? +++$+++ 2000s
Is he....? +++$+++ 1980s
Spare me. +++$+++ 2000s
Joe could help him. If we can get in touch with Joe, Joe could get him to a doctor, Joe could get a doctor to come and see him. +++$+++ 1990s
A lot of 'em choose both. There's not like a borderline between the good people and the bad people--you're not either on one side or the other-- +++$+++ 1990s
Martini! +++$+++ 1970s
Lord Walton assures me this guy's one of the very top scholars in the English art world.  Has a couple of doctorates no less. +++$+++ 1990s
What is wrong with you? +++$+++ 1990s
Then, that being so, why is today special?  Why have you come back to see me?  Is it that new file they gave you? +++$+++ 2000s
I've always wanted to learn something like that. +++$+++ 1990s
I'm not in the mood right now, Ray. +++$+++ 2000s
Why? +++$+++ 1990s
Ah, so that's it.  To you I'm just a girl. +++$+++ 2000s
That's worth fifteen grand to ya? +++$+++ 1970s
You're ready, don't worry. +++$+++ 1990s
Don't you miss it? +++$+++ 2000s
Really? +++$+++ 1930s
No. +++$+++ 2000s
The first reports came in at about ten. +++$+++ 1990s
A man has my family.  Gold watch here. Dark tan. +++$+++ 2000s
-- Kobo... I know.  He killed two of my partners.  One in New York, one at the printing plant. +++$+++ 1980s
'Mr Rothstein' is good enough. +++$+++ 1990s
Yes, Reverend? +++$+++ 1970s
Cut that shit out.  Maybe before, but not now. I want to help you. I'm on your side. +++$+++ 1980s
No problem, sir! +++$+++ 1990s
I snuck back to my car, trying to convince myself it never happened.  And when I woke up in the hospital...somehow it hadn't.  Until now. +++$+++ 2000s
He wants to know who brought in the chalice. +++$+++ 1990s
I didn't ask you all that, Sweet Pea. I asked if you loved her. +++$+++ 1980s
Or rather, do you think you're being exploited or are you yourself exploiting the white image of the black artist from the ghetto? +++$+++ 1990s
No she's not. +++$+++ 1990s
Don't we already have someone to do that for us? +++$+++ 1990s
That'll bring me down, too. Eventually.  You gotta know that. +++$+++ 1990s
Well you'll always be Sadie to me. +++$+++ 1990s
Neither do I, sir.  C:  And this is the worst one, we find Ryan and he's wounded.  Not only does he not carry my gear, we have to carry his gear. And him. +++$+++ 1990s
Yeah, right, vision is highly over- rated. +++$+++ 1990s
We're not cops.  We're from Massachusettes.  I mean, does he look like a cop? +++$+++ 2000s
Yes. She bought my sister's business. +++$+++ 1940s
You'll visit again? +++$+++ 1980s
Bullshit! Your uncle told you! +++$+++ 1990s
If you don't mind my asking... Who's close to you? +++$+++ 1980s
Midshipman, you're a tiger. +++$+++ 1980s
Who? +++$+++ 1990s
I don’t care who you are.  It’s Christmas and like I told you the building is closed. +++$+++ 2000s
Why, you... you little bastard! +++$+++ 1980s
He was, like, a total babe +++$+++ 1990s
Lugosi's washed-up.  What else you got? +++$+++ 1990s
No, Rose, he'll help you. +++$+++ 1990s
Any untoward "revelation" regarding, uh... +++$+++ 1990s
French fries. I like to eat them pretty good. +++$+++ 1990s
Handymen, Earl.  We're handymen. +++$+++ 1990s
I ruined your wedding night. +++$+++ 2000s
...That's fine. +++$+++ 1990s
You want to give me an AIDS <u>test</u>?! +++$+++ 1990s
...to be off the island tonight. +++$+++ 1990s
There's always an excuse, isn't there? +++$+++ 1980s
Hey, you know, what can I say, I dig those cute little sweaters she wears. +++$+++ 1990s
Neil, you're not gonna... +++$+++ 1980s
Dr. Milo, please don't call my wife mad. +++$+++ 1970s
No. Keep rubbing. +++$+++ 2000s
If I smell one drop of Scotch on your breath, my friend -- +++$+++ 1980s
You get off on abuse or something? +++$+++ 2000s
Uum... around ten? +++$+++ 1990s
Taylor -- just keep quiet and we may get away with this. Remember that men all look alike to most apes. +++$+++ 2000s
Oh, yeah. +++$+++ 2000s
Mulder. Move away from the door. We're coming through it. +++$+++ 1990s
Right there. +++$+++ 1990s
He couldn't have. +++$+++ 1990s
I have to. It was Irving August -- everything Mrs. Redi said -— it fits in with what I saw -— she even knew I'd seen his body on the subway. +++$+++ 1940s
What'd he get? +++$+++ 1990s
So. Is it different to how you imagined it? +++$+++ 2000s
Well... that's wonderful -- I'll stop by there for a drink. +++$+++ 1970s
Twenty-eight years, Frank. +++$+++ 1980s
It'll be fine, yeah. +++$+++ 2000s
Stay late at your work tomorrow night and I'll bring you the gear. +++$+++ 1990s
Great.  Really. +++$+++ 2000s
You figured what? +++$+++ 1990s
He didn't <u>give</u> me-- +++$+++ 1990s
Do you have any luggage, Mister --  Gladstone? +++$+++ 1960s
I don't gamble, Mr Reynolds. +++$+++ 1990s
I'd like a word with you, Jack. +++$+++ 2000s
Guys, he's right behind us! +++$+++ 2000s
Yeah, but how are you supposed to make the first move? +++$+++ 1990s
Oh, yes!  we'll keep him in here, obviously.  But if he had to leave and we were with him. +++$+++ 1970s
Dylan.  And...  Chase.  My God, Wes, did you know? +++$+++ 1990s
Can you see a body? +++$+++ 1990s
Arnie, help me.  Doesn't anyone owe us money? +++$+++ 2000s
'Tis but a scratch. +++$+++ 1970s
How could I?  I will do my best. After all, you see, I am financially interested. +++$+++ 1940s
...I just don't know what... to do– +++$+++ 1990s
Hey, you could call me "Bernie," forget the "Mister LaPlante" stuff.  You are naive. +++$+++ 1990s
We'll have to make them come to us, won't we? And since there are two of them, we're going to set two plans in motion.  First: we must move the entire hospital by tomorrow night. +++$+++ 1990s
Do you love Drew? +++$+++ 1990s
What? +++$+++ 1980s
Your insight is enlightening. +++$+++ 2000s
I wish I knew. +++$+++ 1940s
Well, suppose she got a little further north than she should have.  Got stuck in the ice. The passengers and crew evacuated. She froze into the ice pack, which moved further north, where it froze in solid. They write it off. Fifty years later, the whole global warming thing happens. The ice melts, she gets loose and floats around til somebody runs into her. +++$+++ 2000s
Good. +++$+++ 1980s
Why, I think it's very sweet of the children-- +++$+++ 1930s
Tough...  ...I get off duty at five-thirty.  How long you been divorced? +++$+++ 1970s
You know, I've been going over our financial condition - if you'll pardon the expression... +++$+++ 1950s
I don't know. +++$+++ 1990s
Well, pull in your reel, Mr. Fielding. You're barking up the wrong fish. +++$+++ 1950s
What's this? +++$+++ 2000s
Each circumstance requires a different tactic. +++$+++ 1990s
I dunno.  Marry the first whore who's nice to me, I guess.  Get a job in a motorcycle shop.  So long, you guys. +++$+++ 1970s
I dined at the prison. +++$+++ 1980s
Look, look, look. You gotta go now, okay? The customers complain. +++$+++ 1990s
Okay how many fingers am I holding up? +++$+++ 2000s
Great! I'II build a house-- right over there, with a veranda looking out to sea. And I'll plant a garden! Papayas, pineapples, bananas, mangoes--- anything'll grow here. And I'II fish in the lagoon, and we can go sailing in a dugout canoe, and--- +++$+++ 1980s
What? +++$+++ 1940s
Yes. I have never known birds of different species to flock together. The very concept is unimaginable.  Why if that happened, we wouldn't have a chance. How could we possible hope to fight them? +++$+++ 1960s
And then Sam, you and I clean up whatever's left to be cleaned. +++$+++ 1990s
That's it then. That's it. I've always been alone. That's why I'm a good driver. I can handle it. See, I can think on my feet. I survive, I'm a thinker. And I can sit there in front of your house for two hours and it don't bother me. Some people can't do it! Some people are ranting and raving, "Tell them fuckin' people to get out here and get in this car, I can't-- I want a go!" Where you gonna go? You're gonna wind up back in your garage at seven o'clock at night. You ain't going nowhere. You leave your house in the morning you get back to your house in the evening. What's the big deal, right? +++$+++ 1990s
Oh. And, Harry, he's the one who likes magic? +++$+++ 2000s
I've got a lot of respect for you too.  For the way you feel about your family. +++$+++ 2000s
Dissent? +++$+++ 2000s
Just before she died she came to-- +++$+++ 1980s
He's dead. +++$+++ 2000s
You need a bass and a sax, don't you? +++$+++ 1950s
I was at Beadles. +++$+++ 1990s
Very impressive. +++$+++ 1970s
Man, you play like a kokonut. You got to call him at least. +++$+++ 1960s
Thank you, Peter.  Thank you so much. +++$+++ 1990s
Yeah I'm goin' to bring you somethin' all right. I've decided to make you a special project of mine. You ain't goin' to have to look for me at all. +++$+++ 2000s
It's certainly the best chance they've had to kill you. +++$+++ 1990s
Sure you do. This ward is air tight, I have a little extra oxygen pumped in, keeps my spirits up. +++$+++ 1970s
Aha! -- The Baron. What do you want here? +++$+++ 1930s
... And the children thought I should take a trip. +++$+++ 1990s
I know the secret.  The worm is the spice... the spice is the worm. +++$+++ 1980s
It's dangerous.  It's dangerous, to me, personally. +++$+++ 1990s
So your husband said he's think it over.  Encouraged Mr. Miyamoto to believe he might sell to h... +++$+++ 1990s
Oh, don't do this! +++$+++ 1980s
Walter, I'm sure there's a reason you brought your dirty undies-- +++$+++ 1990s
Beth? +++$+++ 1990s
Right -- want another one? +++$+++ 1990s
You missed my point; you are no longer an owner. +++$+++ 1970s
A machine.  But a machine that does what? +++$+++ 1990s
Dude, we don't have watches. +++$+++ 1990s
Well, I'll tell you why I ask. You see, I've got a girl who works in the Auditing Department of the Territorial Administrator and I haven't been able to get her on the phone for the past week or so, and with all these stories one hears, I'm a little concerned about her. +++$+++ 1960s
I love to swim, and I don't mind the cold at all. It's invigorating. +++$+++ 1970s
There seem to be lots of reasons why I shouldn't. +++$+++ 1990s
Why are you talking like that? +++$+++ 2000s
I want amphetamines. +++$+++ 2000s
Yeah. +++$+++ 1980s
Yeah, non-believer?  Here's yours...  "Scorpio, October 24 to November 22: Jupiter is in conflict with Saturn, so proceed with caution..." +++$+++ 2000s
That's okay, I assure you. It's just that I was trying to work – +++$+++ 1990s
What are you talking about? +++$+++ 1980s
Karma...  You know, if you do something bad to somebody fate will pay you back by something bad happening to you. +++$+++ 1990s
A bank? +++$+++ 2000s
Ninety degrees to the left, I hope. How does she feel about you? +++$+++ 1990s
That's it. +++$+++ 2000s
I call. What you got? +++$+++ 1940s
We should be so lucky. +++$+++ 2000s
Okay, Kent, call your people and tell them the Prodigal Son is coming home. FAVORING CLARK -- Happy now, he turns to leave the office. SHOT LOSES PERRY but we continue to hear his voice, o.s. +++$+++ 1980s
Dad! +++$+++ 1980s
Thank you; but it's missing something. +++$+++ 1960s
Do they have cable? +++$+++ 1990s
I had one, but it was taken at the battle of Condawn... +++$+++ 1970s
...wanna savor this. +++$+++ 2000s
Yes please! +++$+++ 1990s
I can't go nowhere. +++$+++ 1990s
I'm coming home right now, Ma. I'll be home in about two minutes. Tell Thomas stick around, I wanna see him about something. +++$+++ 1950s
...the Michelin commercial... +++$+++ 1990s
The G-man? +++$+++ 2000s
Yes. +++$+++ 1990s
That was unbelievable what you did to Lucas. The guy's an animal. +++$+++ 2000s
Pinkerton. It's been eight months. I see robberies. I see hold ups. But I do not see men on the end of nooses. +++$+++ 2000s
You weren't straight with us, Frankie, what else could we do? +++$+++ 1970s
Well, Stew, that's all thrashed out. By golly, I'm surely glad to see that you're not really sore. You know our racket - after all, news is news. +++$+++ 1930s
Okay. +++$+++ 1960s
Like a tea ceremony? +++$+++ 1970s
My name's Sophia. +++$+++ 2000s
Absolutely. +++$+++ 2000s
Don't be so amazed. It's a very ordinary matter. I'm Jacqueline's physician... Mr. Ward told me you were in town and Jacqueline has sent me to bring you to her. +++$+++ 1940s
My dear Talleyrand, none of the Kings of Europe bear any friendship for France.  It is easy for you to talk of reliable treaties.  The only treaties you have been able to negotiate are the ones I have won on the battlefield. +++$+++ 1990s
Town Police. +++$+++ 1970s
I've got to talk to you... +++$+++ 1990s
No, the children sleep with me. +++$+++ 1960s
Abby-- +++$+++ 1980s
Why did he ask if it was frozen? +++$+++ 1990s
Well,... I'm a singer by trade... Summer stock...nightclub revues... that kind of thing...It used to be what I absolutely lived for...God...I can do GYPSY backwards - every part- but, one night...in the middle of singing "Funny..... - it suddenly hit me... ...what does all of this really mean?  That, and the fact that all my friends are dead...God, I sound like a veteran. Dad would be so proud. +++$+++ 1990s
Do you still want me to stay? +++$+++ 2000s
She was torn apart! She died of a broken heart. +++$+++ 1990s
Yeah... I'll write a song.  Ha, ha. I don't know.  Life is funny! +++$+++ 1970s
Sit tight, Diz. The show commences in just a minute. +++$+++ 1930s
Which is? +++$+++ 1990s
I'm glad you feel that way, because I feel that way, too. +++$+++ 1980s
History's proven that where there's a nitrogenizer, there's a 12-legged signazoid.  They use it to make our food digestible for their systems. +++$+++ 1990s
"InGen."  What's InGen? +++$+++ 1990s
Ready? +++$+++ 1990s
Okay.  Yeah.  We know +++$+++ 1990s
Miss Ratched, would you please save a space for my aunt? She's comin' down from Portland. +++$+++ 1970s
Yeah, I can fix it. +++$+++ 1990s
People seem to like my cat. +++$+++ 1950s
Yeah. +++$+++ 1990s
It's Maria Portos. What should we do? +++$+++ 1990s
Then you meet someone special and all you want to do is toss them the key, say open up, step inside, but you can't because it's dark and there are demons and if anybody saw how ugly it was... +++$+++ 1990s
Be my friend. +++$+++ 1970s
I don't know...  What about the other women? +++$+++ 2000s
I... do you want me to leave? +++$+++ 1980s
"... encased in the armor of a demigod, Narcissus The Good continues his impossible climb in the arena where he was unjustly cast..." +++$+++ 2000s
no, no, no.  Certainly not.  I wasn't officialy enrolled, that's right. Was that unclear? +++$+++ 1990s
I do as I please. +++$+++ 2000s
My Jewish friend's grandmother did. +++$+++ 1990s
So how did you get off that island, anyway? +++$+++ 2000s
Here. Eat your head off. +++$+++ 1930s
Island.  Far. +++$+++ 1990s
There was some sophistos from the TV studios around the corner, laughing an govoreeting. The Devotchka was smecking away, and not caring about the wicked world one bit. Then the disc on the stereo twanged off and out, and in the short silence before the next one came on, she suddenly came with a burst of singing, and it was like for a moment, O my brothers, some great bird had flown into the milkbar and I felt all the malenky little hairs on my plott standing endwise, athe shivers crawling up like slow malenky lizards and then down again. Because I knew what she sang. It was a bit from the glorious 9th, by Ludwig van. Dim makes a lip-trump followed by a dog howl, followed by two fingers pronging twice in the air, followed by a clowny guffaw. Alex brings his stick down smartly on Dim's legs. +++$+++ 1970s
Do you want me to come up and tuck you in? +++$+++ 1980s
What do we do if there isn't? +++$+++ 1980s
What did he look like? +++$+++ 1970s
Mr. Bartholomew -- if you're trying to frighten me you're doing a really first-rate job! +++$+++ 1960s
She's pretty special. +++$+++ 2000s
I'm sorry to say that our time is running short, but before we close, I'd like to ask one final question. What sort of gardener, sir, would you be? +++$+++ 1970s
I'll cancel every meeting right now. I'll give you a job myself. I just wanted you to see what was out there. +++$+++ 1990s
...well, it suits you... +++$+++ 1990s
Are you breaking the contract? +++$+++ 1950s
I don't thinks you'd want me tripping all over you in front of everybody. +++$+++ 1990s
Y'want to gimme Brigham's pistol? +++$+++ 2000s
Is that just beer? +++$+++ 2000s
... That's funny... I had this job with Enzo... we got fired too. +++$+++ 1980s
Why? +++$+++ 1990s
It's not really anyone per se, it's more of separate groupings. +++$+++ 1990s
Well, oh... +++$+++ 1990s
George is great but I know what you mean. +++$+++ 1970s
The Board of Parrish Communications - is hereby called to order.  Our sole order of business is an acceptance of John Bontecou's generous offer and -- +++$+++ 1990s
Old tricks are the best tricks eh? +++$+++ 1990s
Say Matt, you haven't done anything about what you saw today, have you? +++$+++ 1930s
Yah, but that TruCoat - +++$+++ 1990s
One-two-three, one-two-three, twirl- two-three... +++$+++ 1930s
Dumb riddles, Merlin. I am your King. +++$+++ 1980s
But </u>alive</u>! +++$+++ 1990s
That's what I want to talk to you about? +++$+++ 1990s
Shit... I thought they was gonna get us. I was even... scared a little... just for a minute.  Was you ever scared in them days? +++$+++ 1990s
Damn... damn... damn... +++$+++ 1990s
But it is a part of our lives too --a part of our past, It's a Goya reproduction. Those three cats --  are supposed to be the most beautifully drawn cats in Western art. +++$+++ 1940s
You got to sit on Eldridge... +++$+++ 1990s
How do you know? +++$+++ 1990s
I'm looking at you, and the whole time I can't help thinking you had your willie inside her hootchie-kooch. +++$+++ 1990s
Well I'm certain Doctor Spangler will want to talk with you; excuse me. +++$+++ 1970s
Good-bye.  Well, your luck is holding. They sublet your place. You're homeless. Frank's got a line on another place you can use for now. +++$+++ 1990s
You want me to fuck you? Is that it? Okay, come here. Take your clothes off. Get into bed. +++$+++ 1980s
Like do anything, you know. +++$+++ 1970s
Oh, Mr. Dickson - they're going to arrest Matt. They think he did it! +++$+++ 1930s
He filmed his victims. +++$+++ 1990s
So? How was school today? +++$+++ 2000s
Yeah. Well -- that's the way it crumbles, cookie-wise. Go to sleep. +++$+++ 1960s
I don't have a week.  This case never should have come to trial. You know better.  You're Mr. Independent.  You want to be independent?  Be independent now. I've got no sympathy for you. +++$+++ 1970s
Isn't "bait" the word you used? +++$+++ 1970s
Oh come on!  Even you can see its value. +++$+++ 1950s
No. +++$+++ 1970s
Everyone out of the rigging NOW! +++$+++ 1990s
Nah, let's just take a look-see. +++$+++ 2000s
A .38. +++$+++ 1990s
...Mrs. Calvert? +++$+++ 1990s
Ti amo. +++$+++ 1980s
Wait. You hungry?  You gotta be hungry, you just flew in from China. And what'd they feed you, Chinese food, right?  Then you gotta be hungry.  Hell, it doesn't matter, I'm hungry.  We'll get some food on the way to the Consulate. +++$+++ 1990s
Good. +++$+++ 1940s

And Skynet fights back. +++$+++ 1990s
I know you wouldn't need Leon if Heidi was treating you right.  The thing I don't understand is why you come out and sleep with Heidi anyway?  You got two kids on welfare now.  What're you goin' to bed with her, you don't have enough with one wife and two kids on welfare, you want a wife and three kids on welfare? +++$+++ 1970s
... Manly? +++$+++ 1990s
No thank you. +++$+++ 2000s
-- good afternoon -- +++$+++ 1970s

Let go of me! +++$+++ 1990s

Quiet! +++$+++ 1930s
CRIMINAL +++$+++ 1980s
But you don't like coming here. Be honest, Walter. +++$+++ 2000s
Just some guy. Does it even matter who? I stopped asking myself why a long time ago. No reason, no conspiracy; just bad fucking luck. A couple of junkies, too			 * strung out to realize that your wife didn't live alone. When you killed him,			* I've never seen you so happy - I was convinced you'd remember. But it didn't stick, like nothing ever sticks. Like this won't stick. +++$+++ 2000s
I think they call it a pasture. +++$+++ 1990s
Hey, Nick! God damn!... What've you been doin', I mean... +++$+++ 1970s

Your mother and I do not wish to be disturbed for three full hours. +++$+++ 1970s
Fine. Welcome. Come sit down. +++$+++ 1990s
$10,000! I don't know what to do, Ed. I don't know what I *can* do. Even though I know who the sonofabitch is. +++$+++ 2000s
You're right, madame, it will all be over by Thursday. +++$+++ 1930s
Not a problem unless you're gonna make -- +++$+++ 2000s
Do you mind if I ask you a personal question? +++$+++ 1990s
I've learned so much since then.  And I'll return to finish ... I promise that, master. +++$+++ 1980s
The food doesn't please you? +++$+++ 1990s
They could be as curious about us as we are about them. +++$+++ 1950s
With smoke. +++$+++ 1960s
Eddie, how was I? +++$+++ 1990s
The key to success is using the right tools. +++$+++ 1990s
I know it's over, asshole, I -- +++$+++ 2000s
We need to give you a physical, so we know what got zapped. +++$+++ 1990s
But we need a creative dissent. Our voices are not joined in any harmonious chorus, but the differences are differences of emphasis, not of fundamentals. Now, the new alignment's greatest need is to communicate with all its elements, rather than march along in parallel line that never converge.  Tomorrow as we focus the new movement more clearly, we will gain a new unity. +++$+++ 1970s
I'll pay you another visit, with a share of the profits, once its sold. +++$+++ 2000s
I sure do. +++$+++ 2000s
How many deaths is he responsible for? How many innocent people? You may only get one shot at a man like Renard. Same circumstances, I’d do the same again. +++$+++ 1990s
I never had anything before, Epps.  I never was anybody.  Not the kind of somebody you can be with a pocket full of gold coins.  When I was in high school I used to-- +++$+++ 1990s
Even now. +++$+++ 1990s
It's utterly beautiful.  I wish I could be creative. +++$+++ 1950s
I'm sorry. +++$+++ 1990s
Bullshit! Would it have happened to you? +++$+++ 1990s
Yes. Shall we start on it right now-- or order dinner first? +++$+++ 1930s
Oh fuck that. You don't have to try and impress anyone. You think I give a shit? You think I sweat that skanky whore waitress... +++$+++ 1990s
We still have some extra ones, don't we?  Maybe we can just -- +++$+++ 1990s
Yes! +++$+++ 1980s
They're truck drivers. +++$+++ 2000s
I tried to tell myself it was for the best, that there was a reason behind it. But... Del? +++$+++ 2000s
I do <u>not</u> like you. +++$+++ 1990s
What's the maid's address? +++$+++ 1970s
No. Precisely. We begin by coveting what we see every day. Don't you feel eyes moving over your body, Clarice? I hardly see how you couldn't. And don't your eyes move over the things you want? +++$+++ 1990s
Yet you stood up to be counted with the enemy of everything the Grail stands for -- who gives a damn what you think? +++$+++ 1980s
How ya doin' Miss Evans? +++$+++ 1980s

Bye. +++$+++ 2000s
Well, the Hindus say -- and the beatniks also -- that in the next life some of us will come back as ants. Some will be butterflies. Others will be elephants or creatures of the sea. +++$+++ 1990s
It'll tell you pretty much everything about us... +++$+++ 1980s
...campus security...send someone...check out...place... +++$+++ 1990s
I do not know.  I pray that I shall never have to raise my sword against one that I call friend. +++$+++ 1990s
Yeah but, she reminds me of this chick that I remember from fourth grade... called a... shit, what did we call her?  Oh yeah, Patty Pee-pee Pants... when ever she got called on by Miss Chumski, this chick would piss in her pants and start bawling. +++$+++ 2000s
Mickey Spillane? +++$+++ 1990s
It was full of this awful pink ooze. +++$+++ 1980s
Well.  You're sorry and I'm sorry. +++$+++ 2000s
What's your fucking point? +++$+++ 1990s
Well... what the fuck, man? +++$+++ 1970s
Annabelle, daddy and I will always be there. That's one time always is always.  You can call him after dinner but... +++$+++ 1990s
Kay, um... how, uh, fast does this thing actually go ... ? +++$+++ 1990s
But he's the head of InGen! +++$+++ 1990s
Is that a problem? +++$+++ 2010s
Good to see you, son. +++$+++ 1980s
Sit down, man. Need a beer? +++$+++ 2000s
Yes -- yes indeed -- but you are a...  ...a stenographer. Don't little stenographers earn little pennies? +++$+++ 1930s
I don't mean everyone.  Just people who can do things because they can arrest people or convict them.  Or run a newspaper. +++$+++ 1990s
What's this? +++$+++ 1980s
Any old where ... but not our little Richard ... oh no! When you're not thumping them pagan skins, you're tormenting your eyes wid that rubbish! +++$+++ 1960s
With the forty thousand dollars? +++$+++ 1960s

Not even then. The police are the proper people to conduct this affair. Now if you've got any suspicions I'll drive you to the nearest police station. +++$+++ 1930s
Now you're going to have to tell me more. +++$+++ 2000s
I guess I don't have a hell of a lot of choice. +++$+++ 2000s
I'm sure this beautiful room must appeal to your taste -- distinctive, don't you think? Velvet upholstery -- 'A-number one'. I'm in the textile trade and I know.  And these are real silk drapes. +++$+++ 1930s
You'd better make a move kid.  He thinks you're trying to screw him. +++$+++ 1980s
Hello? +++$+++ 2000s
Well, we're FBI agents. +++$+++ 1990s
That woman's gonna call the cops. +++$+++ 2000s
I... +++$+++ 2000s
You fuckin' worm, if you're going out, I'm going out. +++$+++ 1980s
Why not? +++$+++ 1940s
What? +++$+++ 1960s
Isn't there something you... +++$+++ 1970s
There's only one Chinese restaurant in town, darling, the owners are Irish and Irish people happen to cook Cantonese.  They don't know better. +++$+++ 1980s
You weren't looking for company, were you? +++$+++ 1950s
Stop pointing your fuckin' gun at daddy! +++$+++ 1990s
I think you probably would -- if you didn't know I was right. +++$+++ 1990s
What things? +++$+++ 1980s
You're right.  I told you I was bad at acting. +++$+++ 1990s
What are you running away from? +++$+++ 1960s
Looks like... our old friend Mr. Codeine. That should take the pinch out of my ankle.  Have one. +++$+++ 2000s
I'm giving you Clint outside. +++$+++ 1990s
The Borg will undoubtedly attack. Set phasers to rotating modulation. +++$+++ 1990s
No.  I'm just depressed. +++$+++ 1980s
Sounds like you hooked up with some fine citizens, Flynne. +++$+++ 2000s
You're taking advantage of a minor. +++$+++ 1980s
Well, it's only the truth. There are horrible things in the world, Rose. +++$+++ 1990s
The paperwork, couldn't stand the paperwork.  Over to the left please, if you don't mind sir. Hold it there. Yes, there's more bits of paper in Central Services than bits of pipe - read this, fill in that, hand in the other - listen, this old system of yours could be on fire and I couldn't even turn on the kitchen tap without filling in a 27B/6.... Bloody paperwork. +++$+++ 1980s
He's right. +++$+++ 1990s
Of course I can. Drink or she dies.  Unlike you, she won't come back from where she's going. +++$+++ 2000s
And I do it because they do it, and they do it - it's a vicious circle, isn't it?  I'm going over to Georgie's, Brad - you know, Georgie, don't you? +++$+++ 1940s
You mad at me? +++$+++ 2000s
You expect him? +++$+++ 2000s
Paden. +++$+++ 1980s
The timing has never seemed quite right. +++$+++ 1990s
You're really pure, you know?  You got a perfect record.  You never used that stuff to ruin your body, why start now? +++$+++ 1970s
I don't know. +++$+++ 2000s
I didn't mean to start that.... +++$+++ 1980s
What is it? +++$+++ 2000s
Raise 300. +++$+++ 1970s
You're not a moron. +++$+++ 1990s
So you're Buzz's boy. I've been expecting you. You hurt my feelings when you didn't come and see me sooner. +++$+++ 1990s
Baxter, I picked you for my team because I thought you were a bright young man. You realize what you're doing? Not to me -- but to yourself. Normally it takes years to work your way up to the twenty-seventh floor -- but it takes only thirty seconds to be out on the street again. You dig? +++$+++ 1960s
No. +++$+++ 1970s
I know. Amazing. +++$+++ 1990s
And what makes you think you killed a man? +++$+++ 1980s
Jesus Christ, Michael, then let's hit 'em now, while we still got the muscle. +++$+++ 1970s
There, look! +++$+++ 1990s
Is it?  William says now you have requested a British Commission, why not colonial?  I'll clear it up for you, sir, because as a British officer you can lord over colonial yokels -- more than that, it will even get you into polite society! Your dream come true, George, the only dream that really matters to you. +++$+++ 2000s
Well, I think you're the fucking Anti-Christ. +++$+++ 2000s
They were ready to blame him for anything, no matter where it happened. +++$+++ 1990s
We did it.  We did it. +++$+++ 1990s
He's going to take his foot off slowly, David. Then you're to go home, like a good boy. You hear me? +++$+++ 1990s
If they don't take me out before then. [As an afterthought] What's the net? +++$+++ 2000s
I drew my gun, ran in the direction of the cries...violating the first rule of service...I let the Ambass- ador out of my sight. +++$+++ 2000s
We’ve got to get out. +++$+++ 1990s
Several problems with that theory. For one thing, this egg is intact. For another, according to Pendergast, the crates were shipped here on a boat.  Everyone on board was killed like Beauregard.  If the thing hatched in mid-ocean, where did it go? +++$+++ 1990s
Fit? You want to check my teeth.  Good crowd today. I think you'll have some fun. You going to stay for dinner? +++$+++ 1990s
Moishe, please, don't talk. +++$+++ 1990s
Yes. Yes, I'm here! +++$+++ 1990s
Much as I'd like to help you and our valued guests, I'm afraid I can't. +++$+++ 1990s
Because I took some sleeping pills. But I'm all right now -- so let's go. +++$+++ 1960s
We're focusing. +++$+++ 1970s
I never did.  Or the whole idea of an afterlife.  But I don't know any more.  I have these dreams about... your mom... and we have long talks about... about you, and how you are, which she sort of knows but I tell her anyway.  So what is that? It's sort of an afterlife, isn't it? +++$+++ 1990s
Let's go! +++$+++ 1990s
It's not like you laid the eggs yourself. +++$+++ 1990s
Seems to be back to normal, sir. +++$+++ 1990s
TALBY! +++$+++ 1970s
I'm usually nervous myself on first dates...but not tonight. It's funny, but somehow, I feel like....like I know you. +++$+++ 1980s
What's going on, Logan?! +++$+++ 1970s
Then the other Lyssa will share your fate. She will grow old in the Fortress as you have grown old here. +++$+++ 1980s
Never heard of him. +++$+++ 1990s
I haven't heard that song in ages.  The Ronettes? +++$+++ 1990s
I'd better press your evening clothes, sir.  You have not for- gotten Madame's New Year's party. +++$+++ 1950s
An Agent!  You have to send me back! +++$+++ 1990s
That doesn't sound so bad, come on, we'll never find that streamer. +++$+++ 1990s
Oh, I know, was it possibly when your ass was rotting in jail and I broke it out? Yeah, you're right, that was pretty fuckin' nutty. Not to mention stupid. But you know what? I can fix that right now. +++$+++ 1990s
I'd better go see how he's doing. +++$+++ 1970s
I'm fine. +++$+++ 1970s
You're in the Malahide Institute. It's a psychiatric hospital. But, hey, don't feel judged -- it was just the nearest place to bring you. Remember? You and your boyfriend...? +++$+++ 1980s
You say that like it's a bad thing. +++$+++ 1990s
Tonight? +++$+++ 1980s
You know him? +++$+++ 2000s
What is your name? +++$+++ 1970s
You're right, let's knock it down. +++$+++ 1990s
Well -- as I see it we've got two choices. We can hang around here and wait for the bomb to go off, or we can go to my party. +++$+++ 1970s
...is as dangerous as you seem to think it is, I'm gettin' my ass as far away from you and it as possible. +++$+++ 1990s
What do you mean? +++$+++ 1930s
Sam, I'm going. +++$+++ 1960s
Feel? I dunno... Happy. +++$+++ 1970s
Good idea. +++$+++ 1990s
I should like you to do something for me. It's an innocent sort of thing but I'm very set on it. +++$+++ 1960s
You were right about Joe, he is going somewhere -- +++$+++ 1990s
Madeleine, I... there are certain things... feelings... we must not voice. +++$+++ 2000s
Viva la Resistance. +++$+++ 1990s
Ten, nine... +++$+++ 1990s
Well, he passed on. He was killed in a motor accident in Italy. +++$+++ 1930s
See? +++$+++ 1950s
Hmmmm.  He'll be in the Zen Room. +++$+++ 1970s
No. You can't trust her. +++$+++ 1980s
Really? +++$+++ 1990s
What do you mean? +++$+++ 1990s
I suppose the idea was specialized training. +++$+++ 1960s
That's the way it was told to me. +++$+++ 1980s
Hooker! +++$+++ 1970s
I wouldn't wait if I were you. +++$+++ 1930s
Slower! In... Out... +++$+++ 1980s
I haven't seen you cry since you were a baby. This must be serious.  Where'd you meet him? +++$+++ 1930s
Oh -- all right. +++$+++ 1930s
Oh, no. Not Owens, not.... Wai', wai', wait. <u>I'm Owens</u>. Right? +++$+++ 2000s
I stand corrected Mr. Decker.  Navigator, lay in a conic section flight path into the cloud center; bring us parallel to whatever we find in there... +++$+++ 1970s
Stop it! I'm just trying to say I think we should take our friendship to the next level. +++$+++ 2000s
You actually said that?!  Haaaah!! +++$+++ 1990s
Well...I think you should feel very proud. You did a real nice thing for somebody else. I'm very proud. +++$+++ 1990s
The Sheriff has just received four more letters threatening his life, but he says nothing can interfere with his duty. +++$+++ 1940s
Do something... +++$+++ 1990s
That's why I'm calling, Miss Price... +++$+++ 1970s
And our people? +++$+++ 1990s
Magda! +++$+++ 1990s
Bela, what happened?! +++$+++ 1990s
What -- what are you doing? +++$+++ 1980s
We have to tell her she's in danger! +++$+++ 2000s
I need a cigarette!  She left my office four years ago, we're looking for a chart...  I need a cigarette... +++$+++ 1970s
Pressure? +++$+++ 1990s
You wouldn't believe me. I mean, people always say, "You wouldn't believe me", but in this case, it's not even worth trying. +++$+++ 2000s
You've got to pick three more numbers. +++$+++ 1980s
I was in the basement fixing the pipes.  Would you believe that? +++$+++ 1980s
Yeah. +++$+++ 1960s
No, Major, I merely wish to state that your vehicle appears to be somewhat slower and heavier than mine, and point out that, if you would be kind enough to pull over to one side of the road, I could pass you and be on my way. +++$+++ 1990s
Got to learn, like I'm a-learnin'. Don't know it right yet myself, but I'm tryin' to fin' out. That's why I can't ever be a preacher again. Preacher got to *know*.  I don't. I got to *ask*. +++$+++ 1940s
No, he's not. +++$+++ 1990s
That's the "why."  That's the why? There is no reason.  No good reason; no bad reason.  To live or to die. +++$+++ 2000s
Hurry up, would you? +++$+++ 1990s
Well, that's a load off. +++$+++ 1990s
Did they hurtcha? +++$+++ 1930s
Let me. +++$+++ 1980s
Mike? +++$+++ 1980s
Good swell. +++$+++ 1970s
So something please Doctor, Help her! +++$+++ 1970s
... was so romantic. +++$+++ 1990s
Yeah. This land to be bought by contributions from the boys. You have that. Money to be-- +++$+++ 1930s
I'm not hungry.  What's wrong?  I spent all morning on that soup.  I thought you liked Worm's Wart. +++$+++ 1990s
I said I wonder if you could help me. +++$+++ 1960s
Perfectionist. +++$+++ 1970s
Sit down, Gino! +++$+++ 1990s
I thought we were poor. +++$+++ 1980s
I made the CUT THE LINE gesture. You nodded okay.' +++$+++ 1990s
Willie, shut up.  Yo' old ass need to get in a little bit o' trouble sometimes. +++$+++ 2000s
It's for school, for summer writing class. +++$+++ 1990s
Cold. +++$+++ 2000s
A private investigator... You’re not Austrian? +++$+++ 1990s
Be that as it may. U is for Unconditional Election. God has chosen a certain number of people to be saved, The Elect, and He has chosen them from the beginning of time. L is for Limited Atonement. Only a limited number will be atoned, will go to Heaven. +++$+++ 1970s
I never really thought they'd go for it.  And then... you didn't come forward, they investigated my war record...  I kept expecting you to show up and expose me... +++$+++ 1990s
You're right.  I must've made a mistake. +++$+++ 2000s
Yes. +++$+++ 2000s
To begin, I put money out on the streets, chargin' three points a week. You know - juice to the fuckin' dealers. +++$+++ 1990s
Orvolle. His wine.  From now on, nothing but water at every meal -- +++$+++ 2000s
I know a very good dentist. +++$+++ 1940s
Yes you can. You're going to make it, Scully. +++$+++ 1990s
And give a deposition to the jUdge. +++$+++ 1990s
Somebody planted that fucking story! And somebody tipped off the press I'm one of Garrison's fucking suspects.  I can't go home. I'm out on the street.  The maggots are everywhere!  Do you know what you've done to me?  It's all over the national news now.  You know what you've done to me? +++$+++ 1990s
She could be under sedatives, sleeping.  He's in the room now. +++$+++ 1950s
Nothing. +++$+++ 1990s
How much do you make a week, Niki? +++$+++ 1970s
Pretty darn clear. +++$+++ 1990s
I love you, my little Leonitchka! +++$+++ 1930s
Where are we going? +++$+++ 2000s
That's wonderful. I think you should... fresh air. +++$+++ 1970s
But don't worry, man. Things are all sweetness and light here... +++$+++ 2000s
In the den. +++$+++ 1970s
Any sign of Lindenmeyer? +++$+++ 1990s
Shit!  He sent them all. +++$+++ 1980s
Good evening. You see, here we are again. +++$+++ 1940s
How far are you going to? +++$+++ 1970s
You're kidding yourself.  An adult T-rex cares about one thing -- filling its own belly.  It acts the way people wish they could, that's why everyone's fascinated by it.  If people had the chance to see one dinosaur and one only, ninety-nine percent would -- +++$+++ 1990s
I'm still here, Doc. +++$+++ 1970s
Fine, I'll stop. +++$+++ 1990s
I'm not worried about you.  I'm worried about the safe. +++$+++ 1980s
Why? +++$+++ 1990s
You what? +++$+++ 1930s
It's the tension. +++$+++ 1990s
Monica. +++$+++ 2000s
Why did you break into that particular building? +++$+++ 2000s
Gray -- I'm rid of him -- +++$+++ 1940s
Oh, now I'll never get home! +++$+++ 1930s
If this is meant to be a joke it is not funny. Or do you still think you're issuing orders from your palace in Petrograd? +++$+++ 1930s
No. I don't want it to. +++$+++ 2000s
I'll consider it. +++$+++ 1990s
Especially tenor sax.  I don't know what it is, but they just curdle me.  All they have to do is play eight bars of "Come to Me My Melancholy Baby" - and my spine turns to custard, and I get goose-pimply all over - and I come to them. +++$+++ 1950s
Look, you'll be back in town tomorrow night. We'll have dinner -- talk it over. +++$+++ 1980s
What would you say if you knew it was me who brought down Bill Parrish?  I told Drew and the Board that Bill depended on you.  Drew led me on, but I had no business telling him in the first place.  He was setting up Bill from day one.  Drew and Bontecou are going to chop up the company and sell it off for parts. Bontecou was outside, Drew was Mr. Inside.  And I was the fool who made it all happen.  Oh God, what do I do? +++$+++ 1990s
Maybe I just live here, what do you think about that? +++$+++ 1990s
Here? In Berkeley? +++$+++ 1960s
Fifty dollars? +++$+++ 1990s
Fifteen meters. +++$+++ 1980s
Amateurs! +++$+++ 1930s
Just doesn't, that's all. +++$+++ 1990s
Who did they get for that? +++$+++ 1990s
Zero emotional developments. Total lack of compassion. A highly developed psychopathic instinct to survive. +++$+++ 1990s
I got him in the stomach. +++$+++ 1970s
Don't rush ever'body, honey. +++$+++ 1990s
Any others? +++$+++ 1990s
Not so fast.  Who's that? +++$+++ 1990s
The Case that I am <u>working</u> on... +++$+++ 2000s
Will the Company put up five hundred dollars to get Jane McKenna's list of clients? +++$+++ 1970s
It's alright. +++$+++ 2000s
Here's what this is...ask how much they want to turn back to us our load... +++$+++ 2000s
That time you sent me up last ... I learned book-keeping at Sing Sing.  I figured it might be an in for me somewhere's. +++$+++ 1930s
Who is he, Pop? +++$+++ 1950s
Are you hungry?  What's your favorite food?  We'll try to get it for you. +++$+++ 1990s
Comrades! People of the world! The revolution is on the march... I know... wars will wash over us... bombs will fall... all civilization will crumble... but not yet, please... wait, wait... what's the hurry?  Let us be happy... give us our moment....  We are happy, aren't we, Leon? +++$+++ 1930s
Your mother wasn't one to get chased off her patch. Half the damn county knew and nobody thought the worse of her for seein' it through. +++$+++ 1990s
Why was the floor wet? +++$+++ 1990s
When can you leave? +++$+++ 2000s
Maybe Cotton Weary is telling the truth. Maybe he was having an affair with your mom. +++$+++ 1990s
Hola, bienvenido +++$+++ 1990s
Jesus, the road! +++$+++ 1980s
We can't really leave that poor man here alone. +++$+++ 1970s
So where is he? +++$+++ 1990s
Oh, excuse me.  This is -- uh -- this is -- +++$+++ 1990s
Mr. Carpenter -- what does velocity mean? +++$+++ 2000s
There was no ad in the Times. +++$+++ 2000s
I'm just like him. +++$+++ 1990s
Alright...alright...you've saved my ass enough times.  What do you want to do? +++$+++ 2000s
Quick! In the house. He won't look for us in there. +++$+++ 2000s
Are you her boyfriend? +++$+++ 1990s
What? +++$+++ 1980s
Getting there. +++$+++ 2000s
I think she's going to be all right. +++$+++ 1970s
I won't let him hurt you! He just wants what you know! +++$+++ 2000s
You've been out of your room. +++$+++ 1990s
How do I know if this is love ? +++$+++ 1990s
'Remembrance'. +++$+++ 1950s
He won't eh? - We'll see about that - send for your father immediately. +++$+++ 1930s
Well, where are you going? +++$+++ 1990s
Who are you going after next, sir? +++$+++ 1990s
Jack - - please - - WIPE THAT LUNATIC GRIN OFF YOUR FACE. +++$+++ 1980s
I like the sound of that. +++$+++ 2000s
Wha -- what do you want? +++$+++ 1960s
Oh, Letty, what happened? +++$+++ 2000s
Rogan, Laurel. You also have a Rogan, Lillian. She won't need it. Sell it. +++$+++ 2000s
So if you give us the pregnant lady's number, we can warn her about the lake and she'll live long enough to have the baby. +++$+++ 2000s
They coulda danced a jig on it an' fed it to goats -- don't matter.  Ya' can't kill Jason by gettin' rid of his body.  He'll come back the way he always do, to drag the kiddies into the darkness and crush their little skulls -- maybe even your skull, Mr. Campbell. +++$+++ 1990s
The chief says to tell you how sorry he is. He knew Sam Baffert was a good man. +++$+++ 1990s
Money isn't the only reason people commit murder, Miss Braslow. +++$+++ 1990s
Do you know what I'm looking at Robert? +++$+++ 1990s
Thank you, sir. +++$+++ 1930s
Are you crazy? I've unleashed a psycho on her. She's gonna be fucking pissed.  She's even more beautiful than I remember. +++$+++ 1990s
That happens. +++$+++ 1980s
I thought you'd be interested. I'd like you to be in on everything, Annie. Not just the finished book, but how it's written. +++$+++ 1990s
Bugger the Buffs. +++$+++ 1980s
Well, thanks for coming. +++$+++ 1990s
You're very direct, Mr. Felson. +++$+++ 1960s
I want to now who I'm talking to. +++$+++ 1990s
Do you swear on all the Holy Saints in heaven? +++$+++ 1990s
Only you think you're lucky because you didn't have a mother who said things to you and did things to you that maybe weren't always nice but that was because of me, because I was bad, not her. +++$+++ 1980s
What? +++$+++ 1990s
Maybe you need to start. +++$+++ 2000s
I've got something important to do. I can't leave. +++$+++ 1970s
Oh, Jesus, come on, will you? Don't mess this up anymore than it's already been messed up. Join the other kids. Do that and before you know it you'll be as happy as a goddamned clam. +++$+++ 1990s
I wish you'd tell Alice that.  And that Goddamn Mrs. Wheeler. +++$+++ 1970s
I strongly doubt it, but I wasn't really discussing media... +++$+++ 1970s
You're no Venus de Milo. +++$+++ 1940s
Ohhhh -- +++$+++ 1930s
What'd you see, who was she with, where were they going? +++$+++ 2000s
Who knows? Guys a lot smarter than me are dropping out like flies. +++$+++ 1980s
L.A. is in a constant state of warfare. Gangs fighting for the right to rule. +++$+++ 1990s
You can't fight'em that way... +++$+++ 1990s
Just for the criminals. +++$+++ 1990s
Oh Lord! I'd do just about anything for that! +++$+++ 1990s
What is it? Where's Casey? +++$+++ 1990s
Where are you going?! +++$+++ 1980s
You mean besides kicking your ass?! +++$+++ 1990s
I have little time for your mercenary concerns, but I am grateful for the service you have given to our cause.  What is your price? +++$+++ 1970s
Baby, you're so money you don't even know it. +++$+++ 1990s
Twombley's shot. I heard that. Not Jack. He's okay, I assume. +++$+++ 1990s
Nonsense!  You look great --  Look, uh, why don't you lie down and take a little nap?  We'll film around you for a while. +++$+++ 1990s
Some meeting.  With PG&E people. +++$+++ 2000s
No!  Cocoa Puffs on Top -- Fruit Loops on the bottom. +++$+++ 1990s
This isn't me.  We can show clients endless options, change anything in a matter of hours on the computer.  But you won't change. +++$+++ 2000s
I am a fool. +++$+++ 1990s
Christ, Ted, I was only four towns away. +++$+++ 1990s
Through the ass. +++$+++ 1970s
Was that it? +++$+++ 1990s
Just ask if they can recall recommending my services to anyone in the recent past. Say you’re my secretary, all right? +++$+++ 1990s
How long were you having sex with him? +++$+++ 1990s
He's in Engineering, sir...  He doesn't know. +++$+++ 1970s
Was she ever a suspect? +++$+++ 1990s
He's my son. +++$+++ 1990s
Whatta we do now? +++$+++ 2000s
How about yourself? +++$+++ 1990s
Hi. Is Annette at home? +++$+++ 1990s
Transference! +++$+++ 1990s
That is you there, ain't it, Bob? The Duck of Death? +++$+++ 1990s
A headache? +++$+++ 1990s
Who cares? +++$+++ 1990s
Oh my God, sir! +++$+++ 1990s
I'm sorry, Neil. +++$+++ 1980s
Do you have great devotion for the Virgin? +++$+++ 1960s
I won't ask why you would want to help someone trying to kill you, but hey, good job.  Shall we? +++$+++ 1990s
Who?  Where d'you think they come from! +++$+++ 1950s
Well then, I suggest you have a seat on the bench behind you and think of something a little juicier to confess than losing KISS tickets. I realize this is Detroit, but I personally find, what that rock and roll band is all about, to be boring as Lucifer's kingdom. I'll return in a little while. +++$+++ 1990s
He's a Selectman. The town. He said to tell you to turn your badge in and clean out your office. I'm supposed to pull the CB and police light out of your car. They're town property. +++$+++ 1990s
No thanks. +++$+++ 1970s
Yes, very cosy for a family, and if you feel like spreading out you have the rest of the hotel to move around in. +++$+++ 1980s
What an awful sound! +++$+++ 1970s
No! They said no cops! They were darned clear on that, Wade! They said you call the cops and we - +++$+++ 1990s
I had to be the ham! I had to shoot off my mouth! +++$+++ 1950s
I'll take some. +++$+++ 1980s
No, no, please! +++$+++ 1990s
Yes. Why? +++$+++ 1960s
Oh. Carrots.  And peas.  None of the important ones. +++$+++ 1980s
Took it out the bathroom window. Buried it in the woods. +++$+++ 1990s
She'll drive herself. +++$+++ 2010s
Well, if you change your mind. What's this friend's name? +++$+++ 1980s
Nobody just scuttles a passenger liner either. +++$+++ 2000s
1961?  '62?  Mary Clarence, that's when many of us took final vows.  It's the last secular music we recall. +++$+++ 1990s
I wouldn't know who to bet on. +++$+++ 2000s
Would you like to have a cool drink, David? +++$+++ 1970s
You shouldn't a done that. +++$+++ 2000s
Yeah. +++$+++ 2000s
Come on, Jean. Get rid of your cigarette. Concentrate. +++$+++ 1990s
<u>Do</u> it... +++$+++ 2000s
EVERYBODY SHUT UP! Let the man speak. +++$+++ 1990s
...-lem? +++$+++ 1990s
Oh, that's nice-- +++$+++ 1990s
He's doing his best. +++$+++ 1980s
Would you like to know what's in it? The report. +++$+++ 1970s
Open the door. We're late. +++$+++ 1990s
No. This is nothing, Dewey. I'll be okay. Go back to work and let me get back to my quasi pseudo-happy existence. +++$+++ 1990s
Where does he work? +++$+++ 2000s
We are in a dungeon. How do we get out? +++$+++ 1980s
Just horseshit luck. +++$+++ 1990s
A script!  I thought we just walked through everything... +++$+++ 1990s
"Fun?"  Jesus, "<u>fun</u>?"  I kill myself for a year and a half, hand you the best case of your life on a God damn silver platter, remind you of why you became a lawyer in the first place, and you think of me as "fun?" +++$+++ 2000s
Jeff--this is Mr. Taylor. +++$+++ 1930s
You're a good man... She was right to have chosen you... +++$+++ 1990s
Mister, I'm calling you out. +++$+++ 1990s
I know. Don't tell me. It was a wonderful party. Your suit went over big. And she looked beautiful, and she gave her hand when you left her-- and said--"Thank you, Mr. Smith." Oh, but it was the way she *said* it. You like to fell through the floor--Horseradish! +++$+++ 1930s
You didn't know she had a boyfriend? +++$+++ 1990s
Daddy, *please*... +++$+++ 1990s
Yes, Mrs. Pressman. +++$+++ 1990s
I already have. +++$+++ 1990s
Guess what I am holding in my hand. You like guessing games? +++$+++ 2000s
You shot Roger. +++$+++ 1980s
They're comin' with us. +++$+++ 1990s
Natalie who? +++$+++ 2000s
Talk. Lovers murmuring to each other... +++$+++ 1980s
Oh my God! You're Rick Derris? +++$+++ 1990s
How are we going to find her?  There must be thousands of white vans in this state. +++$+++ 2000s
No. Stay. I want you close to me. This couch is wrong. It's not a "married couch." +++$+++ 2000s
I'm Bobby Clowes. Kansas City. +++$+++ 1990s
The speeders should be ready in the morning.  They'll make the search easier. +++$+++ 1980s
Happy anniversary. +++$+++ 2000s
What if <u>what</u>? +++$+++ 1990s
Look, I know why you like him. I know why everyone likes him. But I need you to tell me I'm not crazy. +++$+++ 2000s
I'm a pilot, Will. This is where I belong. +++$+++ 1990s
Get off the radio! +++$+++ 1990s
I made an appointment with Father Phillip McNulty at St. Bernard's. We're to see him directly where he will register you on the spot. +++$+++ 1990s
Oh god. I'm overbearing and rude. Lily. Lily Finn. +++$+++ 2000s
There's sort of a built-in prayer for the sick man to get well, but of course that's not the basic intention. +++$+++ 1970s
Look kid, I know what it's like, I was a kid, too.  Even stole a Horse once.  But you can't-- +++$+++ 1990s
Bubba. +++$+++ 2000s
Jessie!  Are you alright? +++$+++ 1990s
Yes, Dr Scott.  A laser capable of emitting a beam of pure anti-matter. +++$+++ 1970s
Yeah, well, that's enough. +++$+++ 2000s
How old are you? +++$+++ 1950s
Man! Our first date and already you're trying to get me to change! You French women work quick! +++$+++ 1990s
"Fuck"? You think I don't know this word "fuck"? Is that how you talk to policemen in America? +++$+++ 1990s
Mr. Decker... I will contact you every five minutes. Otherwise... inform Mr. Scott immediately. +++$+++ 1970s
Why? +++$+++ 1990s
Carl's a jerk! +++$+++ 1990s
What'd I say? +++$+++ 2000s
I can't do it. +++$+++ 2000s
The public demands justice, sir. This was a full-fledged riot of policemen.  Shift the guilt to men whose pensions are secured.  Force them to retire.  But someone has to swing.  Indict, try and convict Stensland and Bud White.  Secure them jail time.  Feed them to the sharks, sir.  Protect yourself; protect the department. +++$+++ 1990s
I didn't realise! Those were de-caps! I didn't know that....de-caps... revived! +++$+++ 1980s
Ah. +++$+++ 1990s
That's right. Not my style, Reggie.. +++$+++ 1980s
All right, folks, get on your mark. When you hear the pistol shot-- +++$+++ 1930s
I am sure.  I mean to report it. It's like Burke and Hare all over again. +++$+++ 1940s
I want to wake up. I want to wake up, that's all. I-- +++$+++ 1980s
Boy, if we were inside, I know how to forge us a Group 6 access... +++$+++ 1980s
Hold your arm out. You can't hope to be cured quickly. You heard what the doctor said. If it had been seen to in time ...This'll take time. But with the help of God, we'll pull through. +++$+++ 1960s
You don't have fifty foot of apartment! +++$+++ 2000s
You want to do this some other time? +++$+++ 2000s
We'll bury him. +++$+++ 1990s
I inherited that money when I was thirteen, when my father died. +++$+++ 1990s
I know my treasure. +++$+++ 1990s
Waitaminit, dudes! I got it! Maybe we can glue the tickets back together! +++$+++ 1990s
Hey. I said what I saw. Two kids arguing. A guy and a girl. +++$+++ 2000s
My job, my rules. We've got a job to do. No mixing business and pleasure. +++$+++ 1990s
Your Honor: I imagine that, no matter how careful my questioning, Mr. Ortega would, in his well-intentioned way, dig my client's hole even deeper. +++$+++ 1980s
Well put. So, what exactly has uncle Terrence been up to lately? +++$+++ 1990s
I'm buying bananas tonight. +++$+++ 1990s
You said it. +++$+++ 1980s
I wasn't sneaking around with your girl.  Would you please tell him? +++$+++ 1970s
Where the hell is he? +++$+++ 1980s
Johnny Cammareri. I think it's great and about time. What's she gonna do with the rest of her life she don't get married? +++$+++ 1980s
Oh please. You're blind as a bat. +++$+++ 1990s
You can tie whoever did it to Sandra Van Ryan... +++$+++ 1990s
I don't like her. +++$+++ 1990s
I'll get it for you. Ibuprofen or aspirin? +++$+++ 2000s
We can't just go off and-- +++$+++ 1990s
Good night. +++$+++ 1990s
She didn't like me... I made a fool of myself... +++$+++ 1990s
That's horseshit and you know it. +++$+++ 2000s
-- no. +++$+++ 1990s
I'm a junior. +++$+++ 2000s
Good thing you have a voice-over career. +++$+++ 2000s
Isn't it a bit too late to be out? You've brought me the sword? +++$+++ 2000s
What's the matter? Afraid papa will spank? +++$+++ 1930s
Mom, this is the guy that drove us home that afternoon we were stuck on the highway. The guy you yelled at for no good reason... +++$+++ 2000s
Every other Sunday.  I'm heavyweight champion of the West Virginia. +++$+++ 2000s
Forget it.  I was reading. +++$+++ 1980s
Yes. +++$+++ 1990s
Don't you think that's a little psycho? A little weird? +++$+++ 1990s
Bill, thanks for coming over...  And how're you doing today, Drew?  You've got a firecracker here, the kid's really set the table. +++$+++ 1990s
You want 'em all arrested? +++$+++ 1950s
Otho, that's terrible. +++$+++ 1980s
Well, this one's yours now. You ready to take care of it? +++$+++ 2000s
What happened with Rick? +++$+++ 1940s
I have no idea what to say. How to act. What if I do the wrong thing? +++$+++ 2000s
I could see she likes you. +++$+++ 1950s
I'm gonna propose. +++$+++ 2000s
Who's setting you up in this place? +++$+++ 2000s
No comment! +++$+++ 1990s
Wait a minute. +++$+++ 1990s
So you're a one-girl guy? +++$+++ 1990s
We're just talking about the... +++$+++ 2000s
Zat what it takes?  I always <u>wondered</u> what it took... +++$+++ 2000s
I know what he'll say.  He'll say that acting is just a whim and that it's frivolous and that I should forget about it.  He'll tell me how they're counting on me and to put it out of my mind "for my own good." +++$+++ 1980s
Hey, you going to watch or you going to do? +++$+++ 1990s
They haven't done the standard scratch test. Where they make small injections into the skin? +++$+++ 1990s
That checks out with our finding, thank you, Mr. Dahlberg. +++$+++ 1970s
OK. Same again? +++$+++ 1990s
Yeah? +++$+++ 1980s
I know. +++$+++ 1980s
I teach part time at the Junior College.  What if I told you I was through with Nuke?  He learned his lessons quickly and left me. +++$+++ 1980s
I'm sorry. +++$+++ 1990s
Yes. It's very cold outside today, isn't it, Thomas? +++$+++ 1970s
Yes I do. +++$+++ 2000s
Look, if you don't mind, I haven't got time to listen to the whole plot ... +++$+++ 1950s
Why is your beard so funny? Let me touch this. +++$+++ 1990s
Can you tell her I'll ring her back. +++$+++ 1990s
Well . . . uh . . . I . . . +++$+++ 1930s
Hey... what the hell you doing? +++$+++ 1990s
We can't fire, sir; they've damaged the photon controls and the warp drive. We must withdraw! +++$+++ 1980s
Now, find your power animal. +++$+++ 1990s
What's ailing that dog? +++$+++ 2000s
Books, records, films -- these things matter.  Call me shallow but it's the damn truth, and by this measure I was having one of the best dates of my life. +++$+++ 2000s
I understand you perfectly. You leave that girl alone, you wretched man, or you will be sorry. +++$+++ 1990s
Like what. +++$+++ 1990s
We'd better get everybody online.  And Kyle, Stop downloading porn.  Your frame rate is unacceptable. +++$+++ 1990s
Ho -- ho --ho +++$+++ 1930s
Take a look. Son of a bitch won't feel a thing until it's too late. +++$+++ 1980s
Not an option. Just get up slowly like everything's cool. Petra, trust me. You just hung yourself out to dry for me, I'm not gonna let you down. +++$+++ 2000s
It's a Movado. +++$+++ 1970s
Okay!  Look, Buffy.  You want to play house with the unwashed masses, that's fine.  But personally, I think you ought to spend a little time prioritizing.  I really do. +++$+++ 1990s
Then go get him. +++$+++ 1980s
Maybe you should just drop us off. I'm sure we can find someone willing to take the risk. +++$+++ 1970s
I won't panic. +++$+++ 1970s
Oh, babe... +++$+++ 1980s
Our 'kind'?  What is that supposed to mean?  These men are all I have left and they stay because they will fight!  They desire it!  They seek it!  Of course Virginia is terrified!  For my soldiers this is a war to obliterate the 'upper class' from the face of the earth! Should I tell them all to go home because if they win it will ruin me!?  It is impossible for me to imagine that Negroes are fighting so that only white men may be free! If we win this war they will own this country too! +++$+++ 2000s
...they treat me like a <u>child</u>.  I, I...to bare my <u>body</u>. +++$+++ 2000s
My subscription lapsed three years ago... +++$+++ 1970s
Sportsmanship! That's my point. June fly, Ed? Mosquito? Which of these? Well, what fish do you seek? +++$+++ 2000s
...that changes all my plans, I thought you were loaded... +++$+++ 1980s
-- All right. I tried to reason with you. I tried everything. Now I want those letters. Get them for me. +++$+++ 1940s
Haven't you been listening? +++$+++ 1980s
But you're troubled... aren't you? +++$+++ 1980s
That's pretty. +++$+++ 1930s
Who is he? +++$+++ 1990s
If you are killed in the Matrix, you die here? +++$+++ 1990s
If only Brad could have found it within his heart to say these things to me. +++$+++ 1980s
Oh, baby, you cruel... +++$+++ 1990s
An experiment? Hey, I've seen you before. +++$+++ 1980s
You're welcome to join our club. +++$+++ 1990s
I think I'll...carry him. +++$+++ 1970s
Stupid cunt! +++$+++ 1990s
Heck, you don't know! You're just whistlin' Dixie here! I'm sayin', the cops, they can advise us on this! I'm sayin' call a professional! +++$+++ 1990s
One thousand feet.  Pull the goddamn cord! +++$+++ 1990s
I can't. +++$+++ 1990s
You stole her purse!  While you were saving her? +++$+++ 1990s
I need to ask you questions of a psychological nature. +++$+++ 1980s
A little birdie whispered in my ear today... about the needle-candy you're chasing.  It's up here...  ... in the old curiosity shop. +++$+++ 2000s
It's a secret so don't tell anyone. Some day I'll show you where. I've gotta go to sleep now. +++$+++ 1980s
That's when I'll get my confidence back. +++$+++ 1970s
She's prepared to testify that she was instructed to do this by one of Edgar Sonrisa's managers.  You know who Sonrisa is? +++$+++ 1990s
Because she'll scare them away. +++$+++ 1990s
Hawk? +++$+++ 1990s
I'd better get going, do you need a hand to get into bed? +++$+++ 2000s
I mean -- on account of that policeman last night.  You think he's a bank robber, maybe? Or a gangster? +++$+++ 2000s
You shouldn't say that, you're the chairman --  ...uh, chairperson... +++$+++ 1980s
There's no joy in it for me. +++$+++ 2000s
No, I mean, is he trustworthy? Is his word -- +++$+++ 1940s
... taking Genesis away from us... +++$+++ 1980s
That sounds like a curse to me. +++$+++ 1980s
Leggo. I got to wash it out. +++$+++ 1990s
No.  I paid him off. +++$+++ 1990s
He's not home. +++$+++ 1940s
Don't give me that shit. I want my money. +++$+++ 1990s
I can make this wall without -- +++$+++ 1990s
Why?  Why, because you only told me about it? +++$+++ 1990s
How are you feeling, Norman? +++$+++ 1990s
It's the guard in the storeroom. +++$+++ 1980s
You've used up your grant. The electric bills alone exceed your annual salary.  Not to mention the potential hazards of your radioactive fuel. +++$+++ 2000s
Four seconds from... +++$+++ 1990s
Down... there. +++$+++ 1980s
What are you talking about? +++$+++ 1980s
Oh Brad. +++$+++ 1970s
Come on, Phil.  You're not gonna let this slide.  What about her parents?  What about what else she's published?  At least we should get the stuff to see if we find anything else that's an amazing real-life coincidence. +++$+++ 1990s
You wasn't with her? +++$+++ 1980s
What else can they do? +++$+++ 2000s
Brain injury. +++$+++ 1960s
Like a party for all our friends. +++$+++ 1990s
The air's laced with type two ozone, it reads as a solid. +++$+++ 2000s
Hang tough, Lloyd. +++$+++ 1980s
You could put it that way. +++$+++ 2000s
Wait. Don't draw any conclusions. Let me explain. +++$+++ 1940s
They always say that. +++$+++ 2000s
Go on, please -- five men -- $250,000 -- the French Underground -- +++$+++ 1960s
Separate bathrooms, darling. I will not lay out all my cosmetics for you to knock over. +++$+++ 1990s
What's the timer set for? +++$+++ 1980s
Too late. I've tried. I think you're right, Jake. I'm game. +++$+++ 1990s
And you ended up at UC Berkely -- +++$+++ 1990s
Shakespeare was French! The Queen Mother sucks cocks in hell! Shit! Fuck! Piss! +++$+++ 1980s
Not likely.  Once, yeah, I was -- but there wasn't an inch of profit in it, and I'm a cash oriented girl, if you take my meaning.  I'm a hired gun, same as the rest of you, and that's all any of us needs to know about the other. +++$+++ 1990s
Got it. +++$+++ 1990s
Never thought that pissant town would look so pretty. +++$+++ 2000s
Makes you cry +++$+++ 1970s
No. +++$+++ 1990s
Do tell. I love a good plan. +++$+++ 1990s
Yes, I understand. +++$+++ 1990s
Champagne please. +++$+++ 1990s
It was very well—hidden. There was no way to see it until it was too late. +++$+++ 1990s
... and you knew about this. +++$+++ 1990s
I'm coming up there Tim! I'm coming to get you!  Lex, I've got to get him! +++$+++ 1990s
Man, somebody really hung one on you!  I've heard some good ones for you guys... Humphrey Bogart, Harley Davidson.  I guess the people at immigration got a little punchy after a while, coming up with names for a quarter of a million of you. You weren't at the back of the line, were you, George? +++$+++ 1980s
But there's another side-- +++$+++ 1990s
These observers were doing something. A test...I think they sank that ship on purpose to cover up their mistakes. +++$+++ 1980s
Trust is earned not given away. +++$+++ 2000s
I come from a big one.  Nine of us. All in Minnesota, except me. +++$+++ 1950s
And sir, I also get that broken- mirror, black-cat, Friday-the- thirteenth kind of feeling about this one.... +++$+++ 1990s
Ok. +++$+++ 2000s
I'll be waiting.							   * +++$+++ 2000s
Jacob.  We've got to get to Amanda before it's too late. +++$+++ 1980s
Look, Todd, you're obviously under- estimating the value of this desk set. +++$+++ 1980s
Well, isn't this perhaps a good opportunity to... slip her one? +++$+++ 1990s
... Me, too. +++$+++ 1980s
How about once more around the park? +++$+++ 1960s
You're a menace! A walking pestilence. I do know who you are, Taylor. As I know that others of your kind must live in the Forbidden Zone.  You have just six hours to make a full confession. After that I'll employ surgery to obtain one.  Guards! +++$+++ 2000s
Do I? +++$+++ 2000s
They always let felons sit in on Honors Biology? +++$+++ 1990s
Y'see? That's the real point here. That's what I'm driving for, when the big storm comes and knocks down all the forests and the rocks fall down and the leave's are bare. What's left? The little trees, the little fellas that the storm didn't see. The tiny little... +++$+++ 1990s
He's a <u>bum</u>. +++$+++ 1990s
Oh Burke! Poor Burke! +++$+++ 1970s
Maybe they had weight limits, you don't know. +++$+++ 2000s
My pa wants to know...<U>Colonel</U> <U>Greenhill</U> wants to know how soon you could put a company of your Rangers in the field, fully armed and equipped, for joint punitive action against the Comanches. +++$+++ 1950s
I gave all that up.  I got tired of the lies. They wanted to stuff me in Levenworth to cover their asses on a botched assignment.  It got so I didn't know who to trust anymore...  ...some things never change, I guess. +++$+++ 2000s
Stop worrying, Deke. She was in a boat. +++$+++ 1960s
You haven't told then, huh? +++$+++ 1990s
We decided the night before last, before we came up here... +++$+++ 1950s
My pleasure. +++$+++ 1980s
Yeah, yeah, yeah. +++$+++ 1990s
In the lab.  With her, probably. +++$+++ 2000s
The killer leaves a newspaper clipping at each murder, Sidney. Recently he's also left a photo of your mother. +++$+++ 2000s
Yeah.  So how are you? +++$+++ 1970s
No, I don't belong here. +++$+++ 1970s
You got that right.  And we ain't brothers.  Maybe we should just end this right here. +++$+++ 2000s
Keep her out of here while I check it out. +++$+++ 1990s
Did he -- you know? +++$+++ 1990s
Comes with some Goddamn responsibility, like keeping your people in line. +++$+++ 2000s
You really want to know? +++$+++ 1990s
It's complicated and I don't want to go into it now, because it's bound to sound insulting--even though nobody means for anybody to be insulted.  It's just the truth. +++$+++ 1970s
It isn't Yankee whisky, Daddy, it's Scotch. +++$+++ 1990s
You know, I've always been fascinated by show business. +++$+++ 1950s
Does that worry you? +++$+++ 1970s
Somebody told her. +++$+++ 1980s
So alone. +++$+++ 1930s
Ha ha.  That's too much, Georgie.  Those days are over.  The rate is one-thousand dollars.  Inflation, you know? +++$+++ 2000s
...Yah -- well, at least, y'know, I got to perform. And Mom got to see me.  I guess number eight only worked for Diane Sawyer... +++$+++ 1990s
Full sentences.  As if she had been speaking all along. +++$+++ 2000s
Yes. +++$+++ 1990s
You hungry, son? +++$+++ 2000s
Hurry, Suzette. +++$+++ 1930s
You were not dead before. When I thought you dead, I did not care about all the plays that will never come, only that I would never see your face. I saw our end, and it will come. +++$+++ 1990s
You need not worry...Not just now, anyway. +++$+++ 1960s
For now the best thing we can do is to keep quiet about this. +++$+++ 2000s
I didn't know how to tell you.  A couple brokers stopped in for Stoley Spritzers one night.  Next thing I know Fast Track Digest votes us "Watering Hole of the Month."  Now, I'm shopping for Aqua Salmon wallpaper. +++$+++ 1990s
It's got into the pub!  It's turned on the stereo! +++$+++ 1980s
I was just about to ask Hanna to bring down iced tea.  I'd like it very much if you'd join me. +++$+++ 1990s
And what was that? +++$+++ 2000s
Sneaking in the back door. +++$+++ 1970s
Leave it -- I'll wash it for you. +++$+++ 1990s
Dr. Weir's right. Get on board the Event Horizon. I'll meet you at the airlock. +++$+++ 1990s
One. It's Ru'afo. +++$+++ 1990s
Well, don't worry.  I won't sue you - no matter who you are. +++$+++ 1950s
Charmed. +++$+++ 1980s
Aye, sir. +++$+++ 1990s
I just got here myself, Susan. +++$+++ 1990s
Wrong. +++$+++ 1980s
You pack a gun? +++$+++ 1990s
Why can't you be nice to me? +++$+++ 2000s
WILL YOU PLEASE... please listen to me ...  You know none of this is true -                           PARRY the Grail, the voices...                           Jack... There's a part of you that                         Come on...what are knows this isn't true.                             saying... I know who you are...                              I know who you are.. or who you were.                                   You're acting really- You don't belong on the                            No, no, no, no... streets. You're intelligent                        Jack... man....you're a teacher...                         Jacck!... You were a teach at Hunter College. Don't you remember?... +++$+++ 1990s
What'd you give for that thing? +++$+++ 2000s
I'm the coach! +++$+++ 1970s
Based on what my client would have earned over the next three years, including benefits and projected raises, and the extraordinary cost of medical care for someone with Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome... We would settle today for the very fair amount of one million five hundred thousand dollars. +++$+++ 1990s
No. +++$+++ 1960s
Yes. +++$+++ 1990s
Meet Col -- +++$+++ 1990s
I'm afraid to let you think, Junior. Things get worse when you think.  Oh, that's gonna help. +++$+++ 2000s
Of course not ... +++$+++ 1970s
You -- you -- +++$+++ 1940s
You don't think of me that way, do you? +++$+++ 1990s
Are you talking to me! +++$+++ 1930s
I designed it myself.  What'll it be... a face job or a full-body job? +++$+++ 1970s
You're fucking me. +++$+++ 1990s
Don't rub it in. +++$+++ 1930s
Try to think what it was. +++$+++ 1980s
Hey, no kidding?  In color? +++$+++ 1990s
No! Sit down now. +++$+++ 2000s
It doesn't take this. +++$+++ 1990s
Somethin' mighty fishy about this trail, Uncle Ethan... +++$+++ 1950s
Goddamn! +++$+++ 1990s
Who is it? +++$+++ 1970s
Five months. I love it. +++$+++ 2000s
You're surrendering. +++$+++ 2000s
Yes -- +++$+++ 1930s
You're a family man, Frankie? +++$+++ 2000s
The dockhand guy. Hanging by his neck from up there. +++$+++ 1990s
Oh. +++$+++ 1970s
Well, we're not discussing Rachel's age either. +++$+++ 1990s
I kiss you on the brain in the shadow of a train. I kiss you all starryeyed, my body's swinging from side to side. I don't see what anyone can see, in anyone else but you. +++$+++ 2000s
I told you, try to stay calm.  You're supposed to be the psychologist of the bunch. +++$+++ 2000s
Yes, I was in the war. +++$+++ 1930s
...Figured I'd better leave before I used it on him. I don't know how you can stand him. +++$+++ 1980s
Oh, no, really, I -- +++$+++ 1990s
Yes. +++$+++ 1960s
You can't tell your parents. +++$+++ 2000s
No -- what? +++$+++ 1940s
--listen, I love this country, you think I want to bring it down?--I'm not some goddamn zany, I was a hawk-- +++$+++ 1970s
Asshole!? I'm not the rope-totin' Charlie Bronson wanna-be that's getting' us lost! +++$+++ 1990s
It could be parasites, an infection... +++$+++ 1990s
That won't be necessary.  Sooner or later I knew you'd crack this thing, Max.  You got me. +++$+++ 2010s
None of the ID photos match the enhancement. +++$+++ 1990s
Yeah, they got a convention for everything. At least he was clean.  Boy, the guys I met when I was with the service, you wouldn't believe.  The older ones, they were okay.  Nice.  Polite.  Pulled the chair out for you.  But the younger ones ...  Mama used to say, dance with a man once, but if you can feel calluses on his fingers, don't dance with him again.  She thought she had it all figured out. But she wasn't so smart.  There are killers with palms like a baby. +++$+++ 1980s
Oh, don't go. +++$+++ 1930s
How many in your family? +++$+++ 2000s
Here's your check, my boy.  Thank you. +++$+++ 1980s
I am? I mean why? +++$+++ 1970s
The name's Rico, at my own father's grave, a man deserves some respect. +++$+++ 1960s
Very good.  You ought to have that printed up on your business card. +++$+++ 1990s
I will not approve it. +++$+++ 1990s
'82. +++$+++ 1990s
-- Skip. Knowing what you do about me -- +++$+++ 1990s
I wonder if he's some kind of mutant.  That bear had to be surprised. +++$+++ 1990s
And why would she do that? +++$+++ 1990s
Is she alright? +++$+++ 2000s
I think you do, yes. +++$+++ 1990s
Which floor? +++$+++ 1990s
Wait. I have Mr. Grocer for you. +++$+++ 1990s
I can’t stay here. +++$+++ 1990s
Thanks. +++$+++ 1990s
They're back! +++$+++ 1960s
What's it like where I'm going? +++$+++ 1990s
I don't believe you. +++$+++ 1960s
At least our obituaries will be accurate.  That's reassuring. +++$+++ 1990s
So.  Where have you been staying for the last week? +++$+++ 2000s
It was just a little going-away gesture. +++$+++ 2000s
I need the money. +++$+++ 1990s
Just five or six people. +++$+++ 1970s
I'll get us out of here. I really will. But if we don't play along we could alter their whole existence. We may never get home. +++$+++ 1990s
Most natural thing in the world! +++$+++ 1930s
I stay in my own yard. +++$+++ 1940s
I have my reasons. +++$+++ 1990s
This is the police, ma'am. +++$+++ 1990s
What is it?  What's the matter? +++$+++ 1970s
Two. +++$+++ 1990s
Why don’t you let me take this one, Kenny? +++$+++ 2000s
If I could get to the bridge I could send the distress signal. +++$+++ 1990s
So some people need different kinds of "convincing" than others....  Hey, just sign the petition! +++$+++ 1980s
How come her to keep bein' girlfriends and all with him if he's mean to her? +++$+++ 1990s
Certainly, sir. +++$+++ 1990s
Sit down and eat--you'll be late. +++$+++ 1950s
Wait!  I've waited seven years already!  How much longer do you want me to wait? +++$+++ 1990s
I thought you told me you didn't know where she was. +++$+++ 1940s
Why are you here? Why didn't you die? +++$+++ 2000s
Music, of course. To get a sweetheart, one has to look around, but to get a radio, all you have to do is buy one. +++$+++ 1960s
No. But it's weird. She seemed to recognize me. +++$+++ 2000s
He said he'll pick it up in a couple of days. +++$+++ 1990s
Wouldn't you like to meet him? +++$+++ 2000s
Hey...  I can't control it.  It's just, something that happened. +++$+++ 1990s
Do you know how to change a tire? +++$+++ 1990s
I swear to God. Sometimes he barks. I can hear him straight off my arm. Ruff, ruff, he goes. +++$+++ 1990s
But there is another entrance to this place. +++$+++ 1980s
I've pulled out my - uh wooden shoe and Starfleet is screaming for us to return to port. +++$+++ 1990s
Look, honey. We run the pipes through here, and we connect with the main water line here. +++$+++ 1930s
Mister Worf... find Data if you can, but your top priority is isolating the Borg. +++$+++ 1990s
Let's see how much he wants to play. +++$+++ 1990s
Physically, it's not a very demanding job.  The only thing that can get a bit trying up here during the winter is eh... the tremendous sense of isolation. +++$+++ 1980s
The Church is a fucking racket. I know how they operate. I've been part of the racket since the first time some faggot priest spilt water on my head. My Aunt Lu says I was crying all the way through. Yeah, I know their game inside out. Now I'm free of it and I'm gonna stay that way. +++$+++ 1990s
'We will remove the iron stove -- the one that was camouflaging the trap door.' +++$+++ 1950s
Greer's gone. He broke out of the tank. +++$+++ 2000s
I don't know, Grady. I just dropped him on a corner. +++$+++ 2000s
And after that we'll play the Abduction and cruel rape of Lucretia ... And I'll play Lucretia. +++$+++ 1960s
A son is a poor substitute for a lover. +++$+++ 1960s
Hey, Terry, guess who's here... that joker from the Commission... . +++$+++ 1950s
It's called Murderland. It's paid for by First Bank. +++$+++ 2000s
You're not going unless your sister goes.  End of story. +++$+++ 1990s
Me, I'm riding along, minding my own business. Four cowboys come by and we decide to ride together for a while, friendly as can be. I always figure you might as well approach life like everybody's your friend or nobody is... don't make much difference. We get out in the middle of that frying pan and suddenly everybody's pointing their gun but me. I guess they admired my horse. She's a great one, a sweet little bay. +++$+++ 1980s
Oh yeah - sure... okay. +++$+++ 1990s
I told you to lock the door. +++$+++ 1990s
Brains aren't everything. +++$+++ 1950s
They send us because they want us to change, or grow up or something and then they try to keep us the same. +++$+++ 1990s
Do you believe me? +++$+++ 1990s
... It's a comfortable place. +++$+++ 1980s
Nicole Labetzki.  Victim seven. Forensics found dog hair in her car, but they had a K-9 unit at the scene and never had it checked. +++$+++ 2000s
Yes, sir. +++$+++ 2000s
These are whipped body creams. It's like a lotion. +++$+++ 2000s
Neighbor, I'd feel better about the damned inconvenience if you'd let me buy you a drink. +++$+++ 1990s
The Champion is smiling and toying with the man -- trying to give the fans their money's worth and make a show of it with the badly out-classes challenger -- Another left to right combination. I feel sorry for -- +++$+++ 1970s
Little nervous. Wanna puke. +++$+++ 2000s
I put them in your hamper.  I thought they were dirty. +++$+++ 1980s
...that's true. Sometimes they change, sometimes they don't. Now, I remember back to when you were disbarred... +++$+++ 1980s
Nothing to speak of. What is this--third degree? +++$+++ 1930s
What do you want? +++$+++ 1930s
Because I want you to tell me. +++$+++ 1980s
Takes diamonds to stay on this list. +++$+++ 1990s
Her name is Annie.  Annie Reed. +++$+++ 1990s
What's that, a ship? +++$+++ 1970s
You're listening to a chorus of angels. The music surrounds you like a... warm and, comfortable pool of water. And while you're sleeping, you're going to be able to recall, all the things that we want you to remember. And when I count to three and clap my hands, you'll no longer be hypnotised. Can you hear me. +++$+++ 1980s
Don't even bother, X man, I'm not your type. +++$+++ 2000s
But how long is a day? +++$+++ 2000s
Now, snap out of it, fella! +++$+++ 1960s
That's real good. You ort not to if ye ain't married to somebody. Bible tells you that much. Hit tells some things that don't seem right too, I reckon. I guess a feller ort to foller it close as he can, though.  You don't touch yourself, do you? +++$+++ 1990s
Didn't it have nothin' to do with me? +++$+++ 1980s
Good evening ... Can we pass? +++$+++ 1960s
Right. +++$+++ 1990s
Why didn't you tell me? +++$+++ 2000s
No. +++$+++ 1980s
My God. I haven't seen you since... +++$+++ 1990s
If he were alive he'd have contacted me. +++$+++ 1990s
I don't care.  I see us as tiny parts of a vast organism, like two bacteria living on a rotting speck of dust floating in an infinite void. +++$+++ 1980s
Okay.  What's up? +++$+++ 2000s
Oh, be real! Would you... Would you please hug me?  I just went through a very traumatic experience and I haven't been having the best day so far. Now come on. +++$+++ 1990s
But you don't have any symptoms! +++$+++ 1980s
Oh. I mean, good. +++$+++ 1980s
Yes. +++$+++ 1990s
It just happened. +++$+++ 2000s
Nobody's gonna kill you. +++$+++ 1980s
They didn't seem too good. +++$+++ 1960s
Mr. Warne? +++$+++ 1930s
It seems to me that walking, for most people, is not very dangerous. +++$+++ 1950s
Huh? Oh, no. +++$+++ 1980s
You're correct.  I'm concerned these students are being funded by foreign interests, whether they know it or not.  The FBI is worthless in this area.  I want your full concentration on this matter ... +++$+++ 1990s
Twelve gauge. You need shells? Moss looks the gun over. +++$+++ 2000s
It's gonna blow this place out. It's gonna ruin it ... +++$+++ 1970s
Sir. I was going Mach point one five. +++$+++ 1980s
Well, I guess it's 'cause he loves you so much. He's jealous and worried. +++$+++ 1990s
I am not at the school anymore. I left last night. +++$+++ 1940s
You're a strange bird. No wonder Gainsford calls you the man who always wanted to see what was on the other side of the hill. +++$+++ 1930s
But what brought you to Sicily? +++$+++ 1980s
Terrific.  I now have a hundred dollar dry cleaning bill. +++$+++ 1990s
I tell you what's cooking.  She made the blind see and it was a gift!  Who was it from?  Let's hear an 'F" for... +++$+++ 1980s
Great to get away, take it easy. Next week, I'll get back to work. +++$+++ 1990s
The guy <u>I</u> see is in the eighth grade at <u>Prep</u> School, and he laughs his <u>ass</u> off every time we talk about you. +++$+++ 1990s
Where? +++$+++ 1980s
I won't let that happen. +++$+++ 2000s
NO, but I will lock you in. +++$+++ 2000s
What? +++$+++ 1990s
Please, have a seat. +++$+++ 2000s
Burbage has my keeping but you have my heart. +++$+++ 1990s
So do I. +++$+++ 1950s
He -- he said if I didn't give the money, he'll kill me. +++$+++ 1960s
It's what we'll find there worries me. +++$+++ 1980s
Forget it. +++$+++ 1990s
Maybe you shoulda killed him. +++$+++ 1940s
Well, why not a little of the King? +++$+++ 2000s
What are we going to do with him? +++$+++ 1950s
So I've been told. +++$+++ 1990s
Oh, gosh. +++$+++ 1980s
No wire. +++$+++ 1990s
I didn't touch him, he just passed out. +++$+++ 1990s
So what am I supposed to do? +++$+++ 2000s
Oh, will you help me?  Can you help me? +++$+++ 1930s
I know I did. +++$+++ 2000s
Constantly. +++$+++ 1980s
I like what you've done with it. When's Captain Nemo moving in? +++$+++ 2000s
Fine. +++$+++ 1970s
Then I can wear men's clothing. +++$+++ 2000s
You can do it. +++$+++ 1990s
What? +++$+++ 1990s
The name's Plissken. +++$+++ 1990s
This should be it... +++$+++ 1980s
They're driving me nuts! +++$+++ 1990s
We just saved a little baby boy. Think of it that way. +++$+++ 1990s
The same place.  One o'clock.  I have to go now.  See you tomorrow.  Remember, I need you. +++$+++ 1990s
Why not?! +++$+++ 1990s
Uhura. Can't you augment? +++$+++ 1980s
You're being unfair. +++$+++ 2000s
Well, these... women friends of yours... all over the world. How does it work? Do you see some of them again? Do you forget others? Do you write them now and then? How do you manage it? +++$+++ 1990s
Ms. Grey -- you work at a school for mutants in Westchester, New York.  Can you tell the members of this committee what exactly you are teaching these mutants? +++$+++ 2000s
Get a phone number for the Smiths. +++$+++ 2000s
Don't wanna miss this. +++$+++ 2000s
Walter, you can't do that! +++$+++ 1940s
Turn that fucking radio off! +++$+++ 2000s
Look again for fuck sake! +++$+++ 1990s
No, it doesn't. You'll see... you get totally sick of all the creeps and losers and weirdos. +++$+++ 2000s
C'mon.  I bought 'em for you, to make up for that night. +++$+++ 2000s
Unlisted age, plus "youthful mind," equals old. +++$+++ 1990s
What's your father do? +++$+++ 1970s
In his mind, anyway, and soon enough in hers.  She had written him many letters of love. +++$+++ 1990s
That's not why I'm attacking him! You don't believe me - all this time you never believed me. +++$+++ 1990s
I know you can't stand me to say I'm fat.  Like I can't stand you being a bank robber.  I guess that's what love is -- huh, Sonny? +++$+++ 1970s
Relax our center... It's just sitting in a bucket. +++$+++ 1990s
No, no.  I on holiday. +++$+++ 1990s
I'm so sorry, Stu. I <u>wanted</u> to tell you what was going on. I really, really liked you. +++$+++ 2000s
My - name - isn't - Bright Eyes It's Taylor! +++$+++ 2000s
Pleased to meet you ... Hi, bow's it going? Pleased to meet you! Hi, Carl Denham ... How's it going? +++$+++ 2000s
No. +++$+++ 1990s
And we can charge anything we want!  Two thousand a day, ten thousand a day - - people will pay it!  And then there's the merchandising - - +++$+++ 1990s
Hi. +++$+++ 1990s
Fuckin' A. +++$+++ 1990s
Cause the Russian production company would be easier to find. +++$+++ 1990s
Could be anything... Men in isolation... some beef that snowballed... got out of hand... +++$+++ 1980s
I don't know exactly. +++$+++ 1980s
What's that? +++$+++ 1980s
"... wait for help."  Wait for help. I'm not opening a door that specifically warns me not to. +++$+++ 1990s
He's been altering the coordinates since we logged on. He's a step ahead. Let's jump to #12. +++$+++ 2000s
I don't know. +++$+++ 1940s
Well, it was good to see you, Daniel, but I have to be going. +++$+++ 1990s
I'm on the run! +++$+++ 2000s
Oh no... this is a battle of nerves between John and me. +++$+++ 1960s
Put it through TACS. Smith, you up for a flyby? +++$+++ 1990s
Is that what you want me to be? +++$+++ 1950s
You're not so bad yourself. +++$+++ 2000s
What are you going to do now, Tom? +++$+++ 1990s
But, Al, it's the bunk! Norville showed me his design for the whatsit the day I met him! Why Buzz couldn't have invented it -- look at the man -- he's an imbecile! +++$+++ 1990s
Peter, I believe your baptism was perverted.  Look at your certificate. Your mother was the only witness to it. Your blood-type doesn't match who you thought your father was.  Peter...I'm sorry. +++$+++ 2000s
Thanks. +++$+++ 1980s
Don't worry about it. +++$+++ 1970s
If I gave you the impression I hated him I didn't mean to.  I... I hate the way he <u>behaves</u>... he's selfish and self-centered and cynical... +++$+++ 1990s
All that money... I mean... did you...? +++$+++ 1990s
No. But that's not the only reason people get together or..stay together. +++$+++ 1990s
No you won't.  You'll be back today. Now!  You get your ass back here, Thelma, now, Goddamnit.  Thelma, do you understand me? +++$+++ 1990s
Sex murder: three. He likes to bite. Six bad ones in Mrs. Leeds.  Eight in Mrs. Jacobi...  ...that's all I have. +++$+++ 1980s
Toxic dumps, huh. +++$+++ 2000s
No one can take my father's place. +++$+++ 1940s
Does he do this all the time? +++$+++ 2000s
'Night, Jim. +++$+++ 1970s
Lemme tell you something.  Vincent and a few other guys like him are fucking ghosts.  Nobody even know what he looked like until now... +++$+++ 2000s
Gimme a week and four guys from litigation and I'll have the Post pleading with us not to sue for libel. +++$+++ 1990s
If I owe, I will go. +++$+++ 2000s
We got to make another copy of this. Little life insurance. +++$+++ 1990s
You said it popped out too easily. Nothing's ever good enough for you, is it? +++$+++ 1990s
Decent? Why Miss Schuyler, I want to be noble. +++$+++ 1930s
I don't think 'fan mail' fits this letter.  Read it, Clark. +++$+++ 1980s
Now there's a woman who totally abuses the privilege of motherhood. +++$+++ 1990s
I never said he was faking! I never said that! +++$+++ 2000s
In Manhattan? +++$+++ 1990s
I know. +++$+++ 1990s
No treasure maps, huh? +++$+++ 1990s
Maybe, if it's a real mourning ring like we have in Jamaica. All you got to do is turn it on your finger, close your eyes, and make a wish. +++$+++ 1940s
Your men! All my life "your men" have been able to count on you? Why is it that you've never been there for me? +++$+++ 1980s
I see. +++$+++ 1990s
Why not? Because of his gibberish about GOd and the Soul? Camouflage -- that's all it is -- to blind the gullible like you! And to hide his real identity -- a fanatic whose only purpose is to kill Benes! And you made it possible! +++$+++ 1960s
I like to sail, believe me, I love to sail! Instead I make boats and other people sail them. +++$+++ 1990s
I didn't ask him that. He's lying. +++$+++ 2000s
I'm a human being, I've got some! +++$+++ 1950s
Yeah, from one side of the harbor to the other. But we got half the Bering Sea and the whole Alaskan gulf to drag her over. +++$+++ 2000s
Nothing - if she dosen't love me - +++$+++ 1940s
Driving their cars into trees... puking on the sidewalk... stupid shit! +++$+++ 2000s
I don't think I'll be running into him. +++$+++ 2000s
Twenty bucks says not here she don't find one. +++$+++ 1990s
Two o'clock. +++$+++ 1960s
I wished to be reinstated at Computer Crimes. I was undiplomatic in my request. +++$+++ 2000s
Oh, wow. +++$+++ 1990s
...I had a great time tonight, really.  It was like the Nuremberg Trials. +++$+++ 1980s
Back where? +++$+++ 1990s
Bluebell came in? +++$+++ 1990s
The key, yeah, the key's in my pants in the bathroom. +++$+++ 1990s
I know about you. +++$+++ 1990s
Thank you. +++$+++ 1960s
I'm sure they'll notice things missing. +++$+++ 1990s
No, c'mon, Freddy, let's have this out & over. You know what everyone thinks? They think you're making a case coz you found yourself a nice piece of ass. And no one's blaming you for it, I hear she's worth the flowers. But don't come in here get- ting holy over us. Sure I put it in the paper. Coz I wanted to <u>stop</u> this bullshit. I don't want you drunk out- ta your head searching my office ag- ain. it's pissing <u>me</u>, & <u>everyone</u> off. +++$+++ 1990s
Have you seen a woman about so high? +++$+++ 1970s
You're imagining it. +++$+++ 1990s
With that cast on -- you don't. +++$+++ 1950s
What's going on? +++$+++ 1980s
Sarah, we could take off and leave this guy behind... +++$+++ 1990s
You'll meet new friends.  I know ... it's rough.  But I have to move, son. +++$+++ 1950s
I've been thinking about you a lot all these years, locked up in my cell.  I'd tear through every issue of the Midwest Science Journal looking for your latest findings, watching as you slowly worked your polymerization experiments up through single celled organisms to that holiest of holies, the fruit fly.  Exciting stuff.  I got to tell you, it really kept me going. +++$+++ 1990s
Hear what? +++$+++ 1990s
He's turning blue! +++$+++ 1990s
You bet it is ... and Luke's out in it. +++$+++ 1980s
You didn't tell your sister about Ripley, did you?  'Cause I don't wanna go through that again. +++$+++ 1990s
Wouldn't it be fabulous if we somehow stayed in love for the rest of our lives? +++$+++ 1990s
Take a look across the street. +++$+++ 1990s
Right. +++$+++ 1990s
Right away.  Will you have something, Mr. Thompson? +++$+++ 1940s
Can't we just ice them along with the rest of the citizenry? +++$+++ 1940s
Are you done with these? +++$+++ 1950s
Oh I wouldn't miss it for the world. I bet you did such a great job. +++$+++ 2000s
A little... You think it's the same for Jacques? +++$+++ 1980s
That would hardly be proper. +++$+++ 2000s
Where is he now, sir? +++$+++ 1970s
Cut the crap, X, I saw you down there. You're a hero. Don't be afraid to join the good guys. +++$+++ 2000s
Nice day, Major. +++$+++ 1930s
Ignorant.  The thing's ignorant. +++$+++ 1990s
Can I see some of the other tapes to get an idea of what -- +++$+++ 1980s
Yeah, come on in. +++$+++ 1990s
That what you want? +++$+++ 2000s
What a fine boy you have, Jabez. How old is he now? +++$+++ 2000s
What? +++$+++ 1990s
In your operation. +++$+++ 1990s
Easy, Johnny.  Now ain't the time.  I tell you, boys, even I'm Worried what'll happen once Ringo Runs this outfit!  God have mercy! +++$+++ 1990s
Go out there! Find somebody, ask some questions!  I'm sorry if I seem over-anxious to you. I keep thinking... something's wrong. I have to know what! +++$+++ 1960s
He talked to me today. Told me to keep my mouth shut or I'd get everybody in trouble. +++$+++ 1980s
Not quite. You haven't announced our engagement yet. +++$+++ 1990s
He just needs some clothes? +++$+++ 1990s
Yeah, so I noticed. Have you made up your mind? +++$+++ 1940s
No. No! No! +++$+++ 1960s
Newmeat looks like a poker player, Drag. +++$+++ 1960s
What? +++$+++ 1990s
If we don't get out of here soon we can ask him in person. +++$+++ 1990s
What's the job? +++$+++ 1950s
Way past it. +++$+++ 1980s
So many authors are denied the gratification of a concrete response to their work. I am blessed, am I not? +++$+++ 2000s
Yes, dear. You forgot all about it. +++$+++ 1950s
I never thought I'd ask this of anyone, Andy, but do me a favor and kill the evil son-of-a-bitch, will you? +++$+++ 1990s
Alright, enough, Ross. You'll bring on my "Nervous Tick" ... +++$+++ 1990s
You can't. +++$+++ 1950s
Red cross over to blue double blue ...is that what it is? A squid? +++$+++ 1990s
Patch him through.... +++$+++ 1990s
Claire... +++$+++ 2000s
According to you I'm a sexual failure. An animal, you said.  You know now, don't you? +++$+++ 1980s
Not ghosts... at least not what you're thinking... Vannacutt used to dump the bodies of his failed experiments somewhere in the house... +++$+++ 1990s
Hey! You don't need to be a scientist figure it out... +++$+++ 1990s
I'm gonna head back to the office... finish up some things. +++$+++ 1990s
Oh, Stew and I went for a long ride.  Dexter, is there any finishing school we can send him to? +++$+++ 1930s
I lost my gun after I left you today and I'm the laughing stock of a lot of people.  I wanted to tell you that. I wanted you to know...and it's on my mind and it makes me look like a fool and I feel like a fool and you asked that we should say things, that we should say what we're thinknig and not lie about things and I'll tell you that, this: that I lost my gun and I'm not a good cop...and I'm looked down at...and I know that....and I'm scared that once you find that out you might not like me. +++$+++ 1990s
I've been dealing in Earth's politics a good deal longer than you have.  Goodnight, sir. +++$+++ 2000s
Engineering... +++$+++ 1970s
You're everything a guy could want. +++$+++ 2000s
Yeah, I fixed it. Well, I ain't... um, I can't remember. I think I took it out to fit the bags and forgot to put it back. +++$+++ 2000s
I can't believe we're stealing a plane. +++$+++ 2000s
Miami? +++$+++ 1990s
Bastaldi got the address from you, yes? +++$+++ 2000s
Do we have to invite him to the wedding? +++$+++ 1990s
Maybe somebody felt that four shares were too many -- +++$+++ 1960s
I think it's the most exciting --  We're going to see things no one ever saw before. The actual physical process of Life itself -- not something under a microscope... Just think of it -- +++$+++ 1960s
Dad! +++$+++ 1980s
Yes! +++$+++ 2000s
Where's the collar, in the cells? +++$+++ 2000s
Do I know you? +++$+++ 2000s
He could see me. +++$+++ 2000s
Billy had alibis too. +++$+++ 1990s
Hi, boys, we almost gave up on you. +++$+++ 1990s
Does she have a cell phone?  A way we can contact her? +++$+++ 2000s
Why not? +++$+++ 1990s
And how many people did you cut up with the couple of with it? Or hundred knives you've probably owned in your lifetime? +++$+++ 1950s
Very well. I suppose I could make out my weekly report to Starfleet Command without your input.  "Admiral Lusby, regarding the unusual behavior of Jean-Luc Picard: I find him increasingly irritable, remote and uncooperative. I recommend forced shore leave at a Starbase facility in order to-" +++$+++ 1990s
He died -- about five or six years ago. +++$+++ 1990s
The deadly nightshade you slipped me wore off, Sally... I thought I'd find you here.... +++$+++ 1990s
Blocked at every turn.  Beautifully synchronized, don't you agree? +++$+++ 1990s
Hey Chief. Bring my cup back. +++$+++ 1970s
Have you broken it yet?  We've got six more heads and that means six more hours. +++$+++ 2000s
Then what goes on in there?  What I mean is, what are you thinking about? +++$+++ 1990s
Question is, what are you doing here? +++$+++ 2000s
Miss Caswell?  What? +++$+++ 1950s
Don't thank me, Dr. Johnson.  You weren't my choice.  The Pentagon made me take you. +++$+++ 1990s
You want to skip fourth period and go to the Ridge? +++$+++ 2000s
Yes. The famous James Bond. I've heard all about you, sir. You were under direct orders to act as an observer - and yet you had to go off, on your own, like some half-assed CIA cowboy -  Endangering the gold, attracting that lunatic woman, and then putting in a distress call for us to save your bloody hide. +++$+++ 1990s
It's Cochrane. +++$+++ 1990s
A rare pleasure to meet you, ma'am! Where I come from --out in Montana--we have some pretty women, but I guess if you walked down Main Street they'd turn out the fire brigade. +++$+++ 1930s
Can you get us a line? +++$+++ 1970s
Listen, Baxter, we made you and we can break you. +++$+++ 1960s
Do I look like I need your money.  It doesn’t work like that and I can’t tell you why. +++$+++ 2000s
Such power exists? +++$+++ 2000s
What makes you say that? +++$+++ 1990s
I'm afraid I've gotten too old for this sort of thing. +++$+++ 1970s
This man belongs in hospital. +++$+++ 1980s
"The dark inside..."? I don't understand. +++$+++ 1990s
Christ, I don't believe this! +++$+++ 1990s
I'm gonna rip you up bitch. Just like your slut whore mother. +++$+++ 1990s
You wouldn't even see it move. +++$+++ 1990s
What do you want? +++$+++ 1990s
Yeah, all right... +++$+++ 1990s
Well, you did and she's fine. Thanks. +++$+++ 1970s
He took care of Charlie for us. +++$+++ 1960s
As much as possible. +++$+++ 1970s
No, it's pronounced Aye gor. +++$+++ 1970s
Okay. Just remember that. Now beat it. +++$+++ 1930s
Wrong. Jason can't get a fair trial because of _these_. +++$+++ 2000s
I think I'd remember that. +++$+++ 1990s
Ninotchka, do you like me just a little bit? +++$+++ 1930s
WE NEVER SUSPECTED YOU! +++$+++ 1980s
Your wife, sir? Has she gone away? +++$+++ 1970s
Maybe we should start thinking about going home, huh? +++$+++ 1980s
What do you want with our scan-proof lockers? +++$+++ 1970s
I'm sorry but I have to leave. I'll find other work. You'll have to get someone else, that's all. +++$+++ 2000s
Hello.... oh, just a minute.  Police department? +++$+++ 1930s
Hard to compare the people you're taking down with the Lord. +++$+++ 2000s
Just now... +++$+++ 1970s
You ain't like that no more. +++$+++ 1990s
Johnny, wait... +++$+++ 1990s
Yes it was all you -- +++$+++ 2000s
Mr. Spicoli, you're on dangerous ground here. You're causing a major disturbance in my class and on my time. +++$+++ 1980s
You took a cab to see three kung fu movies? +++$+++ 1990s
Salute. +++$+++ 1990s
I'm pissing you off? I'm doing what I said I'd do. What the hell are you doing? What about your word? +++$+++ 1990s
Who came up with the Monster's makeup and look? +++$+++ 1990s
Well, I can't imagine five years of unemployment -- +++$+++ 1990s
I know. +++$+++ 2000s
Good morning, my lord! +++$+++ 1990s
Certainly, Mr. Jones! Certainly! Charlie! +++$+++ 1930s
-- unless Frank is specifically ommitted as a beneficiary that's what will happen. +++$+++ 1990s
No, I'm sorry, for pushing you out. +++$+++ 2000s
No, of course not. It's only that he called last night and asked if I could come by. +++$+++ 1970s
You should have stayed in bed this morning. +++$+++ 1960s
Thank you, sir. I've looked forward to this for a long time. +++$+++ 1980s
I think anti-semitism today is largely a Jewish phenomenon. Wouldn't you agree? +++$+++ 2000s
Don't go to any trouble.  We believe you... We believe you. +++$+++ 1980s
You going to Knott's Berry Farm with him? +++$+++ 1970s
I can explain it.  Attempted murder wasn't enough for him.  He wants to add kidnapping to the charges. +++$+++ 1990s
Don't have one, Carl. I have a number, man. Just like the numbers on those treasury checks. You stole from your own country, Carl. Shame on you. +++$+++ 1990s
I don't have it. That's why Vincent went to Chicago. They arrested him before he could bring it back. +++$+++ 2000s
I'm sorry!  I said something wrong, didn't I!  Please forgive me! +++$+++ 1990s
Yes ... yes, but I'm not sure what I saw anymore. +++$+++ 1950s
Don't worry! +++$+++ 1980s
Our relationship's moving fast, I know, but I have real, real respect for you. +++$+++ 1980s
Not a clue. +++$+++ 1990s
I love you, Adam. +++$+++ 1960s
Look, I'm rock climbing Sunday. How about coming along? +++$+++ 1990s
Still am.  There's more gold than I thought, and since there's only two of us now...  Where should I go? +++$+++ 1990s
Cute.  He was inside for about 20 minutes.  The other guy, Roach, waited in the truck.  They were scoping it out, right?! +++$+++ 1990s
I'll take some lessons this time. I promise. +++$+++ 1980s
Enjoyed it? +++$+++ 1970s
Would he know? +++$+++ 1960s
We both lied to him. +++$+++ 2000s
What deviant groups or organizations did he secretly belong to?  What is it, Bob?! +++$+++ 1990s
Okay. +++$+++ 1990s
Yes, My Lord.  We'll find them. +++$+++ 1980s
Oh, no reason, you keep me prisoner, you make me burn my book, you drive a sledgehammer into my ankles... +++$+++ 1990s
Okay, Willard, sit down. +++$+++ 1970s
You will, eh? Well, we'll see about that.  All right, boys. Take it. +++$+++ 1940s
Says me. I've been here for half an hour. I'd call that first dibs. +++$+++ 1990s
I know -- but she wants you to represent her if Cardenas files. +++$+++ 1990s
What're you talkin' about? +++$+++ 1990s
So? +++$+++ 1990s
No way. +++$+++ 1990s
You don't think I'm going to let this blackmailer intimidate me, do you? +++$+++ 1940s
Maybe we should soap your hand or something. +++$+++ 1990s
Well, you should. +++$+++ 1980s
Thanks very much.  Care for some suchi?. +++$+++ 1980s
So it's six hundred feet below Park Avenue, It's still a Park Avenue address. +++$+++ 1970s
If old pictures interest you, come back some time, there's quite a collection down in the pagoda.  I'll see you get a proper tour. +++$+++ 1990s
What's this about not eating? +++$+++ 1930s
I hope we all get to do many things. Can we go now? +++$+++ 2000s
If there is, develop it! +++$+++ 1970s
Just gimme a chance. +++$+++ 1970s
Tell us the truth.  You don't just find these things, at least not in this neighborhood. +++$+++ 1990s
I want the girl.  Unharmed.  Now. +++$+++ 1990s
I'm walking towards the elevator's, Janet. +++$+++ 1990s
She's only known the guy a few months. +++$+++ 2000s
This one's got you working overtime, hasn't it? +++$+++ 1990s
...sorry, Molly. I'm sorry this happened to you. +++$+++ 1980s
Three days. +++$+++ 1990s
I appreciate the welcome; I wish the circumstances were less critical.  Epsilon Nine is monitoring the intruder; keep a channel open to them.  Where is Captain Decker? +++$+++ 1970s
No! Not again! +++$+++ 1980s
Shall I leave? +++$+++ 1990s
I know, I know. +++$+++ 2000s
Listen to me, Sal. If you don't do it they'll put you in the pit. If they put you in the pit, Sal, you're gonna die... Sal, do you understand? +++$+++ 1970s
Let the record show I'm just standing here. +++$+++ 1990s
Good.  Your old man's all right, he just saved your life. +++$+++ 1990s
What's wrong, Nathan? +++$+++ 1970s
You think this'll work? +++$+++ 1990s
God ... this can't be true. +++$+++ 1990s
You doubt me? +++$+++ 1980s
A pianist. +++$+++ 2000s
When can I have one? +++$+++ 1970s
You are ready, then? +++$+++ 1980s
What's wrong? +++$+++ 2000s
You have changed since second grade. +++$+++ 2000s
Stay away from me! Dad! Dad! +++$+++ 2000s
That's what the newspapers say. Weren't for Jesse James, this gang wouldn't be able to find a goat's ass with a stick. +++$+++ 2000s
Pleased to meet you, sir. +++$+++ 1930s
Okay, we'll split up.  You go to every romantic place you guys have, I'll go... someplace brilliant, and the first one who... +++$+++ 1990s
You guys are so sweet! +++$+++ 2000s
No. +++$+++ 2000s
We'll see that she gets there in good time +++$+++ 1940s
I know someone else who's sensitive. +++$+++ 1980s
Before I met your maw, God rest her soul, it used to be I was kinda... wicked... drinkin' spirits an' gettin' into scrapes an' all. Only she made me see the error of my ways an'... I ain't like I was no more. +++$+++ 1990s
Mac.  What's shaking? +++$+++ 1990s
I have no illusions about the future. What is, is. We make choices. And we become the sum total of our choices. I can live with that. +++$+++ 1990s
Start the car. +++$+++ 1990s
Can I tell you kids something? +++$+++ 1980s
I'm not interested in your book. I'm talking about the Building and Loan. +++$+++ 1940s
You'd know better'n me. +++$+++ 2000s
What the hell do you think it was about?  There's nothing an unproved heir to the throne likes less than glaring competence in others. +++$+++ 2000s
Shit!  Oh, shit. +++$+++ 1990s
I don't know what you mean, sir. +++$+++ 1970s
Hundred and eight ain't a hundred and thirteen. +++$+++ 1970s
I wish there was some way I could... just... pay the fine and go home. +++$+++ 1990s
This is a great house, really. Everything. Saunas, Jacuzzis, three tennis courts. You know who the original owners were? Nelson Eddy, then Legs Diamond. Then you know who lived here? +++$+++ 1970s
Who are you? +++$+++ 2000s
What do you wish me to do? +++$+++ 1970s
I don't know why I feel so good. I haven't felt this good in a long time. +++$+++ 1980s
Dad's disappeared! +++$+++ 2000s
General Schmuck, are you positive of your figures? +++$+++ 1960s
He using her. +++$+++ 1990s
Did you get her name? +++$+++ 1980s
Oh no!  Wear a coat of cotton--wear a coat of wool. +++$+++ 1970s
Plans for absorbing the Tibetan army into the People's Army will soon be finalized. +++$+++ 1990s
Could this be a trap? +++$+++ 1980s
The day I show respect to Biff Tannen will be the day I win a million dollars... What's the matter, Biff, they're not showing you any respect down at the golf course? Don't they realize what a tough job it is keeping the criminal element away from the country club? +++$+++ 1980s
They're going to walk right past me. +++$+++ 2000s
I got caught robbing a synagogue. Lots of good stuff in them holy places; churches, temples, mosques, and who's guarding them? +++$+++ 1990s
Oh Yeah? What's your master plan here? +++$+++ 1990s
Dealing +++$+++ 1970s
Goddamnit!  What am I doing?  What's happened to all my cigars?  Colonel Richards here has had a dozen agents on these cases for over a year.  No arrests, no leads, no clues... +++$+++ 1990s
Well, I kinda just blurted it out over a root beer float. +++$+++ 1990s
I wish I had my board with me now. Even if I could only polish it once in awhile. +++$+++ 1970s
Who's this fat man, then? +++$+++ 1990s
Don't have Weather Channel in the Mountain, Nick. +++$+++ 2000s
Baaaa! Fuck it, they sold us out - so what! What'd you'all expect? Civilian life is phoney BULLSHIT man. They're ROBOTS man - watchin' dopey television and drivin' dopey cars, and they fuck up, nobody dies. That's all right, you keep fuckin' up, politicians keep lyin'. Cause it don't really matter. Don't mean shit. So what! Whatcha want - a parade! Fuck that too! No war time no grunt never got no respect. Till he was dead - and even THEN! You're fighting for YOURSELF man! You're fighting for your SOUL, dat's all. Remember dat. And it's some goddamn battle too - if you'se a man, wrestle with that angel...  ...Love and Hate - the whole shitbang show, that's the story then and now and it ain't hardly gonna change... +++$+++ 1980s
... idiot! Open the damn door! Go, go, go, come on! +++$+++ 1990s
Can you cover me for an hour? +++$+++ 1990s
I know what you're like .. +++$+++ 1990s
This is sweet!! +++$+++ 1990s
It takes about twenty to twenty-two hours for the current to reach here from Lisca Bianca. +++$+++ 1960s
-- please, please forgive me... +++$+++ 1970s
No, no.  I'm fine.  What did the Speaker say? +++$+++ 1990s
Okay, sweetheart. Have a lovely Birthday Party tomorrow. +++$+++ 1960s
Don't let them take me, Steve -- +++$+++ 1980s
You know what I mean.  I saw a lot of strange things going on in this office this summer.  And a lotta strange people. +++$+++ 1990s
She <u>is</u>--she's helped solve a bunch of murders: Arizona, New Mexico-- +++$+++ 2000s
No! I can't explain now. Oh, look -- the pearls. You wear them now... +++$+++ 1930s
Yeah. +++$+++ 1970s
Don't. +++$+++ 1970s
It was a hard assignment, that's why you got it. +++$+++ 1990s
Alive. +++$+++ 1960s
I don't know. +++$+++ 1990s
And they took that away. +++$+++ 2000s
O-o-oh, I get you—  All right. All right. I don't blame you. I kinda forgot myself for a moment, there. That's what I call getting me told, isn't it, Anne? +++$+++ 1930s
Oh, Biff. You can "pin" me any time you want to. +++$+++ 1990s
If I had a nickel for every one of Alan's flyboy buddies who tried to pick me up, I'd be a rich woman. +++$+++ 1980s
I thought Steve had talked to you? +++$+++ 1980s
Oh come off it, Mare. What about what's-his-name... Steverino? You could've at least passed the baton on that one. +++$+++ 1990s
What? +++$+++ 2000s
Ah. +++$+++ 2000s
The nightcrawler.  The bloodsucker. +++$+++ 1980s
Sure, Pete Clemenza died of a heart attack, but the Rosato Brothers gave it to him. +++$+++ 1970s
What?  What movie? +++$+++ 2000s
I don't know. He must have had some purpose in taking the plane away from Fenner.  When he lands, we'll find out. +++$+++ 1930s
Your Majesty -- +++$+++ 1990s
I got some hair stuff. +++$+++ 2000s
What I'm trying to say, Mitch, is these things happen sometimes, you know? Ain't much we can do about it. +++$+++ 1960s
Dead. +++$+++ 1980s
I never saw anything like it. How did she pick him up so fast? +++$+++ 1990s
Annette, just use your hand. +++$+++ 1990s
Only the mention made in that phone call. There's no Swedish hitman of any renown, much less one with a million dollar day rate. +++$+++ 2000s
It's dead. +++$+++ 1930s
This fence...it's so... +++$+++ 2000s
What about Ricky? He'd jump at the opportunity. +++$+++ 2000s
Good. Gibby gave me champagne. +++$+++ 1990s
Is Krupchek an aggressive guy?  Hot- tempered?  Anything like that? +++$+++ 2000s
What, like it's that hard? +++$+++ 2000s
Didn't Mr. Marsh also tell you that Miss Lawson felt bored here and was thinking about going back to Chicago for awhile? +++$+++ 1990s
So, if I win it's because deep down you know you're about to make the biggest mistake of your life, and deep down your want me to stop you. +++$+++ 2000s
We don't want to tire you out, dear. +++$+++ 1990s
I can die trying. +++$+++ 2000s
There ya go.  I beg your pardon? +++$+++ 1980s
Oh, a D-Girl. You know... I have a really great idea for a screenplay. +++$+++ 1980s
Not hungry. I want to get through this work in a hurry, and then I want to go home. What price did you get on those trucks? +++$+++ 1930s
Silent night, violent night... +++$+++ 1990s
Maybe it ain't coming. +++$+++ 1980s
I guess somebody beat me to it. +++$+++ 1990s
Work hard, be good at your job. Sir. Do whatever they tell you. +++$+++ 1990s
How does she like what in bed? +++$+++ 1990s
There, that's nice. I have to have my pictures when I travel. And Freddy of course.  Isn't that right, sweetie. +++$+++ 1990s
Goodbye. +++$+++ 1990s
This is a one time thing, Gusto.  One and I'm out.  Give me a good price for old time's sake.  What do you think? +++$+++ 2000s
Let us go, miss. +++$+++ 1970s
Commander, I must speak to you. It is a matter of supreme importance... We are Thermians from the Klatu Nebula, and we require your help. I beseech you to come with us, back to our ship. A great many lives hang in the balance... +++$+++ 1990s
Well I guess folks don't mind they's integrated. +++$+++ 2000s
You mean they'll replace you with someone who won't perform abortions. +++$+++ 1990s
What's his real name? +++$+++ 2000s
What are you talking about? Bateman is what? +++$+++ 2000s
No, they're all right.  I meant, you just got here. +++$+++ 1990s
Does your Mum and Dad know about Tony? +++$+++ 1980s
I hate the weird ones. +++$+++ 1980s
Unbearable, I'd imagine. +++$+++ 1990s
And video games after! +++$+++ 2000s
That doesn't tell us much. Did you run a check on the gas like I told you? +++$+++ 1990s
Well, try, huh. +++$+++ 1990s
Brian Cruikshank -- it would serve me right if I got stuck with that one. +++$+++ 1960s
Uh, this is our paleobotanist, Dr Ellie..... +++$+++ 1990s
It's possible. I don't know about that. +++$+++ 1990s
Now Betty, don't overreact. +++$+++ 1980s
Turn the light on. +++$+++ 2000s
You shouldn'ta turned the gun on that kid, man.  You shouldn'ta -- +++$+++ 1980s
We're getting married. +++$+++ 1980s
It's no use.  We'll never get away with it, Joe. +++$+++ 1950s
You showed up. Oh, my god! Holy shit! Look at this car, man! +++$+++ 1990s
Apone...where are your people? Anybody in D-Block? +++$+++ 1980s
No.  No, sir.  I loved that condo. I loved every stick of furniture. The lamps, the chairs, the rugs, were me.  The dishes were me.  The plants were... +++$+++ 1990s
Oh, no? +++$+++ 1990s
Stupid watch.  Stopped again.  Do you have the -- +++$+++ 2000s
But you were such good <i>friends...</i> +++$+++ 2000s
...and buried him. +++$+++ 1940s
That part, Nick... was planned out the day I read your letters. +++$+++ 2000s
Well don't drag your ass.  There won't be much of a window for us to link up.  We'll be in your orbit trajectory in less than two hours. +++$+++ 1990s
Yes.  Isn't it there? +++$+++ 1990s
That's good. That's uh... good. +++$+++ 2000s
I'm pretty close. But when I wrote the last contact switches, it wiped out a piece of the content filer. You know what it's like, writing software. +++$+++ 2000s
What do you want ? +++$+++ 1960s
Well, then you know what I'm talking about. Anyway, here's the story. I scored with these two chicks. True story. +++$+++ 1990s
Panther... +++$+++ 1980s
Don't get hurt. +++$+++ 2000s
Courage is an emotion too, Data.  Now, can you project the course of the ribbon? +++$+++ 1990s
Right.  They don't trust!  They don't trust America! +++$+++ 1990s
What can I tell you? +++$+++ 1990s
Do you? +++$+++ 1990s
I'm just trying to be a gentleman, show some respect... +++$+++ 1990s
Tim, what are you talking about? +++$+++ 1990s
Why are you here?  Really. +++$+++ 1990s
The ring? We'll have no more nonsense about the ring. +++$+++ 1940s
That's fine. +++$+++ 1970s
I'm not going to give you my keys. +++$+++ 1980s
Not that I know of.  Explanation? +++$+++ 1990s
You need a good review and you'll be fine.  The whole color of the world will change, mark my words. +++$+++ 2000s
Angel, Second Class. +++$+++ 1940s
No, Clarence. Just forget it, babe. I just wanna disappear from there. +++$+++ 1990s
You ... You ... I'd expect it of an Anglo, yes ... but you ... +++$+++ 1950s
It's not that cold. Here, let me wrap it. +++$+++ 2000s
Where do you want to do this? +++$+++ 1970s
No, I think it means, "Recall period Mistake," and the OPE is probably the CRM-114 code. Terry? +++$+++ 1960s
I am the oldest. +++$+++ 2000s
I wasn't singing to myself. +++$+++ 1940s
Smart for your age, eh? Top of your class? Tell me, do you know what the word &quot;propaganda&quot; means? +++$+++ 1990s
Hey.  At least it's not an editing machine. +++$+++ 1990s
Finally realized Rick's a jerk, huh? +++$+++ 1980s
This is too fast.  This is <U>way</U> too fast! +++$+++ 2000s
Won't worry about it. You go ahead. +++$+++ 1990s
This is the personnel file on the programmer, Lindenmeyer. There might be something in it you can use. +++$+++ 1990s
I want to do something <u>positive</u>... +++$+++ 2000s
I need an extra fifty.  Two patrolmen at twenty apiece and a dime for the watch commander at Hollywood Station. +++$+++ 1990s
For me they are exactly as they were when we met three days ago -- just three days ago... don't you realize? And you and Anna... No, I guess they aren't like that any more. My God, is it possible to forget in such a short time, for things to change so quickly? +++$+++ 1960s
Yes? +++$+++ 1990s
Nothing. I broke a lamp. +++$+++ 1990s
What's funny? +++$+++ 1990s
We can't do that, dude -- +++$+++ 2000s
I see the Prince of Wales is here. +++$+++ 1990s
Because -- I am. +++$+++ 1960s
Thank you. We'll all keep that in mind. 'Bye now. +++$+++ 1980s
Why? Why's anything happen? It's all money, man. Money. The girl just got in the way. +++$+++ 2000s
No, let her rest. +++$+++ 1990s
I can't get over what those guys did to her. I just can't. +++$+++ 1990s
Come on. Come swimmin' with us. +++$+++ 1990s
All right, Johnnie, you want to play it this way, I can play it this way. You want to know who made a mistake, why don't you open the case. +++$+++ 1990s
...Let me just show you. +++$+++ 1990s
So many children. Are they all orphans? +++$+++ 1990s
Look, people undress in public because, A, they're exhibitionists, B, they're nutcases, or C, they need the money. I can tell you're not A, and I hope to hell you're not B. So my suggestion is, think about why you're a C and let your body party, shake your groove thing, boogie oogie oogie till you just can't boogie no more. +++$+++ 1990s
Some, you were, you were going to make a reservation for us?  Where's my schedule? Where are we <u>booked</u> tonight? +++$+++ 2000s
A vacuum, Edmund.  That's what we have in Los Angeles.  Sending Mickey Cohen up created it.  My containment work maintained it. Certain photographs guarantee it. Organized crime has been held back, but there's still a demand for the services it provides. +++$+++ 1990s
If they're not busted now, they're gonna be.  It's wide open. +++$+++ 1990s
No -- clothes.  Stevie, they changed into them. +++$+++ 1970s
Hey, where y'at, Frank?  You're wasting your time here.  Big Jim gave strict orders.  No FBI allowed. +++$+++ 1990s
State to federal jurisdiction... We can do it - eventually - but we'll never get all the clearances in time. Can you convince him a deal's already in place? +++$+++ 1990s
No. +++$+++ 1990s
I've seen it. +++$+++ 1970s
I'm soldier of the Republic, you'll need the mahogany truncheon for this boyo. A nation once again. +++$+++ 1960s
You didn't know? But then why did you... well, don't worry. It's relatively mild. +++$+++ 1990s
Come on Buddy, you wouldn't want to got me disbarred now would you? +++$+++ 1980s
She has reason to be suspicious..Doesn't she? +++$+++ 2000s
Them po' young folks. Looks like Norville's in fo' the same kind o' heartache ol' Warin' had. But then, she never axed me 'bout dat... +++$+++ 1990s
Oh, Mark! Is this the baby's room? It's beautiful! +++$+++ 2000s
What are you spying on? +++$+++ 1990s
This is it... I wasn't sure if it even really existed. +++$+++ 1990s
Can we go now, huh? LUCY Maybe later.  Grandpa's expecting us. +++$+++ 1980s
I'm going through a period of my life where I just can't be around people.  I didn't want to wind up abusing anyone. +++$+++ 1980s
Exactly. A dance. +++$+++ 1980s
Well, then, I'll take it up with her. +++$+++ 1990s
Sit down a moment, Billy.  I'm afraid I have some bad news for you. +++$+++ 1970s
Shut up.  Are you nuts? +++$+++ 1950s
Well, I don't want to look like I know what's coming... +++$+++ 2000s
You ever see her talk to the walls? +++$+++ 1970s
'Bout the same time I busted Doucet I tried to nail this big-time dealer. I didn't have an ID, but I was close. Too close.  Gained the confidence of a badass named Dubbs.  He was going to turn me onto the big man.  He made me for a cop.  Mysteriously my fellow officers discovered ten pounds of heroin in my cruiser. +++$+++ 1990s
Mistake?  Hey, guy, get back here! +++$+++ 2000s
The young are eating the old, something that usually doesn't happen here. +++$+++ 1980s
What do you think, Josephine?  What does it say in your crystal ball? +++$+++ 1950s
There are lots of reason... I had a thought that if you had sex with Simon it might... +++$+++ 1990s
Department of Commerce. She's a secretary.  They have a man they call the Secretary, but he isn't at all. My mother's a real secretary.  Mr. Carpenter -- now can we go see the space ship? +++$+++ 2000s
This is what family is for, Ed! This is when ya come together! +++$+++ 2000s
-- there's already been way too many complications for a very simple plan. You ever find out what happened to Melissa Marr? +++$+++ 1990s
Listen everybody, I know this may sound corny, I've had a few glasses of wine and that kind of makes me a little emotional, but I'm going to say it anyway. It just came over me in a rush. I want you all to know that I care about each and every one of you at this table. +++$+++ 1990s
Objection! +++$+++ 1990s
Can't see a thing.  Are you sure? +++$+++ 1990s
The Butler did it.  Guy was a cross between Alistair Cook and a Cuisinart. Dude took Mr. Ed and humptied dumptied it over Gates's head.  He said it was made by, get this, Leonardo.. +++$+++ 1990s
You look like Robinson after that last LaMotta fight.  'Course LaMotta looked a lot worse.  So you're twenty-two, right? +++$+++ 1990s
What about? +++$+++ 1970s
Eh? +++$+++ 1990s
I'm not interested in the details. And I'm not interested in the big picture either.  What I am inter- ersted in is how my Board got conven- ed behind my back, is entertaining a further proposal from a man whom it offends me to do business with, moreover has the audacity to present this to me like a prize fish, and I am expected to clap for it like a performing seal.  No, thank you. +++$+++ 1990s
I was with Valerie, I swear. This is Adrian's work. I've got to find him. +++$+++ 2000s
...excuse me?! +++$+++ 1990s
Which is guy-speak for... +++$+++ 1990s
I really think you're +++$+++ 1990s
259-7881. +++$+++ 2000s
Have you no fear of God? +++$+++ 1990s
He tried to disconnect ROK.  It gassed him.  That computer is running this ship and we're heading right for the sun. +++$+++ 1980s
Can't. +++$+++ 1990s
Yeah, I know. +++$+++ 1980s
And you gonna live it with him? +++$+++ 2000s
I heard you opera-lovers were having a little rally - so I thought I better be around in case anybody decides to sing. +++$+++ 1950s
What is Mac out? +++$+++ 2000s
You're doomed. I'm leaving here in two hours and then they're going to come up here and beat the mortal shit out of you with big saps. Right there in that tub. +++$+++ 1990s
Thank you, Uncle. +++$+++ 1970s
But in order to do so, the church must first prove her heresy, or else you'll be burning a martyr... +++$+++ 2000s
They were simple songs. +++$+++ 1980s
Without the Mask it doesn't matter. +++$+++ 1990s
No problem. It's not as though I'm rushing off to the opera or anything. +++$+++ 1990s
As soon as you stop <u>acting</u> like one. Come on, you're <u>smarter</u> than this. You think those people out there <u>care</u> about you?  You're just a <u>fad</u> to them. +++$+++ 1990s
Naomi. +++$+++ 2000s
Get knotted. +++$+++ 2000s
I wish that was all Miss Weathers, but there's more. The killer left a note. +++$+++ 2000s
No prob: I'll just hop down the hardware store -- +++$+++ 1990s
What? +++$+++ 2000s
Go to the water, it's that way! +++$+++ 2000s
Coming about.... +++$+++ 1970s
Don't worry. +++$+++ 1980s
Doctor Nichols, I might have something to offer <u>you</u>. +++$+++ 1980s
You were attracted to me? +++$+++ 1990s
Maybe that bartender made it up. I mean I think coyotes are rather beautiful. Maybe "coyote ugly" is really a compliment. Like someone who's conventionally "ugly" but is really beautiful. +++$+++ 1980s
The quicker the better. Well -- I finally got out what I came in to tell you.  So long, Walter, and better luck next time. +++$+++ 1940s
Good boy. Good job. And you call yourself "not a doctor"!  Keep an eye on her--she's in trouble. +++$+++ 1990s
I surrender -- +++$+++ 2000s
It's a 27B/6, what did you think it was? +++$+++ 1980s
I have new respect for some of my kids, meeting the parents they've been dealt-- +++$+++ 1990s
Excuse me. I was just going up to my room. +++$+++ 2000s
We'll be stuck here for a little while -- about thirty minutes. +++$+++ 2000s
No, please. +++$+++ 1990s
And speaking of which, here's the light of my life, the pert and saucy Miss Julie McElroy. +++$+++ 2000s
Can it, Pluchinsky. And shove some cotton up your nose. +++$+++ 2000s
Well, he's killing now. +++$+++ 1970s
What is this? Why didn't you tell me? What?... I don't remember any of this. +++$+++ 1990s
Fifty-two disruptor banks, twenty-seven photon torpedo bays, primary and secondary phased shields. +++$+++ 2000s
What is your intended purpose of your visit to the United States? +++$+++ 2000s
What are you doing? +++$+++ 1980s
I'm sorry. +++$+++ 1990s
I dern near had me a touchdown till them boys got a-hold of me there so I figured I better give it off to you. I seen you over there follerin' me. +++$+++ 1990s
I don't. +++$+++ 1990s
This says "Mercer could not identify any of the photographs as being identical with the person she had observed slouched over the wheel of a green Ford pickup truck."  That's not true.  I recognized him and I told them so... They also said it was a dark green air conditioning truck, which it was not.  And here...  ...on the Dallas Sheriff's report. This is really strange.  See that notarized signature on the bottom of each page?  That's not my signature. And there never was any notary present during any of my questioning.  I guess that's all... +++$+++ 1990s
You think I don't know that? +++$+++ 2000s
Riddick...was thinkin' we should make some kind of deal. Just in case, you know, this actually -- +++$+++ 2000s
You want to ask her out tonight, right? And then you want to give her your school pin ... +++$+++ 1990s
A limousine has just pulled up. +++$+++ 1990s
I know you're cops, but I thought you were just here for that convention. I swear! All I wanted to do was clean up the room. I don't know anything about dope! +++$+++ 1990s
No, dammit! I mean me! That Rembrandt...that Rembrandt! +++$+++ 1990s
Relax. Make your mind a blank. +++$+++ 1980s
Why? +++$+++ 2000s
Come on. I want you. You're mine. You're mine! Come on! +++$+++ 1950s
Do you feel well enough for that? +++$+++ 1970s
Yes? +++$+++ 1970s
Yeah, the guy owes Momo a few G's. +++$+++ 1990s
Right. +++$+++ 1990s
Now who the hell is going to do that for me? +++$+++ 1980s
It strikes me that Eve's disloyalty and ingratitude must be contagious! +++$+++ 1950s
She looked dead. Still does. +++$+++ 1990s
Granville's looking for you anyway. +++$+++ 1970s
What happened? +++$+++ 2000s
Yeah. +++$+++ 1970s
Name the killer in HALLOWEEN. +++$+++ 1990s
Strange, that I have not. I wonder if your feelings on this matter are clear, Lord Vader. +++$+++ 1980s
So am I. +++$+++ 1990s
Oh yes. +++$+++ 1990s
You are so completely unbalanced. +++$+++ 1990s
Nobody's gonna take your baby. Know why?  Nobody cares...  Except me.  You wanna go back to your farm. You wanna go back to your family. I could take care of that baby. I'll look after her like she was me own. +++$+++ 1980s
Coming right to us! +++$+++ 1970s
Well, I'll get it from the safe. +++$+++ 1940s
What do you mean, what is it? It's some political bullshit. +++$+++ 1970s
Or sometimes not at all. +++$+++ 1990s
OK... whatever. +++$+++ 1990s
Some people aren't the athletic type. +++$+++ 1970s
Yes, sir. +++$+++ 2000s
France. +++$+++ 1970s
You'd die for fun? +++$+++ 1990s
No. Things are too hot. Later. I'll send for you. +++$+++ 1990s
Who?  Bond?  Bond is dead. +++$+++ 1990s
Whacking? +++$+++ 1980s
What do you mean, next? +++$+++ 1970s
I don't have to.  You'll be bustin' in on the Chief of Police just up the hall. +++$+++ 1970s
Well -- I -- +++$+++ 1990s
Oh. +++$+++ 1990s
That is of no interest. +++$+++ 1990s
Can't get off that shitty dump they live on.  What little money comes in goes to booze. +++$+++ 1990s
It's the best seat in the house. I warmed it up for you. +++$+++ 2000s
I know. They're rich drug addicts and celebrities. When I saw James Taylor there, and -- +++$+++ 1990s
There's this girl, this friend of mine from work that I think is really cute and really cool and I want you to meet her so I was thinking about bringing her to the party tonight. +++$+++ 2000s
I wouldn't worry about it. You've gotta figure most people around here were their teachers' pets. +++$+++ 2000s
Tell me the first thing that comes to your mind. +++$+++ 1990s
I will not permit any further testing on the eve of a mission.  We're already counting backwards. +++$+++ 1990s
So? +++$+++ 1950s
I know, Honey, but just think how exiting it will be-- new house, new school, new friends-- +++$+++ 1990s
You want another one of these, too? +++$+++ 1990s
You got Bank Americard? +++$+++ 1970s
David, I'm sorry I upset you yesterday, but you must understand what is going on. +++$+++ 1980s
Thanks, Mr. Gittes. +++$+++ 1970s
He is my defeated foe! +++$+++ 2000s
I don't know--let's break some windows. +++$+++ 1990s
Right back where we started. +++$+++ 2000s
You’re not playing with little boys now, scumbag. Where is the Austrian? +++$+++ 1990s
What are you doing ? +++$+++ 2000s
Yes. Can I - could I help you, in any way? +++$+++ 1980s
Bill...  ... where are you going? To find Eve? +++$+++ 1950s
You gonna jump?  Or are you just having a last look? +++$+++ 1990s
I-I'm sorry, Sam. +++$+++ 1990s
She's a little jealous, I think. And confused when it comes to men...  So where are we going? +++$+++ 2000s
Johnny... +++$+++ 1980s
That's not what I'm talking about, Pete. I'm talking about waking up and realizing this girl's gonna die. +++$+++ 2000s
Okay. +++$+++ 1990s
They're already dead.  They can't feel a thing. +++$+++ 1980s
Did you know about Bastaldi's deal with Zammito? +++$+++ 2000s
...I thought we agreed, no anti- Semitism...it's exactly what we're trying to put behind us.... Trash the blacks, fine; but... +++$+++ 2000s
Your words drove Bouchon to -- +++$+++ 2000s
I was looking for the Lieutenant Singh. +++$+++ 1990s
Sorry to interrupt you, sir, but I thought you'd like to know. +++$+++ 2000s
I can't do it. +++$+++ 1990s
I am all right, mama. That's why I called, to let you know. I gotta go. +++$+++ 1990s
A varied list of attractions. And which would you like to see first, Dan'l? +++$+++ 2000s
Hello.  Kay? +++$+++ 1970s
Madame Vice president. We have an options paper.  chandler takes the options paper, waves off Lee, and reads it as she talks. +++$+++ 1990s
I didn't know the people who gave them to me. +++$+++ 1970s
That's ridiculous. +++$+++ 1990s
What?  What did you say? +++$+++ 1990s
Erica. So do you think you and I are alike, Erica? +++$+++ 1990s
What do you think?  I left it on the curb? +++$+++ 1990s
Are you having a bad dream? +++$+++ 1980s
How about trying your fine Italian hand? +++$+++ 1930s
We're all getting a bit long in the tooth. +++$+++ 1990s
Let me see the map. +++$+++ 1990s
Yes. It has. +++$+++ 1970s
You really think so? +++$+++ 2000s
Please don't make me say it again. +++$+++ 1990s
Yes - +++$+++ 1990s
Maybe I do.  ...What a fuckin' mess, huh?  People can change Brian. +++$+++ 1990s
Not me, sir. Mr. Merrick. He succeeded in spite of my shortsightedness. +++$+++ 1980s
Cigarettes, candy bars...  PCP, crack... +++$+++ 1980s
Hey, man, gimme some skin. +++$+++ 1990s
Beynon. +++$+++ 1970s
Snuff clip.  It was Iris.  She said she needed my help and I... aw Jesus, Mace... the sick fucker killed her. +++$+++ 1990s
Sure. Why? +++$+++ 2000s
Excuse me. +++$+++ 1990s
We're gonna talk. +++$+++ 1990s
Call ya later. +++$+++ 2000s
Nicky. I was thinking about you. I went to the preview last night. +++$+++ 2000s
It was Henry Follett. +++$+++ 1990s
I don't think so. +++$+++ 1970s
No! +++$+++ 2000s
Rick? +++$+++ 1940s
Oh? What do you do to make ends meet? +++$+++ 1970s
Mazel Tov! +++$+++ 2000s
I'm booted up.  Go, Ethan. +++$+++ 2000s
What is that? +++$+++ 2000s
And don't apologize.  Every time I try to talk to someone it's sorry this and forgive me that and I'm not worthy and ... What are you doing now? +++$+++ 1970s
How come in former lifetimes, everybody was someone famous?  How come nobody ever says they were Joe Schmo? +++$+++ 1980s
Would you like to go for a walk? +++$+++ 1930s
So, he knows where you are. That means he's sending some guys over here probably right now. +++$+++ 1990s
Seven hundred for the pair. +++$+++ 1990s
OK. Roger. +++$+++ 1990s
What am I going to to do with this guy?  Pierce, I was just on the phone with Borough Command. Out of twelve shifts this month, you've been late for nine, sick four and that includes the shift where you came late and went home early. +++$+++ 1990s
Who is it? +++$+++ 1990s
Shut up! +++$+++ 1980s
You talkin' to me about Ramada Inn? +++$+++ 2000s
Find something? +++$+++ 1980s
Don't kid me.  You don't think she murdered Mitchell. +++$+++ 1990s
I am not -- I just think it'd be funny to see what he'd do... +++$+++ 2000s
Don't do that, man, okay? +++$+++ 1990s
Before he lost his powers of speech, he told me his one comfort was that he would live to know Wallace was dead. +++$+++ 1990s
To be honest Mary Sue. I didn't think you'd want to come here until we'd been pinned for a little while. +++$+++ 1990s
She is here. +++$+++ 2000s
Yeah? No kidding. Listen, you still want to go girl hunting tonight? +++$+++ 1990s
Moving along -  A typical plastic security card. Name here, magnetic information stripe here -  And a code breaking microprocessor here. Swipe it through any card reader - anywhere - you're in. +++$+++ 1990s
If you really want to do something for me, you can stop making this scene right now. +++$+++ 2000s
That's swell. However, the music, if you want to pursue it, well, the lessons from Mrs Swan, they'll only take you so far. There's this guy in San Francisco, I've made inquiries, everybody says he's the best. Trained lots of people who've gone on to have big concert careers, symphony orchestras, the works. His name is Jacques Carcanogues. I'm not sure I'm pronouncing it right. Anyway, he's a Frenchman. +++$+++ 2000s
I'm sorry, it's just that... I was told to wake you up gently, so I figured... +++$+++ 1990s
No place special.  Just hanging out. +++$+++ 1970s
What? +++$+++ 1960s
Yes. +++$+++ 1930s
You okay -- ? +++$+++ 2000s
Gregoire it is good to see you back to work. +++$+++ 2000s
What? +++$+++ 1980s
Open it. +++$+++ 1990s
Sure!  Sure, I'm on my way. +++$+++ 1960s
Could she be doin' okay, Johnnie? She's tryin' to prove somethin' to me, that's all. Lula ain't doin' no more'n showin' off, defyin' me...  Johnnie, I've done somethin' bad... +++$+++ 1990s
Harry, if I gave you Leo's money you'd have Ray Bones all over your ass and then you'd be in a whole new kinda trouble. +++$+++ 1990s
Sure.  Can I ask you one more thing? You haven't published anything in a while.  How come? +++$+++ 1990s
And look what happened to that. +++$+++ 1990s
Who was the other man? +++$+++ 1940s
This is Barry. +++$+++ 2000s
Just come to the Mudd Club on Friday. +++$+++ 1990s
Did you look for his passport, driving licence? +++$+++ 1990s
Shit!  I... I, which way? +++$+++ 1990s
So he knows your name? +++$+++ 1990s
What is it, Rakonin? Did you lose your job? +++$+++ 1930s
Can't be much of a crime, if all they got minding the area is a cocky kid. +++$+++ 1990s
Is it still dripping? +++$+++ 1970s
I am interested in the Eiffel Tower from a technical standpoint. +++$+++ 1930s
The kids are grown! They don't need you anymore. You told me that. They hardly talk to you. +++$+++ 1990s
I'm up for that... +++$+++ 1990s
What? +++$+++ 1980s
I'm sorry if I've ruined your day, Mr. Reynard. But my client's had a rough eight years behind bars and -- +++$+++ 1980s
Jeez, I don't know where you're ever going to find a guy like that. +++$+++ 1990s
I'm telling ya, it's over.  We used it all up-- +++$+++ 1990s
There's somethin' funny going on around here. +++$+++ 1940s
He's a goddamn drug dealer! These are his peak hours. +++$+++ 2000s
Halden sent men to kill me in my sleep, but simple illusions won out.  So he now sends the legend to finish the deed. +++$+++ 1920s
Torture cage.  Can't stand... can't sit... for days.  Sometimes weeks. +++$+++ 1980s
Why not? +++$+++ 1990s
Ah-ha.  So what is that--a radio? +++$+++ 1990s
Right. Planes get hit by lightning. They get hit by meteors. They hit other planes. +++$+++ 1990s
...a case, so, so <u>fascinating</u>, so... +++$+++ 2000s
Clarissa. Oh. Uh-huh.  Well, Saunders--let's go-- +++$+++ 1930s
Ain't that something? +++$+++ 1990s
Don't worry, Milo. I'm here as a friend. Or maybe a supplicant. +++$+++ 2000s
What's Doug do in Chicago? +++$+++ 1980s
I've been wondering if maybe Jack shot Twombley, instead of Twombley shooting himself. I've been wondering maybe Jack shot him on purpose. +++$+++ 1990s
Sure.  Bettina Peterson.  Marfa, Texas. Let's run a current check. +++$+++ 2000s
Not down in my parts. +++$+++ 1990s
So she flies - +++$+++ 2000s
No more drugs.  Please... +++$+++ 1990s
Ms.  Mitchell.  So nice to finally meet you in person. +++$+++ 1990s
See Threepio!  Do you copy? +++$+++ 1970s
All right, but present it to him as a great cause for the common man. +++$+++ 1940s
Alan! +++$+++ 1980s
I mean -- about my getting a divorce. +++$+++ 1960s
If his girlfriend was knocked up. +++$+++ 1990s
How you doing, Bob? +++$+++ 1990s
You know how when we close up, I close the register, then you lower the shades, then I turn out the lights, then we both lock the doors. +++$+++ 1990s
I know, man. +++$+++ 1950s
That's what I wanted you to tell me. +++$+++ 2000s
The last time he come in here. You hear that, Nick? +++$+++ 1940s
Good. Then may I have the honor of extending an invitation to you? +++$+++ 1990s
Why you nitwit. You almost destroyed the most sensitive deal of my career! +++$+++ 1990s
Right. Seven.  Christ, that’s a long time, isn’t it? +++$+++ 2000s
Man, is this interesting. +++$+++ 1960s
They all like this in your family, father? +++$+++ 1990s
It's not just Sid 6.7's performances that are increasing. Stars need bigger and bigger audiences.  Whatever Sid is going to do next, it's going to involve media. +++$+++ 1990s
Laurence! +++$+++ 1990s
Tattoo. Had it taken off. +++$+++ 1970s
--sorry--got an appointment to play shuffle-board. +++$+++ 1930s
Yes, you. We're looking for our room... 1002. +++$+++ 1980s
We pushed it. We got lazy. +++$+++ 2000s
I know, but -- +++$+++ 1990s
So you see what I'm <u>saying</u>...the movie is about <u>purity</u>... +++$+++ 2000s
What’s in it for me? Where are my Mary Janes? +++$+++ 2000s
The bastard.  He can blow his nose all the way. +++$+++ 1970s
For a celebrated bounder, that is an awful admission. Besides, I never knew that any female could do this to you . +++$+++ 1930s
Franky can't make it. He had an appointment he forgot, he's going to see you later. I'm Mickey Morrissey, we're supposed to get to know each other. +++$+++ 1980s
It's for wheat. We've always grown maize in the strip above the vegetables. +++$+++ 1960s
Everything's fine, honey. We don't need to talk. Besides I have to work late. +++$+++ 2000s
Objection, Your Honor. This isn't about Mrs. Rexroth's filial obligations. +++$+++ 2000s
Nah, he's nothin'. It's just sometimes... sometimes you just gotta punch somebody out, y'know? +++$+++ 1990s
You look sharp. You understand? +++$+++ 1980s
Shit! +++$+++ 2000s
You know I have lectured at the University of Maryland in your country?  Also University Michigan Very nice country. We both go back. +++$+++ 1970s
Gaston! +++$+++ 1930s
I'm not acting!  I don't want to go in it, okay? +++$+++ 1980s
The death of my father. +++$+++ 1990s
I don't question the legality of what you do.  It's your morality that makes me sick.  I will not allow my company to be raped by a man like you. +++$+++ 1990s
Not tonight no more. He ain't coming. Uh, he went home. +++$+++ 1940s
What's that, written on the sail? +++$+++ 2000s
The poet...something he said... +++$+++ 1980s
You're going to throw away our life together for some shared experience with a looney-tune that you misguidedly think is love? +++$+++ 2000s
So go shower already. +++$+++ 2000s
Can it work? +++$+++ 2000s
Are you ok? +++$+++ 1990s
What for?  I can say anything I want with my eyes. +++$+++ 1950s
No. I couldn't. +++$+++ 1990s
-- and this is confidential? +++$+++ 2000s
Professor, if something does go wrong tonight... if I don't get my parents back together... when do you think I'd cease to exist? +++$+++ 1980s
All I'm saying is that Amity is a summer town -- we need summer dollars, and if they can't swim here, they'll use the beaches at Cape Cod, or Long Island. +++$+++ 1970s
Your <u>shoes</u> cost a thousand dollars? +++$+++ 1990s
Ha ha... +++$+++ 1980s
NO! GOD, NO... +++$+++ 1990s
I still ain't sure what my daddy looks like. +++$+++ 1990s
Sleep is all stress reduction. Here.  You take one of these, sleep two hours, that's all you need.  Why do you think I'm telling you this, Frank--for my health?  You ought to look at yourself in the mirror, man. Kanita, get him a glass of water. +++$+++ 1990s
So, what are you seeing? +++$+++ 1990s
The blood type on the rocks matches Suzie's. +++$+++ 1990s
Put me down for ten, you louse. +++$+++ 1950s
You lame or something? +++$+++ 1980s
He said that the shit could get hot, could get heavy... I said good.  'Cuz I got two of the hottest, heaviest bitches alive. +++$+++ 2000s
That's right. +++$+++ 1990s
-- Don't tell me where you're going. +++$+++ 1940s
Of course. +++$+++ 1980s
Why should I be afraid of you? What are you holding over me? +++$+++ 1940s
He's retarded's all. You know he's always after a father figure and Lord knows Doyle ain't a good one with his mean ass. +++$+++ 1990s
I'm telling you, Animal, these Nazis ain't Kosher. +++$+++ 1950s
Oh don't.  Everyone says that. +++$+++ 2000s
Oh that makes a lot of sense. Why would I rat myself out? +++$+++ 1990s
Is that a game? +++$+++ 1980s
We did it. +++$+++ 1980s
Let us explore it together. +++$+++ 1980s
I heard about the Kentucky gag order... +++$+++ 1990s
Something's wrong. I know it.  I've heard rumors of cholera spreading south from Hamburg. +++$+++ 1930s
Goodbye. +++$+++ 1980s
I'm so hungry. +++$+++ 2000s
You want me to bring the VCR over here so we can watch this? +++$+++ 1990s
No... no, excuse me Eve. As quickly as I see fit. +++$+++ 1980s
Wise one, the French fathers made peace and swore to their honor not to break the friendship. Magua broke it. It is false that the French would not be friends, still, to the Huron. +++$+++ 1970s
Nothing. +++$+++ 1990s
Highly suspect. +++$+++ 1990s
Bite? +++$+++ 1980s
You know that's not true. +++$+++ 2000s
It's running three meters down. Twenty knots. +++$+++ 2000s
For defending my honor this afternoon. +++$+++ 1970s
Pure idiot. +++$+++ 2000s
Captain, we can't see her, but she gives off heat... +++$+++ 1990s
Yeah. You? +++$+++ 1990s
It's her, isn't it? +++$+++ 1990s
I don't know. +++$+++ 1970s
Where is she?! +++$+++ 1990s
Get your people out of there or I will. +++$+++ 1990s
That I am not Rheya.  That Rheya died.  Killed herself.  I'm different. +++$+++ 2000s
I thought you were living in San Francisco. Or was it Nepal? +++$+++ 2000s
Yes. +++$+++ 1940s
You might be better off legally as well as financially to just go for the -- +++$+++ 1990s
You were supposed to go downstairs, baby. +++$+++ 1990s
What's that? A Democrat with an attitude! +++$+++ 2000s
Pelting down out there. +++$+++ 2000s
Beauty and fragrances. +++$+++ 2000s
I just can't, son--not the head and tail both! +++$+++ 1930s
Yes, it was -- I ended up -- +++$+++ 1990s
Where do you think Jerry is? +++$+++ 1990s
Inspector Halloran, Homicide.  I'm in charge here. +++$+++ 1990s
I can't afford to make exceptions. Once word leaks out that a pirate has gone soft, people begin to disobey you, and then it's nothing but work, work, work, all the time. +++$+++ 1980s
All right, darling. +++$+++ 2000s
I can smell it. +++$+++ 1990s
What can I say? +++$+++ 1970s
Hey, boy - I'm talkin' to you. +++$+++ 1960s
I know.  That was for the smell. +++$+++ 2000s
I'm sorry. I didn't mean to upset you... but you still didn't answer the question. +++$+++ 1990s
It would have been so easy to let him in as you went out. +++$+++ 1990s
May I remind you that Duncan has the <u>client</u> arriving at exac... +++$+++ 1990s
Is that all... think real hard. +++$+++ 2000s
Nah, they'd shut down the pin number. +++$+++ 1990s
Mav's a great flyer but.... +++$+++ 1980s
It's the cops.  Shit! +++$+++ 1970s
Oh come on Harry, we're talking about five days here. +++$+++ 1990s
Yes. +++$+++ 1990s
There, what? I didn't see anything. +++$+++ 2000s
What is that, Mahogany? What happens if you crack the neck? +++$+++ 2000s
So they tell us.  But what are we to believe when the king is a tyrant, and the Church, meant to stand for all those oppressed, has become the tool of oppression?  When no conscience is tolerated?  No dissent, no objection? +++$+++ 1990s
If we move in a group, we are one target. If we scatter, they CAN'T get us all. +++$+++ 2000s
Command, Eagle One. Switching to "sidewinders." We're moving in. +++$+++ 1990s
Nix. +++$+++ 1990s
Forgive me, but it really is intoxicating being a news source. +++$+++ 1980s
You're leaving tomorrow? +++$+++ 1970s
Not mad, but bound more than a mad-man is; Shut up in prison, kept without my food, Whipp'd and tormented. Good day, good fellow. +++$+++ 1960s
Hi, Rob and Carrie. +++$+++ 2000s
Then do you understand that I cannot tell the truth here?  In Dallas. That there are people here who do not want me to tell the truth... who do not want me to have a retrial? +++$+++ 1990s
You know I liked it better long. +++$+++ 1960s
Just what I had in mind.  Everything dead on Earth except us.  A chance for mother nature to start again.  Plants and flowers are the oldest species on the planet yet they are defenseless against man.  Sorry hon, this is for science.  Behold the dawn of a new age. +++$+++ 1940s
Ain't you gonna look back, Ma?--give the ol' place a last look? +++$+++ 1940s
Hey, Chinese people have this energy field that vibrates at a particular frequency. +++$+++ 1980s
Oh!  I didn't see you there, sneaky boy!  You're like a boy sneaking in... +++$+++ 2000s
But I thought -- +++$+++ 1990s
Why? +++$+++ 2000s
Well get used to it, 'cause here we are, on the cruise of a lifetime. +++$+++ 1990s
Check forging. +++$+++ 1990s
Could you help me-- what was the name of that girl who just came in... +++$+++ 1990s
Well...I guess it's okay for me to tell you now.  That reputation of his isn't going anywhere.  Finch comes to me and says, "Jessica, I need help with this, blah blah, etcetera."  So I told him, pay me two- hundred bucks, and I'll tell a couple girls that you're dynamite in bed.  So he did, and I did. +++$+++ 1990s
Fuck you, too.  Pardon my French. +++$+++ 1990s
Sometimes she can be quite careless. Why don't you try Mrs. Redi? +++$+++ 1940s
Do you believe she really saw them? +++$+++ 1980s
Huh? +++$+++ 1990s
Interesting. +++$+++ 2000s
The Justice Department guy who came to the apartment when -- +++$+++ 2000s
Okay.  I'll meet you at the dock in ten minutes. +++$+++ 1990s
Chill out Edgar. +++$+++ 1980s
Romeo Tango Zulu1 this is Tower. +++$+++ 1990s
Dr. Weir, what's this the door to? +++$+++ 1990s
I don't wanna think.  I wanna drink. +++$+++ 1980s
You drew this?! +++$+++ 2000s
Well, she went somewhere! She didn't just up and disappear into thin air! +++$+++ 1990s
Bitch... You little bitch! +++$+++ 1990s
She didn't want me to be a climber. She wanted me to be a planner like her. +++$+++ 2000s
I want... I want to... +++$+++ 2000s
That's right. +++$+++ 1970s
I bought him a watch too. +++$+++ 1990s
Who's Lednov? +++$+++ 1940s
You fainted last night after supper. The master and I carried you here. +++$+++ 1960s
I'm sorry. She misunderstood, that's all. +++$+++ 1980s
How do you turn this thing off? +++$+++ 1990s
We can't leave him out here, open the door. +++$+++ 1970s
Not too expensive -- I'm not a lady of leisure anymore. +++$+++ 1960s
So then what, Mr. Wandering Jack? +++$+++ 1990s
Mr. President, there is another possibility we haven't considered. This may not be a coup at all. +++$+++ 2000s
There's nothing sudden about that—  He's always loved the girl, but he was such a sap he didn't have sense enough to tell her. Well, that's all right - we can fix that. He will go to the little O'Brien girl, and - here, I'll show you. +++$+++ 1930s
Who won? +++$+++ 1930s
Um, uh, butt... um, hole. Butt-hole... +++$+++ 1990s
I insist. +++$+++ 2000s
I just don't think it's right, killing an innocent girl. +++$+++ 1980s
This is the greatest moment of your life and you're off somewhere, missing it. +++$+++ 1990s
It was ridiculous; all this at three o'clock in the morning. +++$+++ 2000s
You were? I thought you were chasing me? +++$+++ 1940s
No.  JP.  My last boyfriend?  He like owns the club.  You know?  You were there?  He bought the statue. +++$+++ 1990s
Gone. +++$+++ 1990s
Last time I saw you, weren't you up for some equity-waiver thing? +++$+++ 1990s
See, Frank's being smart about this. +++$+++ 2000s
I'm going to miss you. +++$+++ 2000s
...When did you know all this? +++$+++ 2000s
No false modesty, lad.  You're a proper champion.  Achilles' armor sits on you like it was forged to fit. +++$+++ 1980s
Once in a while, you know. I mean, you know, every now- +++$+++ 1970s
So you sat it out, that's what you did? +++$+++ 1990s
Wait a minute - let me out. +++$+++ 1940s
H'ya, Carl--h'ya, Bill! +++$+++ 1930s
I know, I met him. +++$+++ 1980s
I had to inspect the merchandise first. +++$+++ 2000s
Your parents would want you to be in bed. +++$+++ 1990s
"Why?" If I asked questions like that, I'd never make love-"love"-- Damn you, Damn this, damnit! +++$+++ 2000s
For God's sake, tell him I'm on my way.  Let's go, Chucky.  A police escort is gonna pick us up en route.  You too, LaPlante. +++$+++ 1990s
Thanks, man.  I've been hating myself for the last two days. +++$+++ 1990s
Oh, I'd say about -- +++$+++ 1990s
Thank you for at least sounding sincere. +++$+++ 2000s
What am I supposed to do? +++$+++ 1970s
Big giant <u>capacitor</u>.  And that, instead of generating power it'll sort of be --  -- <u>sucking</u> power, from Gotham City, and storing it ... stockpiling it, sort of?  Which, unless I'm being dense, is a novel approach, I'd say. +++$+++ 1990s
A date. What, are you a hooker?  What do you mean a date?  I've got a wife back home. I just came over to talk for a few minutes. +++$+++ 1990s
So what do you suggest, we go to a hotel? We got a guy who's shot in the belly, he can't walk, he bleeds like a stuck pig, and when he's awake, he screams in pain. +++$+++ 1990s
No whistles, but a Club You bring a hack -- ? +++$+++ 2000s
What do you mean? +++$+++ 1980s
The creature!? Are you sure!? +++$+++ 1990s
I didn't kill my wife. +++$+++ 2000s
Why there? +++$+++ 1990s
Exactly.  Why not bring them? +++$+++ 1990s
What common objects? +++$+++ 1970s
Like hell they wouldn't. +++$+++ 1960s
Charlie, just because a man and his family are colored, you-- +++$+++ 1970s
He was in the bank yesterday. +++$+++ 1930s
INT. POSTAL VAN - DAY. +++$+++ 1990s
<i>New York Times</i>...? +++$+++ 2000s
I don't believe you have "things." +++$+++ 2000s
I had a partner and she fucked me. +++$+++ 1990s
We got you...it's okay, it's okay...we got you now.... +++$+++ 2000s
You'll get blown outta here some day. +++$+++ 1970s
You like him, don't you?  Your voice changes. +++$+++ 1990s
You quit trying to stop anybody— +++$+++ 1930s
Demons... This wouldn't have been possible without you... You have given me incentive ELLEN - I can see clearer now... +++$+++ 1990s
Dog tags. [Off her blank look] They've got your name and date of birth for identification. +++$+++ 2000s
Yes, I can tell that just looking around.  "Boy?"  Did you say you were a "country boy?" +++$+++ 1990s
I have committed no sin. +++$+++ 1980s
I killed him!  I killed him! +++$+++ 1980s
Okay +++$+++ 2000s
Devil's confusion. What's this I hear about you not getting out of bed?  I saw Denver. She tell you? +++$+++ 1990s
But the idea's good, if we could just turn it around somehow. +++$+++ 1970s
I feel like such a tramp - taking jewelry from a man under false pretenses. +++$+++ 1950s
Miles? You're scaring me. +++$+++ 2000s
I'm just going to get some ice. +++$+++ 1950s
I don't think we can treat this as a formality.  Mr. Kennedy made a verbal promise to the Russians not to invade Cuba.  But you authorized Dr. Kissinger to put this in writing. +++$+++ 1990s
You never have dessert. +++$+++ 1980s
Always. +++$+++ 1990s
Jesus... this is inhuman.  Uh... I wasn't told of any operations in this area. They shouldn't have been here. +++$+++ 1980s
Elizabeth!?!  'Can't waits any longer.  Arrive in your arms at ten tonight.' Oh, God!  Not tonight. +++$+++ 1970s
Yes?  Yes? +++$+++ 2000s
Yeah.  It was a rush thing.  They needed some documents down at the court house.  I barely made it. +++$+++ 1990s
Goodnight to you, Susan. +++$+++ 1990s
Look. All I want is a haircut. I'm not worried about this guy. +++$+++ 2000s
Henslowe, you have no soul so how can you understand the emptiness that seeks a soulmate? +++$+++ 1990s
They've got Quaid!  They're protecting him! +++$+++ 1990s
My marriage is the worst. All crap. A big pile of shit. +++$+++ 1980s
How nice. You remembered. But of course, that was the day the Germans marched into Paris. +++$+++ 1940s
And big for his age. +++$+++ 1980s
Gotta be here someplace.  Thought I heard a couple of dead Christians singing down there. +++$+++ 1970s
So what?  So what?  For starters, how about littering is a crime. +++$+++ 1990s
Just below ten thousand. +++$+++ 1980s
I'll go and get my valise. +++$+++ 1960s
Checking connection. +++$+++ 1920s
No.  What you do today? +++$+++ 2000s
Let's go.  Everybody take off? +++$+++ 1990s
I just called to say that I'm having a really great time. +++$+++ 1990s
By your Austrian? +++$+++ 1990s
You'll get over it. We've got a knockdown, airtight, motherfucker of a lawsuit against Sandra Van Ryan. +++$+++ 1990s
About what? +++$+++ 1990s
What do we do? +++$+++ 1990s
I've been ordered into bed.  The doctor says I've gotten the flu, or some other wretched ailment. +++$+++ 1990s
We know there's got to be something or they wouldn't be so panicked. +++$+++ 1970s
Arnie, this is crazy. +++$+++ 2000s
Why you say that?  Just because I help a lady with her package? +++$+++ 1990s
Who is this? +++$+++ 1990s
Me?  How would I know?  The only reason she ran off was to get away from her rather sizable debt to me. +++$+++ 1990s
I don't know. Maybe we should have moved. +++$+++ 1990s
Check the permits.  It was built as a guesthouse.  It's a legally rentable unit grandfathered when South Laguna was incorporated. +++$+++ 2000s
Hell, no! I just got something in my eye. +++$+++ 2000s
Yeah-well, you wanted to keep the relationship flexible, remember? It's your phrase. +++$+++ 1970s
Sent it. +++$+++ 1990s
Well, I'm sorry, I-I can't... I-I- I've gotta see a picture exactly from the start to the finish, 'cause- 'cause I'm anal. +++$+++ 1970s
What kinda beer do you like? +++$+++ 1990s
No. +++$+++ 2000s
Richard Taupin has become cumbersome.  It would be best if he just disappeared. +++$+++ 1980s
I'm not worried. +++$+++ 1990s
I found a broken gasket, from space -- +++$+++ 1990s
How'd you know he died, he tell you? +++$+++ 1990s
OTIS, your brain defies any known scientific laws in its infinite capacity to deteriorate. Every man has a vulnerable point. Some like you Otis, have more that one. I didn't see Superman's in time. But now through patience, invention and skill, my 	black box is just about ready. +++$+++ 1980s
I made no such promise.  Sound the retreat for the night! +++$+++ 2000s
Jesus! +++$+++ 2000s
Bet I do. +++$+++ 1980s
Uh-huh. While I was sitting there, trying to make my mind up, a cop stuck his head in the car, because I was illegally parked -- so I started to hide the gun under the seat and it went off -- pow! +++$+++ 1960s
Too young? +++$+++ 1990s
I gotta go. Love ya mom. +++$+++ 1990s
Mr. Sebastian is a host who wants to be appreciated.  We'll appreciate him and he'll cooperate. +++$+++ 1980s
I did kill us. She thinks we’re dead. And she thinks she got away with it. +++$+++ 1990s
Or something will be able to see us. +++$+++ 1970s
If there's gold.  If! +++$+++ 1990s
My name is Li Mu Bai.  The Green Destiny is mine.  Jade Fox can't be your master.  Where did you learn that "Xuan Piu" move? +++$+++ 2000s
What would be a good time for you? +++$+++ 2000s
After fifty years there ain't nothin' left but shoe leather. +++$+++ 2000s
Let me talk to Mickey. +++$+++ 1980s
Mom, please. +++$+++ 2000s
Can I help you? +++$+++ 1970s
Deserts you?  Harry said he'd take over for me. +++$+++ 1990s
When do we go? +++$+++ 2000s
Who are "they?" +++$+++ 1990s
Half - I'm comin' down. +++$+++ 1990s
That's funny - I never slept better.  And I had the most wonderful dream.  I was still on the yacht, and the anchor broke loose - and we drifted for days and days - you were the captain and I was the crew - I kept a lookout for icebergs, and I sorted your shells, and mixed your cocktails, and wiped the steam off your glasses - and when I woke up, I felt like swimming right back to you. +++$+++ 1950s
I asked you to wake me when Babe Brother comes. +++$+++ 1990s
That is a matter of opinion. +++$+++ 1990s
Don't do it. +++$+++ 1970s
I'm your future husband, remember? +++$+++ 1980s
I, uh... +++$+++ 2000s
Yes, but. +++$+++ 1980s
Oh, 'cause you got it like dat? +++$+++ 2000s
Loomis. Haddonfield. +++$+++ 1980s
Are you sure you...? +++$+++ 1990s
I'm telling you, I saw somebody. I don't know who it was. But I saw somebody. +++$+++ 2000s
That's not where I am.  Miller No? Where are you? +++$+++ 1990s
But you're not going to stop her? +++$+++ 1990s
Not at all. +++$+++ 1950s
It was futile. We went all over. +++$+++ 1960s
BETTY, I NEED TO TALK TO YOU... IN PERSON! WHERE'RE YOU AT? +++$+++ 2000s
Ahhh - no - stop - I mean Janet.  Janet. +++$+++ 1970s
Take it,easy, boy...  Seems to me you're different than a lotta boys that come to me. Most of 'em seem troubled, confused, but I'd say you knew exactly what you want. +++$+++ 1960s
Where the hell we going to get us a football team? +++$+++ 1970s
Maybe I am three-eighty-five if you carry a second lien!  I can arrange the most creative financing in the six states of New England. +++$+++ 1980s
What do you want? +++$+++ 1980s
No! +++$+++ 1980s
No. +++$+++ 1990s
Did you say Cable Junction? +++$+++ 1970s
I... have come to communicate with my User. +++$+++ 1980s
How'd they know who you were? +++$+++ 2000s
I told Regan that was holy water, I sprinkled some on her and she reacted very violently. It's tap water. +++$+++ 1970s
What? +++$+++ 1970s
Yeah? About fifty people I didn't know wrote that in my annual. +++$+++ 1980s
It's there! +++$+++ 1970s
How do you stop The Screamer? +++$+++ 1990s
Yes, it's lame. +++$+++ 1990s
From one professional to another, of course. +++$+++ 1990s
Want me to take over? +++$+++ 1970s
Who gave you this idea? What is responsible for all this? +++$+++ 1930s
Wait a minute - +++$+++ 1990s
Yes -- but I am afraid of being deceived. +++$+++ 1970s
I think you're fucking crazy! +++$+++ 1990s
In a moment. +++$+++ 1930s
Nope, you got a little surprise over there, Shorty. +++$+++ 1980s
You can tell that from here? +++$+++ 1950s
What? +++$+++ 1970s
Yeah, the sensitive guy-thing never worked for me. +++$+++ 2000s
Aye, OK, Fr.  But the good times couldn't last for ever. +++$+++ 1990s
You're possessive. +++$+++ 2000s
Just take a look at it. +++$+++ 1980s
Here. It looks like you need a refill. +++$+++ 1960s
You still didn't answer my question. +++$+++ 1960s
Ricky Hendricks has to cancel today. He didn't say what he was canceling or why. +++$+++ 2000s
If I weren't married? +++$+++ 2000s
We don't take hints. +++$+++ 2000s
Yeah.  The Inferno. +++$+++ 1990s
I just figured you was out bein' Mr. Cool... +++$+++ 1990s
Aloha! Welcome! +++$+++ 1990s
Fine.  Go home.  Who needs you. +++$+++ 2000s
Did you tell Veronica? +++$+++ 1990s
Had enough? +++$+++ 1970s
'Oughta give up smoking, Jocko. +++$+++ 1960s
Oh come on! +++$+++ 1990s
Easy to fix.  Wyatt Berry Stapp Earp. +++$+++ 1990s
1922. Why the kippers? +++$+++ 1990s
He left his sweater. +++$+++ 1990s
Handbook for the recently diseased. +++$+++ 1980s
Do I have to? +++$+++ 2000s
Okay. See you later, friend. +++$+++ 2000s
Cool. What'd it do to you guys? +++$+++ 2000s
Mind that shrapnel DAWN thrusts a brass regimental hat badge in BILL'S face. +++$+++ 1980s
Well, what do you think? +++$+++ 1990s
Jack, for crying out loud.  Your bachelorhood's showing.  Ah, here we go. +++$+++ 1980s
Why what? +++$+++ 1990s
Mr. Gordon— +++$+++ 1930s
Hid by day--fought by night.  At sunset one day, your father and I, peering through field glasses, saw a black Mercedes draw up to a village inn.  It was escorted by two motorcyclists and an armored car.  Out of the Mercedes stepped one of the most hateful men in all of history--the Beast of Yugoslavia. +++$+++ 1970s
Jim, I've got to go.  I'm already late-- +++$+++ 1970s
Don't you have a hockey game at two? +++$+++ 1990s
You're strapped into an implant chair, and I'm monitoring you at a psycho-probe console. +++$+++ 1990s
I said - try again. +++$+++ 1970s
No, I want to walk. +++$+++ 1960s
You want to give me your gun now, Plato? +++$+++ 1950s
What do you mean? +++$+++ 1960s
"He" wanted me to warn you.  Look at this, all of you! +++$+++ 1980s
That's okay -- really it is. +++$+++ 1990s
Hey, you hear about the chick that came in today? Said some chick bit her at Victoria's Secret. Bitches are outta control these days. +++$+++ 1980s
Yes. +++$+++ 1980s
Thank you, Baron. +++$+++ 1930s
Your lambs are still for now, Clarice, but not forever... You'll have to earn it again and again, this blessed silence. Because it's the plight that drives you, and the plight will never end. +++$+++ 1990s
Yes. We went to the address we were given and had to tie up the owner of the house who turns out to be some Mafia guy. +++$+++ 2000s
You bet I will, Ma. +++$+++ 1940s
It is unlikely. America, perhaps. There is great anti-communist feeling in America. +++$+++ 1990s
What with the psychosis and all, yeah. +++$+++ 1990s
Should I? +++$+++ 1990s
And you certainly shouldn't settle for anything less that you deserve. +++$+++ 1990s
You're pretty charming when you want to be. +++$+++ 1980s
From the lip wound, which happened seven hours before he got burned, we've narrowed it down to those cities within the seven-hour driving radius that also would've caught the 'Tattler' early Tuesday morning. +++$+++ 1980s
Why? +++$+++ 2000s
Not yet you know any of these people? +++$+++ 1980s
No, uh, nobody. It's, uh, it's my birthday this week and Sooze's brother might come by to wish me a happy birthday. +++$+++ 1990s
A very large pig. +++$+++ 1990s
No. +++$+++ 1990s
I am Lieutenant Dunbar. +++$+++ 1950s
Valcour. His chair. +++$+++ 2000s
There's a hawk around. They're scared tonight. +++$+++ 1950s
How long have you been married? +++$+++ 2000s
What?!  You aborted our child?! +++$+++ 2000s
Okay, I know you've suffered a terrible loss, and there's really nothing anyone can do to comfort you, but I urge you to focus on the times you had with the camper, the trips you took, the sights you saw, those days are gone now, but they'll live on in your heart forever. +++$+++ 1990s
Mrs. Stanwyk! +++$+++ 1980s
Let's mingle a little, shall we? +++$+++ 1990s
I am, Sir...Sergeant Al Powell. +++$+++ 1980s
Victor, your scar -- +++$+++ 1990s
So, there are rules.  Things you do and things you don't do. +++$+++ 1990s
What do you mean, old and ugly? +++$+++ 2000s
Does it cause drowsiness?  That's all we need.  To get him unconscious -- put him under. +++$+++ 1990s
It's been a while. +++$+++ 1980s
I'm dead. We're both dead. +++$+++ 1980s
Like firing Andrew Beckett taught <u>him</u> a lesson? +++$+++ 1990s
Please, hurry... +++$+++ 1980s
We're going to rope this banker tomorrow and you gotta at least look classy, if not be classy. You gotta do this thing and I don't even know if you can. +++$+++ 2000s
Redstone's the army training center in Alabama where they send the cream of the crop to learn about tickers. +++$+++ 2000s
All I knew, she was pulling away. It made me crazy. +++$+++ 2000s
Maybe by now they are. +++$+++ 1970s
Will you defy your father and your Queen? +++$+++ 1990s
Yeah! +++$+++ 1990s
So.  You found him. +++$+++ 1990s
How do you do? +++$+++ 1970s
I don't want it now. +++$+++ 1930s
Things worked out.  I made some money over there, had some laughs, you know. It was good. +++$+++ 1990s
I'm not your pupil.  I was, but I'm not. +++$+++ 1980s
Not that.  Us. +++$+++ 1990s
Came back three days ago. +++$+++ 1940s
Finish it up without the lip. +++$+++ 1990s
Can we take a dip? +++$+++ 2000s
It's okay.  What happened? +++$+++ 1970s
Well, Bruce -- I don't think -- that would be possible. +++$+++ 1980s
No, Waski, she won't die, because we are praying for her. +++$+++ 1990s
One. The radio's rappin' about $750^000. We only got a half a million. +++$+++ 1970s
No, you didn't! +++$+++ 1980s
What's so special about it? +++$+++ 2000s
I mean, seventy-five is too early, but at eighty-five, well, you're just marking time and you may as well look over the horizon. +++$+++ 1970s
I'm about to be killed and you "Shhh" me!  This wasn't my case, Lee.  Ricky Tan didn't kill my father, the Fu-Cang Long are not in South Central.  I didn't have to help you. +++$+++ 2000s
Later for that, Walt, let's get this:  we need the "pages" for the new "Old Mill"...alright?  We need a new title, we need a... +++$+++ 2000s
Now, lasher - it is our time. +++$+++ 1990s
Well to be honest, Etienne, I would rather have not known about it. +++$+++ 2000s
Ten bucks? Say, if I had ten bucks, I'd quit. +++$+++ 1930s
Well, if you had to do it, you had to do it. What we don't want is that bitch surviving on us. Anybody but that woman. +++$+++ 1990s
I have. Or there would be twice as many. +++$+++ 1990s
They're around. +++$+++ 1990s
I've got to hand it to the British, David. You know what those guys are?  Decent.  Tell me, Herr Dr. Furtwängler, do you know Hans Hinkel? +++$+++ 2000s
Jeez. And you think the British'll share it with their Allies? +++$+++ 2000s
Nicolet and Dargus stop me at the airport and mark the bills. +++$+++ 1990s
Rowan Mayfair. +++$+++ 1990s
Following me? +++$+++ 1990s
From over the mountain -- +++$+++ 2000s
Yes. +++$+++ 1930s
So you feel like you're stuck on a train you can't get off 'cause you're marryin' this fella. +++$+++ 1990s
I feel like I'm spying on Rick. +++$+++ 1980s
It is a hard decision to make -- but yours is only a technical responsibility... +++$+++ 1940s
I've got a lock!  There! +++$+++ 1990s
Dick Wilson? Dickie Wilson? Dickie Wilson runs this place? That's a laugh! +++$+++ 1980s
The match! +++$+++ 1990s
Is he a friend, then? +++$+++ 1980s
What do I know about Williams? +++$+++ 1940s
It would not be the same without you. +++$+++ 2000s
No. +++$+++ 1970s
It's been awhile. She didn't want me looking for my dad. +++$+++ 1990s
Lighten up Adam. Show some character. +++$+++ 1990s
I can't convince him. He's got such a thick head, I'd like to crack it open myself. Believe me, my own brother. It's very hard. You don't have to convince me -- I know we should be with Tommy. You talk to him. He don't listen to nobody. +++$+++ 1980s
Yeah. +++$+++ 1970s
Well, there are certain sections of New York, Major, that I wouldn't advise you to try to invade. +++$+++ 1940s
Oh my God! +++$+++ 2000s
Now, the Old Lady starts to <u>Weep</u>, Big Bird shrugs off his secret <u>Service</u>, goes to her, and covers her with his own coat. +++$+++ 1990s
The hatchery, in particular?  You know my initial yields had to be low, far less than one percent, that's a thousand embryos for every single live birth.  Genetic engineering on that scale implies a giant operation, not the spotless little laboratory I showed you. +++$+++ 1990s
I suppose this is going to sound absurd. I've only known you twenty-four hours, but I'm in love with you. +++$+++ 1930s
I didn't mean you. But just ordinary people. A guy I know -- Dough-Boy -- met his wife that way. They got to talking. She said she usually caught the bus so he started picking her up at the bus stop, taking her home with the flag up. +++$+++ 1970s
I got it.  And I took pictures of the new church for you, too. +++$+++ 1980s
Okay, thanks.  Um... you know, that's it. I'm sorry. +++$+++ 1990s
Kip… I - +++$+++ 1990s
What you're telling me is that I'm dead. Right? +++$+++ 1980s
...tunnel! +++$+++ 1990s
Of God. +++$+++ 1980s
Joey... +++$+++ 1990s
Childs. +++$+++ 2000s
Certainly, sir. How else can I keep my reputation as a miracle worker? +++$+++ 1980s
For what? +++$+++ 1990s
I'm going to go ahead and go now. +++$+++ 2000s
I was so scared. +++$+++ 1950s
Quintus will tell the army that you are being called to Rome to celebrate your victory.  They will hear that you are living in luxury. He will let them feel you have betrayed them for the good life. And soon the army won't even remember your name. +++$+++ 2000s
I thought I'd wait for you. +++$+++ 1980s
He calls it the Tarantula. +++$+++ 1990s
Which means -- +++$+++ 1990s
Lloyd, I love you, okay? +++$+++ 1980s
No, no.  It's fine. +++$+++ 2000s
Check. +++$+++ 1990s
She hasn't one into specifics yet, she's been waiting for you. +++$+++ 1990s
I try to moisturize regularly. +++$+++ 2000s
Look, I have to go. I have to think. +++$+++ 2000s
Who? Donnie and Marie? +++$+++ 1980s
That would take weeks. +++$+++ 2000s
A jogger, huh? +++$+++ 1990s
The man has friends. And they're not likely to forgive me if I testify against him. +++$+++ 1990s
Yeah.  Is that funny? +++$+++ 1990s
Ever go to church? +++$+++ 1980s
Well, you're perfect now. +++$+++ 1930s
What do we do with the Humvee? +++$+++ 1990s
Do I? Keaton was under indictment a total                 + of seven times when he was on the force.                  + In every case, witnesses either reversed                  + their testimony to the grand jury or died                 + before they could testify. When they                      t finally did nail him for fraud, he spent                  + five years in Sing Sing. He killed three prisoners inside - one with a knife in the tailbone while he strangled him to death. Of course I can't prove this but I can't prove the best part either. +++$+++ 1990s
Please, get on the bus... +++$+++ 1990s
Lost something? +++$+++ 1990s
I can't talk to you, you met my wife, I... +++$+++ 1990s
Why in the world would she t... +++$+++ 1990s
Where do you meet? +++$+++ 1980s
Why? +++$+++ 2000s
Man, can you scream. +++$+++ 1990s
No. +++$+++ 1930s
Because it's in English? +++$+++ 2000s
The usual, Barry. +++$+++ 1990s
You'd have to ask them. +++$+++ 1990s
That'll happen when you're about to spend thirty billion dollars on some aspirin... +++$+++ 2000s
Not padded ones. +++$+++ 1990s
It was for your own good, in a twisted sort of publicly humiliating way. +++$+++ 2000s
All right, I have detonation time at... Wait a minute, something's wrong with the clock.  All right, I have detonation time at... no, that can't be right, it says three years.  Okay, I have six minutes exactly. Does that check out down there? +++$+++ 1970s
Every mornin', every night I pass by -- I smile. I say jokes. Nothin'. She looks at me. +++$+++ 1970s
Oh, now, that's a great one! +++$+++ 1990s
What about the other night. What about last night?  Was that to get to know your character? +++$+++ 1990s
Yes. They pick fruit, all kinds. They travel up and down the coast with the seasons.  The trick to Mr. Rose is, you have to let him be the boss. +++$+++ 1990s
Looking back... I suppose it was. I didn't quite realize it at the time but... +++$+++ 2000s
At the store. You doin' some good? +++$+++ 1980s
You look... better. +++$+++ 1980s
Do you remember what just happened? +++$+++ 1980s
Well, no, look... I mean, there was a footprint. Forget it. It's probably not important at all.  You know, I got a job now. I'm teaching high school. Japanese and Chemistry.  So, what were you calling about? +++$+++ 1990s
What do you want me to say? +++$+++ 1990s
What magic have we on our side? +++$+++ 1980s
Well, I got it all planned... and I'm taking Holly off with me. +++$+++ 1970s
Jack Crawford sent a trainee to me? +++$+++ 1990s
No. We're going to lock this up and -- +++$+++ 1990s
Ehhh, you know those guys.  If he had his way, I'd be stuck in the hospital, running tests all day.  And anyway, I've found a new guy who's gonna be able to instantly remove the cancer. +++$+++ 1990s
Yes...<i>yes</i>... +++$+++ 1990s
I've got goose-bumps all over me. +++$+++ 1990s
Can't tell -- these weather conditions could erode anything, fast. +++$+++ 1970s
So you washed it off! +++$+++ 1930s
Twenty-two; same as us. +++$+++ 1990s
In seven years Jackie's never missed one of Tucker's parties. Where is she? +++$+++ 1990s
<u>Yes</u>, I'm sure. +++$+++ 1990s
Yes. +++$+++ 2000s
No one's forcing her. +++$+++ 2000s
Where have you been?!! +++$+++ 2000s
OK, Boss. +++$+++ 2000s
Well, at least I know what to name him.  I don't suppose you'd know who the father is? So I don't tell him to get lost when I meet him. +++$+++ 1980s
Yes, of course you are.  Well, Otho had an intuition.  Call it a hunch -- that it was going to be a fabled monstrosity of a house.  And it certainly is.  Charles, you're lucky the Yuppies are buying condos, so you can afford what I'm going to have to do to this place. We are talking <u>from the ground</u> <u>ups'ville</u>! +++$+++ 1980s
Yeah. +++$+++ 1990s
When you've got money, you'll pay. +++$+++ 1960s
You quitting? +++$+++ 2000s
He would not have spoken of it openly. +++$+++ 1980s
Gentlemen, the prosecution rests. +++$+++ 2000s
You're sick. You should go to the nurse. I'm going to tell Miss Dennis. +++$+++ 1980s
Oh, come off it, man. +++$+++ 1970s

What's the matter, Leo?  Don't you like Coney Island? +++$+++ 1960s

My lawyer?  Why do I need a lawyer? +++$+++ 1990s
What's up? +++$+++ 1930s

Nudie pictures, what do you think? +++$+++ 1990s
Burn??  Are you kidding?  It's freezing! +++$+++ 1980s

I wanted to congratulate you for the job you did on Mr. Lounds. I admired it enormously. What a cunning boy you are, Will. +++$+++ 1980s
With what? +++$+++ 2000s
You don't look so good.  You don't smell so good either. +++$+++ 1980s
I guess that's for the best. +++$+++ 1990s

No. +++$+++ 1920s
An accident at the mill? +++$+++ 1940s

It's on the table where I left it! What the hell are you doing?! Hurry up! +++$+++ 2000s

Any particular reason? +++$+++ 2000s
So, it is a blacklist. +++$+++ 2000s
A drink? I've got some nice gin. If you'd prefer something else, they'll send it up... +++$+++ 1960s
I don't understand. +++$+++ 1990s
Look, Harry's not part of this. He's just a sales rep. +++$+++ 1990s

Yah, that can happen. +++$+++ 1990s
Near Alexandria. It isn't in Alexandria, it is outside it. +++$+++ 1990s
Are you all right? +++$+++ 1960s
Pleasure is for those who seize it! Do you think those insipid, pale- skinned mortals will ever know such rapture? +++$+++ 1980s
Jesus.  About twelve more yards.  Keep coming just like that. +++$+++ 1990s
Why are you doing this to me? +++$+++ 1990s
--yeah, a hand or something-- +++$+++ 2000s
Mr. Streiger, speaking frankly -- we've appreciated the Sergeant's interest you know, all along. Here, locally. But New York, that's - well -- +++$+++ 1970s

Good evening, Mr. Newberry. +++$+++ 1990s

Jessica shifts, Paul sees it, and just as Stilgar begins a reach for his weapon, Jessica turns, slashes out, utters a SOUND, whirls again and with rock behind her holds Stilgar helpless in front of her -- her hand at his throat. Paul moves on her first move.  He races up a rocky incline. +++$+++ 1980s
Now, Wendell, did you inquire about the cylinder lock? +++$+++ 2000s
Try the desk. +++$+++ 1950s

Bloke told me. +++$+++ 1990s
Watch the first step. +++$+++ 1940s

Want me to breathe deeply? +++$+++ 1970s
I think you're trying to tell me something. +++$+++ 2000s
Oh! Madam is cancelling the engagement. Madam has chosen a funny time for such a funny joke. Ha, ha, ha -- hurry, come on. Tonight -- there's a line in front of the theatre since six o'clock. The house is jammed to the roof. +++$+++ 1930s
Newcomers working near methane gasses at oil refineries must paint it on their boots to protect against sparks. +++$+++ 1980s
The question is, does Brad want to see you?  Quite frankly, he hates you. +++$+++ 1980s
Yes, if you like.  Call me at work. +++$+++ 1980s
Yeah, I read your piece. It's very smart. And very wrong. +++$+++ 2000s
There was a break-in. +++$+++ 1990s
A fuckin' pink robe and a fuckin'... +++$+++ 1990s
Captain Miller, I just want to say... +++$+++ 1990s
Bruckner's Seventh. The Adagio. +++$+++ 2000s
You should have tried to get pregnant Marylin -- solidify your position. +++$+++ 2000s
Of course not!  And how is it you were nearby? +++$+++ 1970s
That's nice. +++$+++ 1950s
Might be, shit. Man, I know this town. I got my own fences. Who the hell are you? Who put you in charge? +++$+++ 1990s
Why? +++$+++ 1970s
Yeah, I'm sure. +++$+++ 1990s
Can't we hold him? +++$+++ 1990s
You've been waiting your chance. You're too much of a gentleman -- that's the trouble with you. +++$+++ 1930s
Sure, Paul.  No hard feelings. +++$+++ 1990s
Doesnit sleep? +++$+++ 2000s
Yes.  The bulldog's just gone to press. +++$+++ 1940s
Oh, my God. +++$+++ 1990s
I love it! +++$+++ 2000s
Please, Barton. +++$+++ 1990s
Like what? +++$+++ 1960s
True. +++$+++ 1990s
Good luck. +++$+++ 1980s
Are you going to see him? +++$+++ 1930s
Push and twist, it's child proof. +++$+++ 2000s
Helen. +++$+++ 1990s
No. I meant not to be angry with you, Sir Gahalt. In the idleness that comes with peace gossip has bread its own evil. You merely repeat it. Please, sir, have one of those apples that Lancelot loves, and in that gesture partake of its goodness. +++$+++ 1980s
Well, I can, and I love it! He forgets the office when he's with me. He doesn't treat me like an errand-boy -- he treats me like a woman. +++$+++ 1940s
What're you gonna get out of it, huh? +++$+++ 1960s
Certainly not mine. Come on. +++$+++ 1990s
Wheelchair accessible. +++$+++ 1990s
Yeah, I think he is.  Hey, Fred! +++$+++ 1980s
The bourbon.  The news about Ugarte upset me very much. +++$+++ 1940s
Wherever you like, Lutece, 21, the River Cafe...or maybe we can just drive around for a while.  Work up an appetite. +++$+++ 1980s
I miss those days, when schoolyard sexual harassment was without consequence. +++$+++ 2000s
Kick a buck. +++$+++ 1960s
Lovely. +++$+++ 2000s
Skipper, you can't do this! +++$+++ 1980s
You have a little boy.  He shows you his butterfly collection, plus the killing jar. +++$+++ 1980s
Thank you, sir. +++$+++ 1960s
I'm in love with your daughter, and I'm taking her with me tonight. +++$+++ 1990s
Thank you. +++$+++ 1940s
But there's no -- +++$+++ 1990s
Thanks. +++$+++ 1980s
It was pale...a shadowed gold. +++$+++ 1940s
Over there! +++$+++ 1950s
Then I called his house, and his mother told me he was in the garage helping his father. +++$+++ 1980s
Hey, by the way, I'm really sorry about your wife leavin' you. +++$+++ 2000s
It's their Presidential Suite. +++$+++ 1990s
Why, that's ridiculous! I was on that bus—I told them to wait! +++$+++ 1930s
Let's knock off early. Go to the mall. Something lame like that. +++$+++ 1980s
If you'll just maybe ease it into second. +++$+++ 1980s
Seeya tomorrow. +++$+++ 1990s
That was Marvin Untermeyer. +++$+++ 2000s
"Accident and Compensation" -- no one can accuse the firm of not supplying exactly what it promises. +++$+++ 1990s
I think we should go. +++$+++ 2000s
Put it on. +++$+++ 2000s
I want Reiben on B.A.R; Jackson with his sniper rifle; Beasley, demolition. +++$+++ 1990s
Then why? +++$+++ 1990s
They must be shielded somehow.  I'm sure the base is there. +++$+++ 1970s
Man's in town two days, thinks he's David O. fucking Selznick. +++$+++ 1990s
It's no big deal, right? +++$+++ 1990s
What happened? +++$+++ 2000s
Thank you for correcting my ignorance.  I'm looking forward to working side by side with you.  I feel we make a good team. +++$+++ 2000s
No, don't say anything else! +++$+++ 1980s
You plan on shooting that gun or just hugging it? +++$+++ 2000s
I'm not going. +++$+++ 1980s
How's that about your being my friend? +++$+++ 1950s
Somethin' like that. +++$+++ 2000s
You been to Japan? +++$+++ 1990s
You... fed on me? +++$+++ 1990s
Maybe you should back off. +++$+++ 2000s
Entertain yourself. +++$+++ 1980s
Sure.  But that's only when the love itself goes unchanged. +++$+++ 1980s
We object, Your Honor. It would unfairly influence the jury. +++$+++ 1990s
What's the matter? +++$+++ 2000s
That's even better. +++$+++ 1930s
Yeah. +++$+++ 1980s
Come on in. You wanna Ginseng Cooler? +++$+++ 2000s
Sorry, Stu. It's all part of the deal. We've got <u>big plans</u> for that body of yours! +++$+++ 2000s
And only then does our noble friend realize... +++$+++ 1990s
I don't trust anyone.  That's what comes of working in television. +++$+++ 1980s
Do guys actually believe their lame, self- serving excuses? +++$+++ 1990s
Yah. Yah. Home a Paul Bunyan and Babe the Blue Ox. +++$+++ 1990s
Funny, nobody calls it that anymore. Caesar calls it "The |Business." +++$+++ 1990s
She said they were from her old convent. +++$+++ 1990s
What the fuck are you doing? +++$+++ 1990s
No. I - I'm just curious, you know. I was wonderin' how much he would put into a thing like that. That's all. +++$+++ 1990s
-- Looks like a clear shot to the 'Bama State Line. +++$+++ 1970s
Now you're being rude, Shorty. +++$+++ 2000s
Sounds good. +++$+++ 1990s
Where's your elastic brace? +++$+++ 2000s
This whole place can't be wired to just one circuit -- +++$+++ 1990s
I'm so happy you like it.  I'm so relieved you said yes, and I'm really, um, what, thrilled, yes actually, to finally meet you. +++$+++ 2000s
Is it? +++$+++ 2000s
I just wanted to distract them. I wasn't trying to get a picture of you. +++$+++ 1980s
The radio rig is inside.  It runs directly from the geothermal generator, so power shouldn't be a problem. +++$+++ 1990s
They'll wait.  Meantime, raise the lid. +++$+++ 2000s
Duffy, go over and sit on Mulvihill.  Jesus Christ, I didn't tell you to bring the police department with you. +++$+++ 1970s
Try? +++$+++ 2000s
There's somebody lookin' for me. Not police. Just call me if anyone else checks in tonight. +++$+++ 2000s
<u>It's uncanny</u>. +++$+++ 1990s
Don't make my mistake, kid... don't...be a grunt...your whole life... +++$+++ 1990s
Met him through Santos... Clyde - your daddy - had some sorta business deal with Santos. +++$+++ 1990s
Very good. Now we play ROUND 2. +++$+++ 2000s
What was it? +++$+++ 1960s
So you did talk about it, huh? +++$+++ 1990s
Listen: when we get back tomorrow, you're gonna find Tully laying a promotion on you. S.A.C. He wants to prove that his yuppie agents are making good. He's offering you New York. Tell him you want Atlanta. +++$+++ 1990s
I'm not crazy. +++$+++ 1990s
Give it to him. +++$+++ 1990s
off the peg? +++$+++ 1990s
You will therefore be taken to the Dune Sea and cast into the pit of Carkoon, the nesting place of the all-powerful Sarlacc. +++$+++ 1980s
No question, no, you're right. We gotta do what's good for us now. +++$+++ 2000s
No. Just like an hour or so. +++$+++ 1990s
I know. Stop it. +++$+++ 2000s
By the way, you're getting a hell of a car there, mister. +++$+++ 1970s
You sure about this? +++$+++ 2000s
Because you were spoiled, don't try to spoil Sunny. +++$+++ 1990s
Well, there's a message on his answering machine saying he went to London. +++$+++ 2000s
Who are you? +++$+++ 2000s
That's not the reason. I've got a date at six thirty. +++$+++ 1990s
Thanks, Kitty, I'll never forget you for th-- +++$+++ 2000s
I hope you're not comparing yourself to Napoleon. He was a strategist. Your idea of strategy is to use a lead pipe. +++$+++ 1930s
What are we going to say? +++$+++ 1990s
Wait a minute. Do you mean... don't tell me you... in front of him. +++$+++ 1980s
No! +++$+++ 2000s
Just getting my facts straight. Twenty-two makes it a gas chamber bounce. You should have pulled this caper a couple of years ago.  Get life, do a little Youth Authority jolt, transfer to Folsom a big man. Orbit on some of that good prison brew, get yourself a sissy -- +++$+++ 1990s
I won't be needing these anymore. +++$+++ 1980s
I don't know. I was just thinking the same thing. +++$+++ 1990s
I don't think so, sir. +++$+++ 1960s
And you think the movie business is any different? +++$+++ 1990s
Where did you learn to fight like that? JIM  I read a book. +++$+++ 2000s
We've got to get Cathy. +++$+++ 1960s
Yes, of course you remember it, but what you are remembering is merely a series of electrical impulses which you now realize have no necessary connection with outside reality. +++$+++ 1970s
Yessir. I understand that. +++$+++ 2000s
Chili Palmer showed you my script? +++$+++ 1990s
Caesar, you just killed Gino Marzzone. +++$+++ 1990s
Set down sixty meters this side of the telemetry mast.  Immediate dust off on my 'clear,' then stay on station. +++$+++ 1980s
Fourteen, Harry. +++$+++ 1990s
Just trying to get my apartment in order. +++$+++ 1980s
What are we doing here? +++$+++ 1970s
OK, I bite. What does it look like? +++$+++ 1970s
No way we can outrun 'em together. Move it! +++$+++ 1990s
It may be extraterrestrial. +++$+++ 1990s
Yeah, you too, Tracy.  I'm just glad it's over. +++$+++ 1990s
I lie to everybody, what makes you so special? +++$+++ 1990s
Those blood suckers. How I'd love to fix those babies but— +++$+++ 1950s
I think I'll stick around. I'll leave with the porters on their next trip. +++$+++ 1930s
Yeah. Come on—we're stopping here for the night. +++$+++ 1930s
My daddy always said when a man starts talking about the weather keep you hand on your wallet. +++$+++ 2000s
Put you in touch with Grimsrud. +++$+++ 1990s
California. +++$+++ 1990s
That's I.A.'s pit bull. +++$+++ 2000s
Seriously. +++$+++ 2000s
But then I would've missed the pleasure of your company. +++$+++ 1990s
Talk to him. +++$+++ 1980s
No.  I think I said something eloquent like, "So, uh -- maybe we should, ya know.  What do you think?" +++$+++ 1990s
I don't understand.  Do you want my autograph? +++$+++ 1990s
Figlio di puttana. You’re the French asshole who bumped off the London guys... +++$+++ 1990s
What? Who? +++$+++ 1930s
Al! +++$+++ 1990s
Talk? About me--about us? +++$+++ 1930s
Yeah, they hit the calf over the head with a mallet and then Luisa hits it again in the kitchen. +++$+++ 1990s
Alright.  Let me play this record while I go to work on my chicken Parmigiana hero with extra cheese and extra sauce. +++$+++ 1980s
He, I'm Mona. +++$+++ 2000s
See these?  Found them in the box with the cards.  These are stock certificates.  IBM.  AT&T.  Polaroid. +++$+++ 1990s
May I ask where you’re from, Mr Lamont? +++$+++ 1990s
I mean, that's what worried me, 'cause it turns out Nicky was about to be sent to Vegas. +++$+++ 1990s
Hope I'm not interrupting...? +++$+++ 1980s
I told you the questions might get a little personal -- +++$+++ 2000s
I don't want you to think that I'm a drinker. I can stop any time I want to - only I don't want to.  Especially when I'm blue. +++$+++ 1950s
Do you?  Then why don't you go out? Meet someone.  Make a life for yourself instead of hiding away in the past? +++$+++ 1990s
What? +++$+++ 2000s
No, I can't.  I'm sorry and all, but... +++$+++ 1990s
It's not the kind of thing you do. +++$+++ 1990s
I don't know. +++$+++ 2000s
Jim, don't.  You're scaring him. +++$+++ 1990s
I had him! +++$+++ 2000s
Wendy! +++$+++ 1990s
Susie, I want to help you--, there's nothing I won't do for you. You're all I've got in the whole, wide world. +++$+++ 1950s
Hey!  What are you trying to do?  Get yourself committed? +++$+++ 1980s
No way. +++$+++ 1990s
Look on it like a honeymoon. +++$+++ 1990s
You knew them?  Who were they, Sister? Who are these boys? What are the names of these -- good boys you knew? +++$+++ 1990s
Damned hunters.  It was a trap, and you were the bait! +++$+++ 1980s
Yeah!  YEAH!!!  Man I'm getting so HOT!!! +++$+++ 1990s
You did well... +++$+++ 2000s
What happened to me? +++$+++ 1990s
We'll never find the Baron's castle. +++$+++ 1980s
Well ... what's the matter with that? +++$+++ 1960s
He's a house-afire! +++$+++ 1930s
Mrs. Brigman, you're becoming a serious impediment to this mission.  I believe the stress is affecting you.  Escort her to quarters and have Monk prepare a tranquilizer. +++$+++ 1980s
It's her home! It's where she lives!! +++$+++ 1990s
Don't you feel that is a simplistic retort? +++$+++ 2000s
Oh! I'll pop them in a bowl. +++$+++ 1990s
Jesus Christ, Sid! Is everything your responsibility? +++$+++ 1980s
Who the fuck are you? +++$+++ 2000s
One more. Smile. One more. +++$+++ 2000s
Oh, do you? +++$+++ 2000s
Oh, we didn't build it.  The transit system has been in place for billions of years; we're just its... caretakers. +++$+++ 1990s
That only proves my point more. The word is a badge for her failures at school. +++$+++ 1980s
My instinct was to not get electrocuted. +++$+++ 1990s
The good stuff.  Can you handle that? +++$+++ 2000s
Sorry.  It's just...a strange woman waltzes into my office today.  Tells me she murdered her parents and can prove Satan exists. +++$+++ 2000s
I got it. +++$+++ 1990s
Well, Mister President. +++$+++ 1960s
I have a pretty good idea. Ordell ain't no bootlegger and I doubt he's smugglin' Cuban cigars. So that only leaves one thing an A.T.F. man would be interested in. +++$+++ 1990s
All right, Major.  I'm putting the base on condition Red. +++$+++ 1960s
Little girl. Maybe five years old? +++$+++ 1990s
A small thing.  Nothing really. +++$+++ 2000s
Yessir. +++$+++ 2000s
If she does it'll be a miracle outa Scripture. +++$+++ 1940s
What does that fucking mean? +++$+++ 1990s
Oh, right.  Alright. +++$+++ 2000s
I'm here about some monkeys. +++$+++ 1990s
He ain't dead? You didn't get him? +++$+++ 1990s
Okay, billion...right, of course. They told me I could have any producer I wanted -- and I want you. +++$+++ 1980s
I’m compulsive and weird? +++$+++ 2000s
I couldn't see much in the dark - but it was one! +++$+++ 1950s
What's this? +++$+++ 1990s
I've got some more clothes for you-- I just keep forgetting to bring them with me. +++$+++ 1990s
We're going down into the sewer system to see if we can trace the source of the psycho-reactive slime flow.  We thought you might want to come along. +++$+++ 1980s
He's not that old yet.  You've lost confidence in me. +++$+++ 1990s
When he was about seventeen, he startin' losin' his hair. +++$+++ 1990s
May I use your telephone? +++$+++ 1930s
I feel...isolated.  Different.  I've got abandonment issues.  My father flew away when I was just a larva. My mother didn't have much time for me...when you have five million siblings, it's difficult to get attention.  I feel physically inadequate -- I've never been able to lift more than ten times my own weight.  Sometimes I think I'm just not cut out to be a worker.  But I don't have any other options.  I was assigned to trade school when I was just a <u>grub</u>.  The whole system just...makes me feel...<u>insignificant</u>. +++$+++ 1990s
You were screaming like crazy. +++$+++ 1980s
Why didn't she put'em out? +++$+++ 2000s
Guard barracks.  Take some shots. +++$+++ 1980s
He strained his leg so that it pains him to ride. But he sends his greetings -- and says that I speak for all the Bruces. And for Scotland. +++$+++ 1990s
My Aunt Bella, sweet woman not the brightest bat in the world - she used to hang right side up, anyway she always said "Curses were made to be broken". Course, she said it in those irritating little bat squeaks, so it wasn't quite so profound... +++$+++ 1990s
Got to talk to the brothers. +++$+++ 1950s
That's not the purpose of this mission.  Captain -- keep a straight course -- until you're in the clear. +++$+++ 1960s
I did you a favor by standing up for you last night, but don't think we're friends. I'm sorry, but I have other things - +++$+++ 1990s
C'mon, Beth.  Don't make this personal.  He told me himself they were taking us back. +++$+++ 1990s
With all due respect, Your Honor... We don't live in this courtroom, do we? +++$+++ 1990s
No -- she asked me about cocaine. +++$+++ 1990s
You certainly do. +++$+++ 1990s
He's not strong enough to fight off another attack. +++$+++ 2000s
You've got a big mouth, and now I'm going to show you an even bigger one. +++$+++ 1990s
Oh.  That was just one of those idle questions.  One doesn't expect an answer. +++$+++ 1990s
I'll tell you what, Barbara.  I don't think we survived that crash. +++$+++ 1980s
No, the Mediocre Mantini. Of course the Great Mantini! +++$+++ 1990s
Well, we was. Like you said, I changed my mind an'... +++$+++ 1990s
Huh huh huh. That was cool. +++$+++ 1990s
You think I'm staying? +++$+++ 1990s
To Mexico... +++$+++ 1970s
I don't think I'll persuade you. You'll do it or you won't. Dr. Bloom is working an it anyway, and he's the best... +++$+++ 1980s
That's not ENTIRELY true. +++$+++ 2000s
Soggy Bottom Boys - I don't precisely recollect, uh - +++$+++ 2000s
Thou. For Thou art with me.  Welcome, welcome, welcome! +++$+++ 1970s
I think by Twenty-two. +++$+++ 2000s
Okay. +++$+++ 2000s
Yeah. Something slippery all over here...  Tina? +++$+++ 1980s
Get it while you're young.  And you better fix your lips.  You want to look nice for Osgood, don't you? +++$+++ 1950s
Really. You want to dance with someone else? +++$+++ 1980s
Jean? Sorbet? +++$+++ 2000s
Garry's missing! +++$+++ 1980s
C'mon. +++$+++ 1990s
And? +++$+++ 1980s
I dare you. Stab my flesh. Which one of us will bleed? +++$+++ 2000s
You want me to walk you? +++$+++ 1980s
Aw, come on Jerry. We've gotten all we're gonna get out of this place and its starting to rain. +++$+++ 2000s
See and raise five. +++$+++ 1970s
You are being typically theatrical, Marion. I need the Tribune to-- +++$+++ 1990s
Well, wait and see. +++$+++ 1940s
What did he look like? +++$+++ 2000s
What'd it say? +++$+++ 1980s
I will not do it.  You'll have to get somebody else, because I will not. +++$+++ 1990s
Fine. Mrs. Buckley will be all right when she gets used to the idea. +++$+++ 1980s
Chloe? +++$+++ 2000s
Guess who? +++$+++ 1980s
Only that floor. +++$+++ 1990s
The core could be hardwired to overload without much effort. +++$+++ 1990s
What if he asks where I got the money? +++$+++ 1980s
You think he'll find us. +++$+++ 1980s
I heard the same sound at Ladysmith, at Nukden, Port Arthur.  What do you expect after a battle? +++$+++ 1940s
It's okay.  Edward told me.  Your secret's safe with me. +++$+++ 1990s
Your father loved me.  He wanted to marry me. But he was afraid of hurting the gentle, delicate Cathy. You spoiled his life ——you've ruined mine —— +++$+++ 1940s
Get up from there. I don't want anybody holding the ends of my pants. Get up from there! +++$+++ 1930s
Justin just tried to kill himself. The man is clearly insane. +++$+++ 1990s
What're we looking for? +++$+++ 2000s
On your piano, that is the swap. +++$+++ 1990s
Alright Willie, I think I got everything. I'll talk to Dillard, see if I can get up to the infirmary and check up on you. Make sure they're changing your diapers regular. +++$+++ 2000s
You're not joking. +++$+++ 2000s
You're very protective of him, Randal. You always have been. +++$+++ 1990s
I still don't get why you're trying to break into the system. +++$+++ 1980s
Dear Veronica, Heather was your soulmate.....Share. +++$+++ 1980s
No!  The only hope now is to get him back here.  If I can just find a way to relieve the pressure on his cerebellum... +++$+++ 1970s
What are you doing? +++$+++ 2000s
They'll mend. +++$+++ 1980s
I know you miss your parents, its hasn't been that long. +++$+++ 1980s
Can you believe she fuckin' bit me? +++$+++ 1980s
You'll never do it! You can't do it! +++$+++ 1930s
Alright. All right, all right, so whatta you wanna do? +++$+++ 1970s
I'm thinking that if the black Book Of The Dead can bring people back to life -- +++$+++ 1990s
Yeah, ya should've come along with us, Miss Ratched, an' gotten a little sun on your cheeks and maybe caught a fish or two. +++$+++ 1970s
My name is Lorl, sir. I'm a maidservant. I was asked to come here and offer my services to you. +++$+++ 1980s
Look, even if it was nearer, that's just not what I do. I give clinics. And I'm not even doing them for a while. I'm heading back to Montana right now. I got a ranch to take care of... +++$+++ 1990s
I think we should get something straight here. I was assigned to this office by the city. +++$+++ 1990s
What is so incredibly great about New York? It's a dying city! You-you read "Death in Venice". +++$+++ 1970s
Of course. Sorry. I'm such a fucking asshole. +++$+++ 2000s
No -- I'm afraid not. +++$+++ 2000s
So you're still on the Zoloft? +++$+++ 2000s
+ The nose is sharper. Smaller too.                          +  &lt;&lt;And what about the hair? You said something earlier about it.&gt;&gt; +++$+++ 1990s

Someone named Hockley, I should imagine. +++$+++ 1990s
Not really. +++$+++ 1990s
Why do you think he does that, Gerry? +++$+++ 1990s
What? +++$+++ 1980s
What'd you do? +++$+++ 1990s
He means the last that we know of. +++$+++ 1980s
I hope so. +++$+++ 2000s
Let's just say he burned me once. +++$+++ 2000s
Just one year. +++$+++ 1980s

Look, I can't run your arrest in CNN, but I guarantee he's monitoring every law enforcement agency in the world, for what they might be saying about him, if nothing else - he's got the ability and, we assume, the desire to get you out of there. +++$+++ 2000s
Remember when I went to Italy and canceled the policy on the new stadium.  Well, we weren't being cheated by the Mafia or anybody except maybe by me...  ... Do they come for lunch everyday? I really went on my own business, to see a man that I happen to be in love with... and I'm glad I did it, but I'm sorry about the policy and I'll be happy to make up the money the company didn't get... of course just now I don't have...  One million, four hundred and ten thousand dollars.

Have to hope it's a signal that he'll back down on the real issue too. +++$+++ 2000s

What teacher? +++$+++ 1950s
Don't you think I stand out like this. +++$+++ 1980s
Lieutenant Doolittle, this is Talby. Lieutenant? +++$+++ 1970s
That thing about I was the most, you know, beautiful person you had ever known.  What was that? +++$+++ 2000s
Imposserous! +++$+++ 1930s
Yes, I think so. He adores her, it's almost pitiful the way he worships her. I just hope she isn't too much for him. +++$+++ 1990s
