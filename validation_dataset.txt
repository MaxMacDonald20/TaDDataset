Either way, maybe there's a book in it, and they both make a ton of money. +++$+++ 2000s
You must know your third grade geography book inside out. +++$+++ 1960s
You are going to drive to the frontier. +++$+++ 1970s
I've already got a team there. I doubt Bourne's in Naples to settle down and raise a family. +++$+++ 2000s
Give it to me! +++$+++ 1990s
I got released. +++$+++ 1980s
What a creep. +++$+++ 1990s
Daddy wouldn't hear that. Now the redhaired boy you see sitting there, of course you have met him, he is my oldest son and my most brilliant child. All children have great creative powers, but I don't want to rattle on about my children, they say I brag too much about them, especially about Brother. Am I boring you, Rose? +++$+++ 1990s
Yeah. +++$+++ 1930s
The man following me has a walkie- talkie. If he sees I'm not here he'll call his partner. I do anything out of line and he'll send the word to kill my daughter. +++$+++ 1990s
Alex. +++$+++ 1970s
Why? +++$+++ 1950s
Could we have a word? +++$+++ 1990s
But, but but but... +++$+++ 2000s
Something. Someone. +++$+++ 2000s
So why did you come back here, Sam? +++$+++ 1990s
Fernando wasn't pissed off at everybody. He just wanted to fix their cars. +++$+++ 1990s
I'm out! I'm out! +++$+++ 1930s
Goose is dead. +++$+++ 1980s
Pride of a job-well-done... +++$+++ 1990s
You haven't heard from him, have you, Dad? +++$+++ 1930s
My dress'll reek. +++$+++ 1990s
Your daddy's still livin' down there from what you told me.  I guess he wouldn't help you any, would he? I wasn't thinking. You don't know anybody? +++$+++ 1990s
Right. CHINA I need a taking care of,  not `hey how bout a pizza after class babe'.  I'm looking  for something just a little more in a man.  A little `je nes se qua'. +++$+++ 1980s
Well, it's rather interesting about Brother, actually. I realized the remarkable thing he had when he was six weeks old. He looked at me and understood me, he knew exactly who I was. I know it sounds crazy but it's true. He's very remarkable, he was born for the ministry and could move millions, but he doesn't know that yet. I have to warn you about him, he can be very dangerous, there is an evil streak in him, a streak of pure sheer meanness. But at heart Brother is saintly and that is why he was born for the ministry even if he doesn't know it. +++$+++ 1990s
Oh. No. Strictly dryland. +++$+++ 1980s
Eh! Love...what a mystery!  I understand you, Toto...The ones with blue eyes are the most beautiful. Whatever you do, you can't make friends with them.  Eh, there's nothing to be done about it! The heavier a man is, the deeper his footprints. And if he's in love, he suffers, because he knows he's up a one-way street. Because love is a meaningless thing when a man gets it into his head to do what he wants... +++$+++ 1980s
Even if money wasn't an issue, Dunwitty will still go ahead without me and that could be more dangerous. +++$+++ 2000s
I don't know -- how would I know? +++$+++ 1960s
Do you like it? +++$+++ 2000s
More, do you hear me? +++$+++ 1970s
Sure, sure, we'd all be millionaires. There's no point in looking back. At the time, Stilson thought dumping our position would panic the market, further depress the stock -- then we'd buy it all back, and more of course, once it got cheap -- +++$+++ 1990s
Where did you learn that word? +++$+++ 2000s
Is that an innuendo, Miss Teschmacher? Because if it is, you are about to experience the heady thrill of being hurled from a moving vehicle. +++$+++ 1970s
Yeah. What's wrong with you guys? Think ahead. We find 'em, sue 'em. We'll make a killing.  We'll have dinner at Chasen's twice a week, we'll be pissing on ice the rest of our lives. +++$+++ 1970s
Why would they do all that if we weren't? +++$+++ 1990s
Yeah, sure... +++$+++ 2000s
And why should continuing excellence cost more? +++$+++ 2000s
Need to lose some weight. +++$+++ 2000s
What'd you guys find? +++$+++ 2000s
Edward T. Dowd. +++$+++ 1980s
Hurry up with those drinks. We're thirsty. Only two rums. Make mine a Bloody Mary. +++$+++ 1990s
I was afraid of that. +++$+++ 1980s
Well you're not reading it right! +++$+++ 1980s
Mikey-- +++$+++ 1990s
There is some good in you, Lex, after all. +++$+++ 1980s
Good evening. I want to stay at this hotel. +++$+++ 1990s
I hope you have patience with me.  I do not know how to dance the quadrille but, if you desire it, I will learn. +++$+++ 1990s
Well forgive me if I don't think of you as the world's safest bet. +++$+++ 2000s
How would you describe him? +++$+++ 2000s
Yes sir. +++$+++ 1960s
I'm stuck here for another couple of hours. +++$+++ 2000s
He was murdered. +++$+++ 1990s
You got a good lawyer? +++$+++ 1990s
Sometimes I think he is fooling us with that crazy business. +++$+++ 1950s
A million deaths are not enough for Yueh... +++$+++ 1980s
Victoria - +++$+++ 1980s
How good is he? +++$+++ 1960s
Hi. +++$+++ 1980s
I can't believe the Captain went along with a memory download. +++$+++ 2000s
Well then, perhaps you also --- +++$+++ 1940s
Okay, whatta I do? +++$+++ 1990s
That doesn't mean you do. You can't possibly trust him, he's... perverted. +++$+++ 1980s
Nice job. +++$+++ 1990s
Go ahead and put the guard back up, Letty. But you need to know what you're dealing with. +++$+++ 2000s
Why? +++$+++ 1950s
Just don't know why I'd be doing it. +++$+++ 1990s
I like football. +++$+++ 1990s
Eve. I - I don't think you meant to cause unhappiness. But you did. More to yourself, perhaps - as it turned out - than to anyone else... +++$+++ 1950s
You should give it to someone with only one leg. +++$+++ 1990s
I think a skin cell’s the more likely of the two. +++$+++ 2000s
I thought Blockbuster fired you. +++$+++ 1990s
No -- leave it -- +++$+++ 1970s
It's all right, Captain.  Proceed. +++$+++ 1980s
I admit it. +++$+++ 1950s
I don't know that Ellie.  He might get out.  Garber's not bein' straight with the witness, she could be in deep shit if she identifies him, and it's my job to convince her she won't be. +++$+++ 1980s
There you are, both of you. Max, Karen has decided it's time to go. +++$+++ 1950s
Boy! +++$+++ 1970s
Aren't you coming back with me? +++$+++ 1970s
I'm sure you'll figure it out. +++$+++ 2000s
Hello, Mr. Leland. +++$+++ 1940s
I got a surprise for you, blondie... +++$+++ 1990s
Mmm. +++$+++ 1990s
I couldn't care less. +++$+++ 1990s
And Jewish men like to get it. +++$+++ 2000s
Don't go playing policeman. +++$+++ 1990s
Donna? +++$+++ 1980s
I must have missed 60 Minutes.  What are you saying? +++$+++ 1980s
Only family allowed, Nancy. You know the drill. +++$+++ 1980s
And what in blazes have the nuns got to do with it? +++$+++ 1950s
Nigger, fuck me hard!!... +++$+++ 2000s
Him no white.  Him no white. +++$+++ 1980s
A little... +++$+++ 1990s
Every time I see something like that, I know we're right to be here- to bring Christianity into their lives, enrich their souls. +++$+++ 1990s
Now Edna says you short-changed your last meds.  You can do presents and be comfortable at the same time, y'know. +++$+++ 1990s
She was with you after she left Frank. +++$+++ 1970s
Well, he certainly isn't acting like it. +++$+++ 1990s
Shouldn't we pay 'em for the damages? +++$+++ 1970s
That's crazy. I'll get you some applications. +++$+++ 1990s
No, no, no: he has yet to achieve mediocrity. +++$+++ 1980s
You've been on your feet for days. And didn't even finish your salad. +++$+++ 1990s
Save it for the powder room babe, this man is in pain +++$+++ 1980s
Where'd they go? +++$+++ 1990s
What I know is that as long as you keep your work zipped up around me, I don't give a fuck what or where you shove your show. Are we being neighbors for now? +++$+++ 1990s
There was ninety-one million - +++$+++ 1990s
Sorry.  If I did, I didn't mean to. +++$+++ 1990s
--I want you to shut up and listen to me-- +++$+++ 1970s
Tell me, damn you. +++$+++ 1980s
I'll get my jacket. +++$+++ 1990s
Who told you to think?!  I don't give you enough information to think!  You do what you're told!!  That's what you do! +++$+++ 1990s
For heaven's sake, Joe—stop being an editor for just a minute.  We've been friends for a long time, haven't we? You ought to know when I'm serious. This is on the level. +++$+++ 1930s
They're <u>somebody's</u> friends...  You drive a cab.  I kill people.  We both do our jobs right, you might survive the night and come out four hundred bucks ahead. +++$+++ 2000s

Mr. Thatcher is going to take you on a trip with him tonight, Charles. You'll be leaving on Number Ten. +++$+++ 1940s
No. +++$+++ 1990s
Chase, you'd better come home. +++$+++ 1990s
... Y'know Al, if Hoover was alive none of this would've happened.  He would've protected the President. +++$+++ 1990s
The poor thing.... +++$+++ 1950s
Isn't he the one that always writes about things - only the things he knows about? +++$+++ 1930s
No, you have a press agent do it. +++$+++ 1970s
Well, what'ya do? +++$+++ 1990s
You would be, two, if you'd gone through what he went through. +++$+++ 1990s
Oh brother. Here we go. +++$+++ 2000s
Oh, it'll do in a pinch. +++$+++ 1930s
What are you doing? +++$+++ 2000s
And then they're gonna stamp on it?! +++$+++ 1990s
Not bad...? This guy's Dr. Kildare, the jury's going to love him, Mick... And you calm down, all right? Their guy, Towler's, the author of the book,  'Methodology and Practice, Anesthesiology.'  ...and they got depositions from the nurses, everybody in the operating room, the scrub-nurse... 'All these guys are God. I saw them walk on water...'  They had an obstetrical nurse in there. We got a deposition from the obstetrical nurse? +++$+++ 1980s
Honest, Toby.  I just axed him for a quarter for the jukebox. +++$+++ 1990s
I told you not to hang up on me. +++$+++ 1990s
You really love me, don't you? +++$+++ 1980s
Unless we set Charenton on a straight and narrow course, she'll be shut down forever by order of the Emperor. +++$+++ 2000s
Did you tell them that I flooded the school? +++$+++ 2000s
What do you remember about her. +++$+++ 1990s
Evone tells me:  I shoulda been in, fi, six, months ago.... thizz my first checkup. +++$+++ 2000s
Yet you look so sad. A great man like you should not be sad. +++$+++ 2000s
You're a snake. +++$+++ 1990s
Thank you. +++$+++ 2000s
Everyone is going to the dance. Aren't you ? +++$+++ 1990s
Perhaps the General's glasses can reach to the Hudson and he knows the size and imminence of the army of Webb...? +++$+++ 1970s
Oh, what do they know? +++$+++ 1980s
I know. It's the house you want to wake up in on Christmas morning.  Make yourself at home. I'll be right back. +++$+++ 2000s
Hungry, anyway. +++$+++ 1990s
So, you called me up, because you just wanted to have a drink before you... go find a hotel? +++$+++ 1990s
If my kids and my wife were always at an ex-husband's house, I'd worry. +++$+++ 2000s
Thanks, I see him... +++$+++ 1950s
Who's going to fly our helicopter now? +++$+++ 1970s
Hey, mister. +++$+++ 1960s
Ow, let go, Butt-Head! +++$+++ 1990s
We had a chance...We could have stopped them!  The mob stole the trucks and smashed everything up.  The fools!  They cut their own throats! +++$+++ 1950s
Why, so you can go after him? +++$+++ 1980s
Long live the fighters! +++$+++ 1980s
All right. +++$+++ 1990s
To conceal a small break in the surface of the sphere. +++$+++ 1990s
Good night. +++$+++ 1950s
You can almost spit on it, can't you? +++$+++ 1930s
How much longer's that gonna take? +++$+++ 2000s
You figger Scar means to kill us? +++$+++ 1950s
That's all right. +++$+++ 1940s
Everyone's saying he's . . . dead. But I know that isn't true. I feel it in my heart. I think he just needs help. +++$+++ 1980s
I'm not sick. +++$+++ 1980s
Yes yes, I did get my degree up there. +++$+++ 1990s
Are you? +++$+++ 1980s
I just think Ricky would rather not get a bowling lesson in front of the other kids. +++$+++ 1980s
Tony. I'm sorry if things didn't work out so well for you tonight. With Terry. +++$+++ 2000s
Not according to Mrs. Rabinow. +++$+++ 2000s
Security. +++$+++ 1950s
You have no reason to feel ashamed. You haven't said anything you don't have a right to. And if anybody tells you different -- you just send them to me. +++$+++ 1990s
Now what else? DAVID I don't know. +++$+++ 1990s
All right, jesus. +++$+++ 1980s
You're not the Shipping Greenleaf's? +++$+++ 1990s
Probably another rebel patrol. They operate in here all the time. +++$+++ 1980s
What? +++$+++ 1980s
Jasmine has this thing for dolphins. I had them make it... +++$+++ 1990s
Yes.  Isn't that amazing? +++$+++ 1990s
Now look, here's something that really has a heart. This is the best invention I ever invented. +++$+++ 1930s
Shrimp and fries. +++$+++ 1990s
Jimmy, is it? Do you know me, Jimmy? +++$+++ 1990s
Give me it. +++$+++ 2000s
Why? +++$+++ 1990s
Nobody leaves. +++$+++ 2000s
We have to get off this ship!! +++$+++ 1980s
Nah, it's phony baloney -- I faked the whole thing.  It didn't hurt at all.  It was just a yoga move.  I tucked my head in. +++$+++ 1990s
Okay, O'Neil.  So you've impressed all the others.  Now try me. +++$+++ 1990s
There! You see? He admits it! You're a fake, John Doe! And for what you've done to all these good people—they ought to run you out of the country—and I hope they do it! +++$+++ 1940s
Spontaneously combust? +++$+++ 2000s
Oh well he sure did a beautiful job. Pink and gold are my favorite colors. +++$+++ 1980s
Did she leave any records here? Tax or business records? Maybe a list of employees? +++$+++ 1990s
Where’s my real dad? +++$+++ 2000s
Bill Mayhew! Some help! The guy's a souse! +++$+++ 1990s
After my wife died, I felt like a fifth wheel. You know, so many years being with one person -- a very wonderful person -- makes you always think of yourself as part of a pair...When Ethel passed away, I was lost. I couldn't function socially and I couldn't function in business. +++$+++ 1980s
It's going back down. +++$+++ 1990s
In the abstract maybe. Get a grip on yourself! But when I imagine you going out with other guys, I feel... ah... +++$+++ 1980s
What do you mean, "possessed?" +++$+++ 2000s
Well, he's still running the show, ain't he, Dad? +++$+++ 1930s
Track with me, here...  They knew the "Russians" were undercover Feeb?  They should have no-showed.  But, no, these guys show anyway, and commit murder upon federal officers.  And steal all your money...  What does that say to you? +++$+++ 2000s
They are useless! It was Kirk I needed. And I let him slip away. +++$+++ 1980s
It's over twenty miles to the crossroads. Steve'll be back in an hour. Things will straighten out then. We'll take his Jeep and get help. +++$+++ 2000s
Yeah, that's clerical. +++$+++ 1980s
You tried to fuck me in my father's office, you sick bastard. Look, Vic, whatever you wanna do in the privacy of your own home, go do it. But don't try to fuck me. I don't think of you that way. I mean, I like you a lot - +++$+++ 1990s
Promise me again... +++$+++ 2000s
I've got to make a stop in Vegas, then I'm heading to Santa Barbara. +++$+++ 1970s
I have feelings for you. +++$+++ 1990s
Interesting business. +++$+++ 1950s
That actually goes on... +++$+++ 1980s
I knew you must have. No one stops here anymore unless they do. +++$+++ 1960s
For godsakes, Jim, slow down and stop acting like the little dutch boy.  Not even you can plug all the world's leaks.  Don't you think it's a sign you're pushing too hard when your daughter sees more of you on MTV news than in person. +++$+++ 1990s
Don't take it to heart, Betsy. +++$+++ 1940s
I need the money to smooth my way, you understand? Now, have you got that sort of cash here or do we need to meet in the morning? +++$+++ 1990s
And he is living proof. +++$+++ 1990s
I tell you - this is the only way to travel. +++$+++ 1950s
I feel like we've barely spent any time together since we got here. +++$+++ 2000s
Don't tell me it's not the gas! +++$+++ 1980s
Are you all right? +++$+++ 2000s
Oh, yeah.  "The Philosophy of Time Travel". What is this? +++$+++ 2000s
I want to fuck. +++$+++ 1990s
Do you want me to say I did it? +++$+++ 2000s
What? +++$+++ 1990s
Unn. +++$+++ 2000s
You don't give us our due credit.  Our scientists have done things no one could ever do before. +++$+++ 1990s
Picking up velocity. +++$+++ 1990s
No you're not. Jack Lint is a lesson to you - he never had your brains but he's got the ambition. You haven't got the ambition but luckily you've got me. And Mr Helpmann. Mr Helpmann was very close - +++$+++ 1980s
You're shaking. +++$+++ 1980s
Have communications contact all interface centers.  Tell them due to high demand, we're at full capacity and so temporarily there's no room for anyone else on the system. +++$+++ 1920s
Good morning, Mr. President. +++$+++ 1970s
I ran into some people I knew. +++$+++ 1950s
They can't because neither knows if the other is a deranged senseless killer like the Knoxs. So, you may as well make the first move. +++$+++ 1990s
I ain't givin' you fuckin' excuses, I'm givin' you reasons. +++$+++ 1990s
I like to think that I'm a pretty astute observer of the human scene. +++$+++ 2000s
Freaked me out so bad I hid in a shopping cart for four hours. 'Course, missed the show... +++$+++ 2000s
I do spy a kind of hope, Which craves as desperate and execution as that is desperate which we would prevent. If, rather than to marry Paris, Thou hast the strength of will to slay thyself, Then it is likely thou wilt undertake a thing like death, to chide away this shame. No warmth, no breath shall testify thou livest . Each part, deprived of supple government, shall stiff and stark and cold appear, like death. Now when the bridegroom in the morning comes to rouse thee from thy bed, there art thou dead. Thou shalt be borne to that same ancient vault where all he kindred to the Capulet lie. In the meantime, against thou shalt awake, shall Romeo by my letters know our drift, and hither shall he come. And that very night shall Romeo bear thee hence to Mantua. Take thou this vial, being then in bed, and this distilling liquor drink thou off. I'll send my letters to thy lord post haste to Mantua. +++$+++ 1960s
But what? +++$+++ 1990s
I'm lost, boss.  What are we saying here? +++$+++ 1990s
The tide's running.  It'll take us to the light. +++$+++ 1970s
Somebody told her. +++$+++ 1980s
What is it? +++$+++ 1990s
Three days? I must be. +++$+++ 1990s
I'm an electrician, not a wet nurse, y'know. +++$+++ 1960s
Forget it. +++$+++ 1980s
Away put your weapon.  I mean you no harm. +++$+++ 1980s
Yes. And I've accepted. +++$+++ 1990s
I can't take him to work. +++$+++ 2000s
Six people mutilated? It had to be me, Alex. +++$+++ 1980s
I'd like to, very much -- but it depends on what dispatches are waiting for me on the mainland. +++$+++ 1940s
A massive cardiac arrest. +++$+++ 1990s
Yeah. What about the time we hid the missing heiress in the sauerkraut factory? Six scoop interviews! +++$+++ 1940s
What happened?  What's Earl doing here? +++$+++ 1990s
Our next D.A. -- I hear Bruce Wayne is throwing a fundraiser.  Did you get your invitation yet? +++$+++ 1980s
...And now you're making fun of me? I'm warning you! If you don't take me after all these years of sacrifice, I'll never forgive you!! +++$+++ 1990s
Yeah. Like the kid on your beach. I wish I could've examined that shark they caught... +++$+++ 1970s
Let's drive by where we're meeting and have a look.  Maybe take a look at Ripley's place while we're at it. +++$+++ 1990s
But he never writes, speaks, or does any propaganda for the Russians.  He meets Marina, whose uncle is a colonel in Soviet intelligence, at a trade union dance; she thinks he's Russian the way he speaks, six weeks later they marry, have a daughter. +++$+++ 1990s
...They been fuckin' 'em, 'an tellin' every bow-legged one of 'em how they're payin' a thousand dollars to whatever sonofabitch kills them two boys which cut up Delilah. +++$+++ 1990s
Be careful. +++$+++ 1990s
He didn't mention a park. +++$+++ 1990s
We were trying to scare your mother. +++$+++ 1980s
No, I'm not saying her. I'm just saying, I don't know. +++$+++ 1990s
We got the press this time! +++$+++ 1990s
Captain says to wait 'til the Patrol gits here. +++$+++ 1960s
Yeah? +++$+++ 2000s
You ever read Meister Eckart?  How did you ever get your Doctorate without reading Eckart?  Good. Okay, let's turn over gently. Right side. +++$+++ 1990s
If I die, then they'll be free. It's getting late, isn't it? I can tell, it's a cold feeling when it's late. It's warm then it gets cold. Jeffrey. I feel it getting cold. +++$+++ 1980s
I didn't frisk him. He must have dropped it in Burns' office. I didn't know whose it was. +++$+++ 1940s
Operator, what's today's date? +++$+++ 1980s
No, I think I will, it's safer. I have patience. +++$+++ 1990s
He must be behind that curtain. Relax. We're undercover. We need to give off the appearance of calm. You see Esther, the trick to undercover work is to try and blend in. Act as a Gentile would. +++$+++ 2000s
What? +++$+++ 2000s
Rennie, you're the best student I ever had...you have a real gift. If anybody can make use of that pen, it's you. +++$+++ 1980s
Locked. +++$+++ 1980s
You have her cell number? +++$+++ 2000s
I'm gonna stay here in this room, Sailor. I don't feel so good? This heat makes me tired. +++$+++ 1990s
Nobody's got clean kids. +++$+++ 1990s
You all watch your step.  We got some burrows goin' down seven stories here.  You fall, I don't wanna have to come pick you up. +++$+++ 1990s
You mean -- worried about my testimony? +++$+++ 1990s
Marty, do you see your suspect? +++$+++ 1980s
Just a friend. +++$+++ 2000s
I suppose. +++$+++ 1980s
You think you could make an exception just this once, boss? She came all the way down from New York. +++$+++ 2000s
I'm working with one of the victims outta Brooklyn North.  You mind I take a shot at him? +++$+++ 2000s
So far so good. +++$+++ 1980s
Yes.  We're men.  Men is what we are. +++$+++ 1990s
Jesus. Any word from Brent? +++$+++ 2000s
That's right Mike. But he's finished and came back around three ot four months ago, He's in Woodstock now. +++$+++ 1970s
Yes. I'd never been in a place like that before. +++$+++ 2000s
And what about you? Did you kill Brumby? +++$+++ 2000s
Right. +++$+++ 1980s
Jesus. We've been at this for six months. +++$+++ 1990s
Then, we will begin with replacing the Tibetan flag with the flag of the Motherland. +++$+++ 1990s
Thanks for your help, Peck. +++$+++ 1980s
I'll have the bell-hop take care of your luggage. +++$+++ 1950s
Puff, put the gun down. +++$+++ 2000s
Hildy, you think I could? After this story?  Here! You're just nervous. +++$+++ 1940s
Oh, listen to teacher's pet. +++$+++ 1960s
I know. +++$+++ 2000s
To celebrate how masterfully you destroyed Roston today. +++$+++ 1990s
These machines -- They're in here. +++$+++ 1990s
Can I come into bed with you for a little while, I feel terrible. +++$+++ 1980s
You don't sound like you're from here. +++$+++ 2000s
It's empty.  Why would someone build a ship like this? +++$+++ 1990s
He used that? +++$+++ 2000s
Oh, no! +++$+++ 1980s
I seem to recognize this routine. First the kiss then the touch.  Oh, what's the use. You're you. +++$+++ 1990s
The Hilton. +++$+++ 1970s
GET OFF ME! +++$+++ 1990s
...It's just that you've been there. Your advice really helps. +++$+++ 1990s
Two weeks holiday. +++$+++ 2000s
You don't have to run with me, Crease. +++$+++ 1980s
This place, the one across the street, four other ones around Ciudad Leon-- soy el Rey de las Llantas. King of the Tires. Lots of your people rollin' back over that bridge on my rubber. +++$+++ 1990s
I think your condescension is even better. +++$+++ 2000s
Does it hurt? +++$+++ 2000s
I'd say we're about even. +++$+++ 1990s
Yeah, well, what are you gonna do?  You and me, Pablo?  Are we good? +++$+++ 2000s
He's twenty-four now? A year older than you? And must be 'bout bald. +++$+++ 1990s
Only he wasn't carryin' no pistol this time. +++$+++ 1990s
Well, it's nice to know you think we're clever. +++$+++ 1960s
That's swell. But how about here?  Ever worked for Robert Knox, Emma Dill, Clarence Speer, Marian Parsons, or Jasper Lamar Crabb? +++$+++ 1970s
Jesus, can't make a buck in this market, country's going to hell faster than when that sonofabitch Roosevelt was around... too much cheap money sloshing around the world. The biggest mistake we ever made was letting Nixon get off the gold standard. Putney Drug--you boys might want to have a look at it. +++$+++ 1980s
They won't tell you anything. +++$+++ 1990s
Jesus, are the questions too tough for you already?  Let's try again--  Is your name Porter? +++$+++ 1980s
How long? +++$+++ 1980s
Teresa. +++$+++ 1980s
No. +++$+++ 1990s
Well? +++$+++ 1990s
What? +++$+++ 2000s
Chocolate. +++$+++ 1980s
It was our dream, too, Buddy, together ... always. +++$+++ 1990s
Oh, Frank, you've got it bad, so much worse than I thought. +++$+++ 1990s
Three days. I was worried about you. How are you feeling? +++$+++ 2000s
What are you? +++$+++ 2000s
If it helps bring her back, be my guest... +++$+++ 2000s
All too easy.  Perhaps you are not as strong as The Emperor thought. +++$+++ 1980s
There weren't any wires. I looked. +++$+++ 1970s
What now? +++$+++ 1980s
Why's it here? +++$+++ 2000s
You are very pretty. I would like to kiss you. +++$+++ 1990s
Leia! +++$+++ 1980s
The first day. +++$+++ 1990s
No, no -- Jenny used to work as a waitress.  Before she met him.  But that's not where she met me.  Not in my restaurant. +++$+++ 1990s
Bring us an ashtray for Mr. KIMBALL, please. She whisks in with a crystal ashtray as they sit in silence. +++$+++ 2000s
They say we must pray to their evil god. We say we will not. +++$+++ 1980s
I don't know. I just -- there are a lot of really confused people showing up at the office. +++$+++ 2000s
Don't be nervous.  They said you'd be nervous. +++$+++ 1990s
No scaredy-cats in the Talamasca, huh...? +++$+++ 1990s
Well, why didn't you bring them? +++$+++ 1990s
Did you give him it? +++$+++ 1990s
Nine hundred meters and dropping. 800.  700.  Hang on gentlemen. +++$+++ 1970s
I must have the breakdown now. Where is Berthier? +++$+++ 1990s
You're like your mother.  You love money. +++$+++ 2000s
Why don't you go back to sleep. I'll go out and buy us some breakfast. +++$+++ 1990s
Where there is spice and spice mining there are always worms. +++$+++ 1980s
So, we'll... +++$+++ 1990s
Yeah. Right around the cheeks and chin. Boy did I have a crush on her. She was the first girl I ever put my tongue in her mouth. +++$+++ 1990s
How did you guess? +++$+++ 2000s
Yeah, we're gonna make a lotta money together, from now on. +++$+++ 1960s
Aye -- that I would, lass. +++$+++ 1990s
Prepare the ship for departure at oh-seven-hundred hours. +++$+++ 1990s
Mary Dawson, huh? Mary Dawson, my eye. That dame took you for a sleigh ride that New York will laugh about for years. She's the slickest, two- timing, double-crossing— +++$+++ 1930s
I've been buzzing you, Mr. Parrish. Are you all right? +++$+++ 1990s
Took it this morning. +++$+++ 1980s
What? +++$+++ 1990s
Hang on...  Remember that Cessna we saw at the pumping station on the Haul Road?  Belongs to the guy they got patrolling the pipeline. +++$+++ 1990s
What if you hide me? +++$+++ 2000s
Am I supposed to feel happy now? +++$+++ 2000s
You've been the man in mine. +++$+++ 1990s
Trust me. +++$+++ 1980s
Xaintrailles...!  Don't talk to me about miracles...  If I was still sitting there waiting for a miracle, I'd be dead now. Anyway... +++$+++ 2000s
So you ain't with the State no more? +++$+++ 1950s
Maybe she's right. +++$+++ 1990s
The ship's real enough.  So its anchorage must be a real place. Where is it? +++$+++ 2000s
The sailor's omen of good fortune. The hunter watching over him on his travels. +++$+++ 2000s
A mistake... +++$+++ 1980s
Not one bit. +++$+++ 1990s
I'm very angry with you, George.  Very angry.  You don't take me to California, but you take your bitch wife?  A woman? I understand you love her, but it was you and me who started this.  You and me. +++$+++ 2000s
I can see her if I want to.  I mean, with half of France in the hands of the English, what have I got to lose? +++$+++ 2000s
Pardon me? +++$+++ 1990s
Surprised? +++$+++ 1970s
Not my choice of toast, but it's your call. To your triumph over Annette. +++$+++ 1990s
People usually have to get to know me before they hate me. +++$+++ 1990s
Holding the president hostage is not something that slips your mind when you're making demands. +++$+++ 1990s
Yeah... +++$+++ 1990s
Would I?!! Why I oughta... +++$+++ 1980s
I expect. +++$+++ 1980s
Great.  Hi. I'm Erica. +++$+++ 1990s
Thank you.  Now I'll tell you why I know Wynant didn't commit those murders -  Three months ago - the night that he caught you in Julia's apartment, he found out that Julia was cheating him, and was splitting with some man.  He went to find the man. That man was.... Tanner, don't you...? +++$+++ 1930s
Where's the pinto going? +++$+++ 1980s
Ja, ja, ja. +++$+++ 1940s
I'm pretty good at signatures myself. +++$+++ 2000s
So modest. +++$+++ 2000s
Whatever!  You know how he gets.  Well, he went absolutely bonkers.  Lucy and I were frantically trying to scramble into the dumb waiter and I didn't fit any more. It was almost fatal.  And that, my dear friends, is the day... +++$+++ 2000s
This is America. There is nothing you can not buy. +++$+++ 1990s
You misinterpret everything.  We've all been friends our whole lives.  But that's the types of relationship you wouldn't understand. +++$+++ 1990s
Like me, too. +++$+++ 1990s
Stool pigeon. +++$+++ 1990s
You did go through my stuff. +++$+++ 1990s
Hi, Barney! +++$+++ 1990s
STAY WITH HIM! TIGHTEN YOUR TURN! +++$+++ 1980s
What else? Say more. +++$+++ 1990s
Well find some other way!  Be creative.  Tell them she fucks the devil... Hmm, not a bad idea... why can't you say that?  Sounds good to me... and who can prove she doesn't? +++$+++ 2000s
On the dark nights — on the stormy nights -- you can hear him. He passes like the wind; The flapping and fluttering of his great cloak beating like gaunt wings. The thunder of his horse's hooves is loud, loud and louder, beating hard, beating strong on the frozen ground as he comes riding, riding, riding. +++$+++ 1940s
I'm out, Frank. You lost faith in me. +++$+++ 1980s
So, Ruth. How's Sam? +++$+++ 2000s
What's this? +++$+++ 2000s
Let me see your hand. +++$+++ 2000s
Mary, people come to him voluntarily. +++$+++ 2000s
Hey there.  I was beginnin' to think you wasn't comin' back...  You don't look so good. +++$+++ 1990s
It pissed off a lot of parents. According to Kristen, they hunted him down; roasted him alive. +++$+++ 1980s
I know.  What can I do?  He is the boss. +++$+++ 1990s
It is to me! An' if I hafta bust way outta this place to see it, I will! +++$+++ 1970s
I went to the bank to see why. They said you emptied our accounts-- +++$+++ 1990s
Yes. +++$+++ 1970s
Oh my God. +++$+++ 1990s
It's exquisite - like a floating mansion. +++$+++ 1950s
I couldn't do it, Leah! It smelled like a dentist in there. They had these really horrible magazines, with, like, spritz cookie recipes and bad fiction and water stains, like someone read them in the tub. And the receptionist tried to give me these weird condoms that looked like grape suckers, and she told me about her boyfriend's pie balls, and Su-Chin Kuah was there, and she told me the baby had fingernails. Fingernails! +++$+++ 2000s
Yes sir. +++$+++ 1990s
I had ordered some books. "The 100 Greatest Books Ever Written." +++$+++ 1990s
I don't say he was a man like an Earthman, but I'd call him a close relative, for he was plagued by most of man's ills.  Yet, fragile as he was, he came before you -- and was superior to you. +++$+++ 2000s
If Cornwallis receives news that Clinton is coming, he'll simply hold tight and wait.  He'll fight a purely defensive battle and he'll win that. +++$+++ 2000s
IMF mainframe. +++$+++ 1990s
Now you've got all the ones with beards on one side and all the moustaches on the other. +++$+++ 1980s
You are... +++$+++ 2000s
Aces, Suits. +++$+++ 2000s
I hadn't planned on it. +++$+++ 1990s
He's dead. I want the General to see him. +++$+++ 1940s
You watch your back Hammer. Hanukkah might just be his first move. For all we know Kwanzaa could be next. There's a lot of brothers counting on you. If you fail... +++$+++ 2000s
This one will just stun ya, but this one will put ya to sleep. +++$+++ 2000s
No. What you usually say, I guess. +++$+++ 1960s
I done my shopping in Seoul last night. +++$+++ 1970s
So what?!  So fucking what?  Use your head, Violet.  The money is gone.  Gino is coming here to get it.  You think he's going to believe me if I tell him his piss-hole son stole it!  Is that what you think? I don't.  You know what I think?  I think I'm a dead man.  I'm one in the brain.  That's what I think! +++$+++ 1990s
What is it? Has he found him? +++$+++ 1930s
Sir, Mr. Philby is here. +++$+++ 2000s
Can we make breakaway speed!? +++$+++ 1980s
I have been nothing but myself since the day I was born. And if you can't see that, it's your failing, not mine. +++$+++ 2000s
How would like some Salisbury Steak with buttered noodles? +++$+++ 1990s
I've done that before. +++$+++ 1980s
Maybe a political operative of some sort-- +++$+++ 1970s
I'll see you. +++$+++ 1950s
I see. +++$+++ 1990s
How do you know it was a 'he'? +++$+++ 1970s
Railroad burned him out too. You couldn't have stopped him. +++$+++ 2000s
That's what our General Contractor told us but how can you trust someone like that? +++$+++ 1990s
You mean, like to throw 'em off? +++$+++ 2000s
Yes, I could.  I have an office in the hospital. +++$+++ 1990s
Stop it, Jez. Don't do that. +++$+++ 1990s
I know, I know. I had no idea -- +++$+++ 1990s
Do?  What can you do?  What did you expect?  He wasn't Jewish. Did you know bow they live?  Your father would never stay out this late without calling.  In thirty years he never stayed out all night. +++$+++ 1990s
We think there's a strong reason to believe it may be hiding inside one of the buildings within the sequestered area. +++$+++ 1990s
It's not that hard to find it in there, Jack--it'll take you just a minute. You just gotta go fishin'. +++$+++ 1990s
Don't be.  Nothing to be scared about, honey, I been through four years of war - this is nothing. +++$+++ 1990s
Don't you think I know that!  Put Hans on!  Hans, listen to me, that shithead doesn't know what kind of scum you are, but I do -- +++$+++ 1980s
Who sent you?!  Who sent you? +++$+++ 1990s
'Neutron Man'... 'Laser Man'... I can see why. 'Tarantula Man'... +++$+++ 1970s
Just get one hand against each ear there--keep his face straight up. +++$+++ 1930s
Have the car running at the north- west checkpoint. Bob and I'll -- +++$+++ 1990s
What's wrong with you? +++$+++ 2000s
Lucky, I guess. +++$+++ 2000s
Charlie -- are you going to make a point soon? +++$+++ 1990s
Jake.  I thought you would be at work, dear. +++$+++ 1970s
Come on, sweetheart -- what is this? Who's coming? +++$+++ 1990s
Maybe you can talk sense into your boyfriend. +++$+++ 1990s
A buck a shot. +++$+++ 1990s
Unprofessional. +++$+++ 1990s
What would <u>that</u> be? +++$+++ 2000s
Yes, Mister Harding? +++$+++ 1970s
Okay. +++$+++ 1970s
Oh yeah. They good. Can't say they ain't good. I wouldn't trade them for another pair, tell you that. But you come back in a few days - give me a chance to lead'em to it. All right? +++$+++ 1990s
He was my college sweetie! Look at him. He looks so handsome on t.v. What the hell is he doing in Panama. +++$+++ 1990s
Yeah, they dig him up and cart him back.  He gets thawed out, wakes up and scares the shit out of them. And they get into one hell of a brawl... +++$+++ 1980s
Is that true? +++$+++ 1930s
Well, at least the bastard can't climb.  Pardon my French. +++$+++ 1990s
I'm going to see the Diva sing. What's the matter?... Do I look bad? +++$+++ 1990s
Well you tell him ta take it easy with that. He's gotta learn ta respect women the way Connor does. +++$+++ 1990s
Mostly caffeine diuretics.  Help you go to the bathroom. +++$+++ 1990s
Yes Commander? +++$+++ 1990s
What do you think? +++$+++ 1970s
He saw an owl. +++$+++ 1990s
They would? +++$+++ 1930s
Your hair's different. +++$+++ 1980s
What's that supposed to mean? +++$+++ 1990s
...tonight... +++$+++ 1990s
Why?  What's wrong with me? +++$+++ 1990s
About a year and a half. +++$+++ 1990s
Nell... please, Nell... take a deep breath... +++$+++ 1990s
Thank you, Mr. Scott. I'll try not to take that personally.  My friends... I can't ask you to go any further. Dr. McCoy and I have to do this. The rest of you do not. +++$+++ 1980s
Tonight I want to relax with you. The Senator from Nevada is here with some people from Washington. I want to show them a good time in Havana. +++$+++ 1970s
One little guy with a cheap rifle - look what he can do. +++$+++ 1990s
Sounds perfect. I can park my car back there? +++$+++ 1990s
What do I tell your mother? +++$+++ 1990s
It better be. +++$+++ 1990s
Why do you think he did it? +++$+++ 1990s
Did you wish to see someone? +++$+++ 1980s
I'll call you. +++$+++ 1970s
Cecelia is, well...you know +++$+++ 2000s
That's over. I got tired of translating everything. She thought the Big Hopper was a hamburger. +++$+++ 1980s
He's gonna be okay. Could do a bit. +++$+++ 2000s
Let' s do it. +++$+++ 1990s
Do you think that's what he wants? +++$+++ 1990s
Ah.  A philosopher. +++$+++ 1990s
I see without seeing. To me, darkness is as clear as daylight. What am I? +++$+++ 1990s
Can't Tiny drive us to a phone? +++$+++ 2000s
One guess. +++$+++ 2000s
Do you realize that I work at him? +++$+++ 1990s
Banana cream, pineapple cream, chocolate cream--and apple. +++$+++ 1940s
Alla puttanesca. +++$+++ 2000s
I've come to see you, sir, about an Auction... +++$+++ 2000s
See the cross of the Lord. Be gone you hostile power. O'Lord hear my prayer. +++$+++ 1970s
You get the money? +++$+++ 1990s
It's nothing personal data. You have to remember these people have rejected technology. And you... +++$+++ 1990s
Well, I should say! +++$+++ 1930s
What's 'incidentals?' +++$+++ 2000s
They don't serve wine here. +++$+++ 2000s
You told us about the appearance of this... voice.  What exactly did you see?  Part of it... or all of it? +++$+++ 2000s
Don't worry -- I've never seen men so determined. You've given them a way to fight... And I don't think -- +++$+++ 1980s
Yeah, they suck. +++$+++ 1990s
You don't have to do a thing. Chemically we are already quite sympathetic. +++$+++ 1930s
Do you remember? +++$+++ 1990s
So where's the party? +++$+++ 1990s
What's it about? +++$+++ 2000s
Do I wanna go to Memphis and get married? +++$+++ 1990s
They are?  Have you ever eaten with one?  Liebkind, go!  Kill! +++$+++ 1960s
I was, wasn't I?  I was John fucking Malkovich!  Take me back, Craig. +++$+++ 1990s
And that's what caused the contamination? +++$+++ 2000s
HARRY and I have been talking about school. In fact, I want to ask you something. +++$+++ 2000s
Look on the bright side.  If we miss the rent, what's the worst they can do? +++$+++ 1990s
And suddenly, Steve, suddenly you notice that they like you. They honour you, suddenly you are the director of the best museum in the world, for example. +++$+++ 2000s
I--I don't know. I--I'm afraid they've got me licked. +++$+++ 1930s
I have to throw up... +++$+++ 1980s
No...look I'm busy... +++$+++ 1950s
You know how I feel? +++$+++ 1970s
Top drawer. Maybe if you didn't call me ma'am, things would work out better. +++$+++ 1960s
Sometimes a story is a mask for a covert operation.  See-- two men killed in a restroom, and two unidentified men in a running					* shootout, ending at the						* Marriot... +++$+++ 1990s
You're wanted at the C.O.'s. +++$+++ 1990s
What do you think he did? +++$+++ 1990s
Mary Sue? +++$+++ 1990s
Best speed to Regula I. Kirk out. Scotty, I've got to ask: Any chance of getting the mains back on the line? +++$+++ 1980s
I feel strange being here with you... without David knowing. +++$+++ 1970s
And she's a stinking fucking actress, for fuck's sake. +++$+++ 2000s
What do you think you're doing?! +++$+++ 1990s
I don't see any eyes...must be totally subterranean...and those tentacles... +++$+++ 1990s
Hood residence. +++$+++ 1990s
How would you like to give Frau Schulz a pair of silk stockings for Christmas? +++$+++ 1950s
What! +++$+++ 1970s
We ain't exactly in what you'd call your high traffic neighborhood either. +++$+++ 2000s
*                     We could always put you in a duck blind with a twelve gauge.  The second amendment types'll love that. +++$+++ 1990s
About anything. +++$+++ 1990s
Never saw the point of 'em. +++$+++ 2000s
I've never even met you. +++$+++ 2000s
I like this. I like doing business in the home. It's cozy...  Who's birthday? +++$+++ 2000s
Who the hell are they? +++$+++ 1990s
What do you want, Courtney? +++$+++ 2000s
Yeah. +++$+++ 1990s
...And one of those guys was you! The last one, I might add, which-if you're too stupid to comprehend- means that I've been faithful to you since we met! All the other guys I went with before I met you, so, if you want to have a complex about it, go ahead!  But don't look at me like I'm the town whore, because you were plenty busy yourself, before you met me! +++$+++ 1990s
Where are we going? +++$+++ 2000s
The 2-3.  Homicide. +++$+++ 2000s
I was the world's sweetest ingenue. +++$+++ 1930s
Parading's better! +++$+++ 1960s
After all, Mr. Roundy, we're paying six percent. Six percent. FHA's at eight and a half -- no, we won't be going back to the old days. +++$+++ 1970s
I've seen you going by on your board, but I didn't realize -- you're so young... to be so... +++$+++ 1990s
Us is over.  You had your chance you blew it. +++$+++ 1980s
Now is that clear? +++$+++ 1990s
Hi, doll, what's wrong? +++$+++ 1970s
There's an autopsy ordered at Bellevue immediately. You better skip over there. +++$+++ 1930s
Short? It's ended. +++$+++ 1990s
No matter how many times I leave the toilet seat up, she forgets and puts it down. +++$+++ 1990s
Yes. It is unfortunate. +++$+++ 1930s
I know what I have to know. +++$+++ 1990s
I *don't* think that's the thing to do! No! I think what you ought to do is--*fight*! +++$+++ 1930s
What are you doing? +++$+++ 1980s
I already know you think you're worthless.  I recommend you learn to think of yourself in a better light, for what you believe you are is what you become.  I haven't been involved in anything like this for many years. +++$+++ 1970s
Please... be cool. +++$+++ 1980s
Not before you agree to use those reservations to Moscow. +++$+++ 1930s
You could tell me your name. And where you're going. +++$+++ 1990s
You lame Taylor? +++$+++ 1980s
You bastard... +++$+++ 1990s
Let us put it to the test. Protect yourself with every scientific precaution you can think of. I'll go out on the cliff and build a votive fire to Hermes -- not that I believe in him any more than I do in Science. +++$+++ 1940s
Will Senator Smith yield to his colleague? +++$+++ 1930s
What have I done? +++$+++ 1990s
Can I come in? +++$+++ 1990s
The Joker is a murderer. And you were as good as dead. So -- +++$+++ 1980s
I am beginning to know Mr. Nehru. +++$+++ 1980s
Relax, son. They'll learn in time that you don't fuck with First Bank. This is the real deal and we aim to keep it strong. My Daddy always told me that Only The Strong Survive. +++$+++ 2000s
Yeah, that's right, Frank, you better ask him. I mean, don't hurt his feelin's or anything, but it would be good to know. I'm sure it's nothin'. He seems real sweet. +++$+++ 1990s
I want him! +++$+++ 1980s

I'm not. He does walk funny. Don't you see that? +++$+++ 1970s
Huh? +++$+++ 2000s
The people killed were mauled and their brains were eaten.  Just like Beauregard.  One part of the brain was extracted with surgical precision.  The hypothalamus and thalamus to be exact. +++$+++ 1990s
I knew she was Japanese going into it, but she didn't tell me the ninja assassin part-- +++$+++ 1990s
I ratchet your ignition mechanism ... +++$+++ 2000s
Besides, I'm not stupid, Earl. The tape was a basic Maxell D-80.  You can buy 'em at any store.  There's no way they can pin anything on me. +++$+++ 1990s
I feel fine. +++$+++ 1970s
Congratulations. You should spit in my face. +++$+++ 2000s
Oh--a wonderful thing--yes. Get you right in the mood--yes--yes. +++$+++ 1930s
Now go to sleep.  It's very late. +++$+++ 1970s

We've got our best people on it, Mr. Sayer. +++$+++ 2010s
She knew what was going to happen to me. That's why she hid me away. +++$+++ 1980s
My skin's dry, my exoskeleton is cracking...I wish I'd never met you, you ruined my life. +++$+++ 1990s
Have them sealed off. +++$+++ 1990s

Am I hurting you? +++$+++ 1990s
No!  No!  I can't do this! +++$+++ 1990s
A mistake. +++$+++ 1990s
Just for curiosity sake that's all? +++$+++ 1990s
How's yours? +++$+++ 1970s
I think I saw a TV show like that when I was a kid.  Where a boy... +++$+++ 1990s
What about "climbing in?" +++$+++ 2000s
I believe in you, me, and Rock and Roll. And I'm not too sure about you lately. +++$+++ 1980s
Eight forty-two, sir. +++$+++ 1930s
I am a Starfleet Officer. +++$+++ 1980s
Oh, yes, of course. But where are we going? +++$+++ 1980s
We almost had an accident today. DeJesus' suit... +++$+++ 1980s
You sure? +++$+++ 1990s
How did you hurt your hand? +++$+++ 1990s
How will you fix it? +++$+++ 2000s
Well, if the A.T.F. guy is the one who wants you, that'll only interest him up to a point. +++$+++ 1990s
Leaving what? +++$+++ 1990s

That goddamn Neanderthal? I'm the one who gave him the idea for the combination bug spray-sun screen! Did you know that?! +++$+++ 2000s
Did your mother know you were going to see your father? +++$+++ 1970s
Smart gal. +++$+++ 1930s
It's not good enough. +++$+++ 1990s
Can't make enough swords! +++$+++ 1980s
No, I don't. +++$+++ 2000s
What's your fucking problem? +++$+++ 2000s
Money problems? +++$+++ 1990s
Come on, daddy-o. You haven't said a word since we started. Least you could do is make some friendly conversation. +++$+++ 2000s
Well, I live downtown. +++$+++ 1980s
Dad, look what I drew. +++$+++ 1990s
You'll have a hard time finding a woman like that these days -- +++$+++ 1990s
You want to fuck her? +++$+++ 2000s
You were very careless with our precious jewels, my dear. They're too expensive a toy for two children to play with. +++$+++ 1930s
What, though?  It can't be the Republicans--he'd never allow something as stupid as this, not when he's gonna slaughter McGovern anyway. +++$+++ 1970s
Ah! My lady! The tide waits for no man, but I swear it would wait for you! +++$+++ 1990s
Simon's home. I was sort of hoping you could keep the dog until he's had a chance to think and adjust... +++$+++ 1990s
What kind of activity? +++$+++ 2000s
If you did that, you'd get nothing except the police after you. If you wait -- I'll give you your six thousand back -- +++$+++ 1930s
Read the inscription on the cover! +++$+++ 1990s
When I said I’d never done a wedding before, I didn’t say that no one ever asked. I just never said yes. +++$+++ 2000s
Kristen's story really got to her. +++$+++ 1980s
Mary, we really have to go. +++$+++ 1990s
I don't have to tell you what a comfort anonymity can be in my profession -- like a warm blanket.  My deal with Job was subject to a successful boot scan.  Obviously it didn't pass muster.  Deal's off. +++$+++ 1990s
Freddy Krueger.  He was a child murderer before he died.  After he died, he became ...something worse.  Six years ago Freddy killed my friends. He almost killed me.  I thought I got rid of him -- but I guess he was too strong. +++$+++ 1980s
Everything I...you know... +++$+++ 1990s
I'll take it from here --  I am -- +++$+++ 1990s

Well, it was nice meeting you again, Mr. Stephens. +++$+++ 1990s
Well, there's fishing and boating. There's concerts on the mainland and... but I feel silly telling you. This is really your home. You probably know better than I what there is to do. +++$+++ 1970s
Well, it's Friday night and you're a beautiful girl. I guess you would have a date, that does that. +++$+++ 1980s
I'm really sorry. +++$+++ 1990s

Stop fooling around in there. +++$+++ 1990s
Thank you. honey. +++$+++ 1980s
Colson doesn't know about it; he's pure as a virgin on this one.  It's just not clear the burglars knew what they were looking for.  They were heading to McGovern's office later that night. +++$+++ 1990s
Bobby laid his own tracks.  He could have gone quietly but he played the hard-ass con till the end. And as far as I'm concerned, he wife and kid are a hell of a lot better off without him.  Now take the money. +++$+++ 2000s
I'm serious. This is how you do it. I'm telling you. +++$+++ 1990s

I was freezing from the hurricane -- +++$+++ 2000s
We were due to go back out on the same ship. Six months of tests.  If you were married you got a state-room.  Otherwise it was bunks. +++$+++ 1980s
Why would she come here... +++$+++ 1990s
Listen, son, you gonna get smart, you can leave right now. +++$+++ 1970s
So we have a chance of getting back together again. +++$+++ 2000s
Whatever I say, you'll take him away, won't you? +++$+++ 1980s
Can you drive? +++$+++ 1990s
Poor Harry, I wish he was dead, he would be safe from all of you then. +++$+++ 1940s
He needs a doctor. +++$+++ 2000s
They're on me. They're smoking me out! +++$+++ 1990s
I know. +++$+++ 2000s
Don't cross Gordon. He'll crush you. You've worked hard to get where you are. If Gordon doesn't buy Bluestar someone else will; and who's to say they won't do the same thing. +++$+++ 1980s
If the house is empty again, I don't know -- +++$+++ 1930s

I've got to go see Gruber.    What's the best cigars you have? +++$+++ 1970s

The Dark Prince is here. +++$+++ 2000s
He's got an answer for everything, but he doesn't have an alibi. +++$+++ 1990s

You say the cutest things. +++$+++ 1950s
No, nothing's like it used to be. +++$+++ 1990s
We inspected the body, Marquis. She died a virgin. +++$+++ 2000s
The same windows. +++$+++ 2000s
Wellllll, if you read it it must be true. Was it in the Star, or the Enquirer? +++$+++ 1990s
She will, Mr.  LaLoosh, she will ... +++$+++ 1980s
This nigger's breaking up my place, Sheriff Langston. +++$+++ 1980s
Go, girl, seek happy nights to happy days. +++$+++ 1960s
You said that? +++$+++ 1970s
It's got nothing to do with my mother! She's had leukemia for -- ! This is what makes me boil about him! HE wants me back! -- it's got nothing to do with my mother. +++$+++ 1990s
Yeah. I bet he would. +++$+++ 1990s
Whatever suggested the idea to you? +++$+++ 1990s
Relax, will you. +++$+++ 1990s

What do you mean "grand theft auto?" This is insane. +++$+++ 2000s
Yeah. Before I kick your ass. +++$+++ 1990s

I resent God's monopoly. +++$+++ 1930s
You are not allowed to act this way. +++$+++ 1990s
Yeah. How did you know? +++$+++ 1970s
He's already got one mother, he doesn't need two...He's yours...  I won't fight you for him any more. He's yours... +++$+++ 1970s
... and maybe the king will give you some money, and a little land, and a title even...  ... wouldn't that be a fine thing? You, a lady of title! +++$+++ 2000s
It’s okay. The cops did it. +++$+++ 1980s
Yeah! No more clicks and whistles! Now she speaks perfect English! +++$+++ 2000s
I'm not interested in your literary recommendations. +++$+++ 1930s
I want to talk to Leon. +++$+++ 1970s
Yeah.  It was all over after Buford nailed Seaver's first pitch outta the park. +++$+++ 2000s
The Prosecutor objected to your sentence for possession; he wanted a smuggling conviction and the High Court in Ankara reviewed it. +++$+++ 1970s
Where'd that come from? He holds up a giant key chain. +++$+++ 2000s
...An attempt at humor, I suppose. +++$+++ 2000s
So... Board convenes tomorrow, you'll recommend, we close and it's a deal, right? +++$+++ 1990s
A magician *makes* magic.  Any fool can use it. +++$+++ 1980s
I wish it could all have been different. +++$+++ 1980s

Why'd call me a killer? +++$+++ 1950s
"To Daddy from Amy." Here's one for Miss Callahan. This one says, "To Edward from Amy.". +++$+++ 1940s

Forgiveness? +++$+++ 1990s
So is Dewey your real name? +++$+++ 1990s
Twins, Max. Sixteen-year-olds. Can you imagine the mathematical possibilities? +++$+++ 1970s
Yes, see, they move very easily through the Pleistocene Alluvials...  ...the dirt...the loose soil that makes up the valley floor.  But they can't move through solid rock. I think we should travel west to the mountains. +++$+++ 1990s
We need more bread and some baked lasa--  uh, lasagne.  Hi. +++$+++ 1980s
Robert asks about you. When are you going to do something to help him? +++$+++ 1990s
What religion do you profess, Preacher? +++$+++ 1950s
Maybe. But this isn't about living or dying. It's about good versus evil, and we're good, whether we like it or not... Maybe we look a little funny... +++$+++ 1990s
But there's nothing here. +++$+++ 2000s
Oh, uh, listen, David called me up. +++$+++ 1980s
No, I celebrate at the beginning of my corporate tax year which is March first. That way I beat the crowds. +++$+++ 1980s
Are you still coming? +++$+++ 1990s
I'll see ya around, huh? +++$+++ 1990s
How true. But I still feel I deserve more than you do of this treasure. I mean, I found it. +++$+++ 2000s
What do you do? +++$+++ 1960s
No. +++$+++ 1970s
No, I believed her. She was in pretty bad shape. Inside and out. But the boys were never formally charged. +++$+++ 2000s
What makes you think I would do that? +++$+++ 1990s
This isn't our goddamn game! +++$+++ 2000s

Why don't you shut up now. +++$+++ 2000s
But -- +++$+++ 1980s
Now release the brake. And slide the stick into first gear. +++$+++ 2000s
Afraid not. +++$+++ 1990s
Good-bye, Peter. +++$+++ 1980s
Thank you. +++$+++ 1930s

What's the thing? +++$+++ 1990s
Alright, let's boot up. +++$+++ 1990s

Got it. +++$+++ 1990s
Alvy, uh, let's face it. You know something, don't think our relationship is working. +++$+++ 1970s
Yeah, and we do it twenty times a day.  Don't give me that crap. Just put on the taps.  Now. +++$+++ 1990s
And you just want to ask me a few questions? +++$+++ 1970s
Yeah, right.  I don't know why I bothered inviting you guys.  I knew you wouldn't show. +++$+++ 2000s
That's lucky. +++$+++ 1990s

Well, what does it have to do with? Us? +++$+++ 1990s
We could send Mac.  If he can retrieve one suit, we could go back for the other. +++$+++ 1990s
How is he? +++$+++ 1990s
Let me know. +++$+++ 1990s
President Kennedy threatened to smash the CIA into a thousand pieces.  You could do the same ... +++$+++ 1990s
Man, all it got to do is find their weak spot.  You bet on the machine in any fight you name, you gonna win your bet. +++$+++ 1980s

Well, sure! +++$+++ 1980s
I sell biscuits and gravy all over the Southland-- +++$+++ 1990s
Adrenaline's wearing off.  You get shaky after.  It's not uncommon.  Deep breathing helps. +++$+++ 2000s
How'd you find out? +++$+++ 1990s
Why? +++$+++ 2000s
No, you're not. You're a good doctor, Lonnie, but you're not David Ravell. I've made my decision. Now, if you'll excuse me... +++$+++ 2000s

Moving to Sweden. +++$+++ 2000s
Well, you see, I've acquired one of those new mother-in-laws, and we were afraid she wouldn't understand the whole idea. So we were going to wait till she went to Europe. +++$+++ 1930s
It was weird... +++$+++ 1990s
Well, John, the night before your father died, he told me what he did with that money. +++$+++ 1950s
Then why don't you start practicing and keep your mouth shut for a while? +++$+++ 1990s
Something to drink, Dr. Bright? +++$+++ 1990s
Exciting, wasn't it? Where's Jimmy? +++$+++ 1930s
Come on, I thought we had fun, rich boy -- +++$+++ 2000s
To talk. +++$+++ 1990s
I tell you, I saw them! +++$+++ 1930s
They have cemeteries. But not like this one... You see, they don't have any wars. +++$+++ 2000s
If I hadn't done it.  If I'd said to myself, "Screw it.  I'm going to let all those people down there live." +++$+++ 1970s
He had a mother and father -- and he knew them. +++$+++ 1970s
You were missed.  How long has it been since we've seen each other? +++$+++ 1990s
Oh no. Are you kidding me? +++$+++ 1960s

We'll be on the other side waiting for you. If you become food I don't want the only set of keys in the belly of one of those things. It's your funeral. +++$+++ 2000s
You realize that you've brought a killer into the house. +++$+++ 2000s

I... because I want to go home. She said she'd come and get me. +++$+++ 1990s
You still don't get the picture do you? I've always heard what a smart ass operator you are. +++$+++ 1970s
That?  Oh, it's a kind of Chinese fighting... I was sort of caught once with a lovely Chinese girl out in San Francisco.  Her big brothers were kind enough to teach it to me  I've got a book on it, if you're interested. +++$+++ 1990s
This is such a mess.  I come to you to protect myself against more crappy gossip and now I'm landed in it all over again.  For God's sake, I've got a boyfriend. +++$+++ 1990s

So? +++$+++ 1990s
You're flushed.  And you were moaning. I think you're running a fever.  What are you doing? +++$+++ 1990s
Something's gone wrong -- something unanticipated. Go back to Dallas and dig. Or you're only going to find out like the rest of the country, Agent Mulder. When it's too late. +++$+++ 1990s
Oh hey, one more thing? +++$+++ 2000s
...trust the wisdom of the ancients, trust the Great Mother to protect us... Why. are you staring at me like that? +++$+++ 1980s

Yeah. +++$+++ 1990s
And I'll take that certified check, too. I've decided I can handle things around here... +++$+++ 1940s
Hitting bottom isn't a weekend retreat!  It's not a seminar!  You have to forget everything you know, everything you think you know -- about life, about friendship, about you and me. +++$+++ 1990s
Prettier than Ann? +++$+++ 1980s
What I resent, lieutenant, is some politician using my base as a test tube for her grand social experiment.  What I resent is the sensitivity training that is now mandatory for my men... the day-care center I have to build where an officer's lounge used to be... and the OB/GYN I have to keep on staff just so someone can keep track of your personal pap smears.  But most of all, lieutenant, I resent your perfume, however subtle it may be, competing with the aroma of my fine three-dollar-and-fifty- nine cent cigar, which I will happily put out this very instant if the phallic nature of it happens to offend your goddamn fragile sensibilities.  DOES IT? +++$+++ 1990s
He wanted you to know the legal limit for hexavalent chromium, is .05 parts per million.  And that at the rate you mentioned, .58, it could be responsible for the cancers in that family you asked about. The Irvings. +++$+++ 2000s
Good.  That was the plan.  We couldn't stand him and George needed help. +++$+++ 2000s
No.  Just no. +++$+++ 1970s
Five years is a long time. +++$+++ 1990s
The Prince does not like to be touched by other humans. A Silly eastern superstition, I'm afraid. +++$+++ 1990s
I can't wait to hear your opening argument.	"Ladies and Gentlemen	of the Jury... the Defense will prove that Jason Voorhees did not kill all of these people. They, in fact, committed mass suicide and then buried themselves in his back yard..." +++$+++ 2000s
No. +++$+++ 1990s
This is not a bender yet.  This is the start of a bender.  But I can see how you were confused, they look a lot alike. +++$+++ 2000s
As far away as I ever want to be. +++$+++ 1930s
All the time. They're everywhere.  You won't tell anyone my secret, right? +++$+++ 1990s
Something's coming. +++$+++ 1980s
This would be a bad time for me to leave. +++$+++ 1990s
What is it? +++$+++ 1990s
Elephants! Make way... I gotta get elephants! +++$+++ 1970s
Great.  Another deadbeat. +++$+++ 2000s
But that's what happened before. +++$+++ 2000s
It was one incident. +++$+++ 1980s
More... many more. +++$+++ 1970s
That's no shampoo.  It'smore like a pile of freehly laundred hand- kerchiefs, like a brand new auto- mobile.  How old are you anyway? +++$+++ 1950s
Sure, sure, sure. You go on home and talk about it to your wife. +++$+++ 1940s
No. +++$+++ 2000s
Yeah, somebody broke in and stole the samples, one of those animal rights groups, right?  I remember now, they freed all the monkeys which caused that huge pileup on the Massachusetts Turnpike, right? +++$+++ 1990s
We were worried about you guys so we left early to see if you were -- +++$+++ 1990s
Well, how far didya get? +++$+++ 1960s
I need to talk to Annette. +++$+++ 1990s
Yeah. +++$+++ 1990s
Yes, but listen. Christ, I didn't kill him. +++$+++ 2000s
You got a chisel round here? +++$+++ 1990s
I wish I could do more but we're moving out. +++$+++ 1990s
No.  Invite us?  No, he simply... +++$+++ 2000s
God help them. +++$+++ 2000s
Well, I don't know. He sits arounna house alla time. You know a place he can go where he can find a bride? +++$+++ 1950s
If you don't complete the assignment, you'll get a zero for the day. +++$+++ 2000s
He's not gonna be happy. And your parents can't be too thrilled either. +++$+++ 1980s
Do you really think you have a chance against us, Mr. Cowboy? +++$+++ 1980s
What the hell do you know? +++$+++ 2000s
Yeah, that's fascinating, but I'm just a fat, dumb cop lookin' for a psycho killer-- +++$+++ 2000s
I don't care about that. This time, I gotta have the rent. +++$+++ 1990s
You're not leaving. Not until we go back for the others. +++$+++ 2000s
Whatta you say we wait and give him a tail? +++$+++ 1970s
No. No thank you. +++$+++ 1990s
He's trying to form words. +++$+++ 2000s
Is he from here? +++$+++ 1970s
From what I've seen, Paden doesn't care much about money. +++$+++ 1980s
It's clean. +++$+++ 1990s
What do you want me to say? +++$+++ 2000s
From Carl Heine's boat.  All his were like this one, three-strand manila, new condition, braided in loops.  Not bowlined like Miyamoto's. +++$+++ 1990s
That's exactly my point.  Has he even directed actors before in anything? +++$+++ 2000s
Wow, a treasure map! What's the treasure? +++$+++ 2000s
I'll tell him we'll take two. +++$+++ 1980s
Yes. +++$+++ 1990s
It's okay, Mike... +++$+++ 1990s
Some people are very shy by nature. +++$+++ 1970s
How...how are you here? +++$+++ 2000s
Mercutio +++$+++ 1990s
Got what? +++$+++ 1990s
No can do. Life goes on, pointfive ... You left me, remember? +++$+++ 2000s
First of all, economic reasons.  It was cheap.  The entire project cost just a fraction of what we spent in a single year on our various space and missile programs. It also seemed ideal in most other respects. It was terrifying, convincing, automatic, and extremely simple to understand. +++$+++ 1960s
Oh, you'll remember it some time. +++$+++ 1940s
Uh.. +++$+++ 1990s
It isn't a question of knowing what to do, it's knowing how to get in one that counts. +++$+++ 1930s
What's going on? +++$+++ 1990s
Then what are you doing here? Come on, people, let's go!  And Cooper... Put some pants on. +++$+++ 1990s
--Shhhhhhut upppp you fffffffreak! +++$+++ 1990s
Yes, Sir. But this -- creature is a special case. +++$+++ 2000s
This has to be a big mistake. +++$+++ 2000s
Is that yours? +++$+++ 1960s
Like my pistola. +++$+++ 2000s
She'll be here in a moment. She has a special surprise for you. +++$+++ 2000s
I came for love... +++$+++ 2000s
I miss her. I miss my wife. +++$+++ 2000s
You don't either.  We won't know anything until we find that guy and find out if he's alive or what. +++$+++ 1990s
Tell me Vincent.  Tell me what you think. +++$+++ 2000s
Oh, I'd better hurry back.  I don't want to miss one minute of it. +++$+++ 1960s
Shit! +++$+++ 2000s
There's a million dollars in there, maybe <u>two</u> million.  I'll give you half. +++$+++ 2000s
It's a good thing my family loves you. +++$+++ 2000s
No you're not!  This marriage was never consummated.  I'm getting an annulment! +++$+++ 1990s
Is it her that's bothering you--or your gardener? +++$+++ 1980s
...a Mrs. Doneghy called... I told you that. +++$+++ 1980s
Look at you, not even breaking a sweat. You're cool, boy.  You're cool. +++$+++ 1990s
Okay, "bro," this jig is up...  Just get in the bottle. Just slide right on in there. +++$+++ 2000s
Ed, how're you holding up? +++$+++ 2000s
No use waiting, then. +++$+++ 1990s
I wanted to give it all to the church. +++$+++ 2000s
Where's my bag? +++$+++ 1990s
No. +++$+++ 1970s
Parker. +++$+++ 2000s
I thought you were buying my company. +++$+++ 1990s
Get the hell out of here.''! +++$+++ 2000s
You...made that? +++$+++ 1950s
-Okay okay. +++$+++ 1980s
I may call you worse than that. +++$+++ 1980s
If we could change something in your life, anything at all, what would you like that to be? +++$+++ 1990s
We'll go to the country sometime, okay? +++$+++ 2000s
Eh, could I have my pen back now, please? +++$+++ 1970s
Oh. +++$+++ 1960s
She fucked us both. +++$+++ 1970s
We're supposed to be honest. +++$+++ 2000s
Okay. Well, you know, he's always been a nice guy and I like him. +++$+++ 1990s
Blue suit, gray suit, I'm still a fat man. A fat ugly man. +++$+++ 1950s
Hy-Brasil? +++$+++ 1980s
This is wonderfully accommodating of you all.  Now I won't have to come looking for you. +++$+++ 1990s
Yeah -- +++$+++ 1980s
Get a boob job. +++$+++ 1990s
I need your help. +++$+++ 2000s
You damn right they didn't, especially Emory, my cousin. +++$+++ 1990s
Sang. +++$+++ 1990s
The present city of Iskenderun is built on its ruins. Marcus -- you remember what the Grail Tablet said. "Across the desert and through the mountain to the Canyon of the Crescent Moon."  But where exactly? +++$+++ 1980s
Shit. Shit. I know it's here. Hold on. +++$+++ 2000s
So, hi there.  I'm... Sister Mary Clarence.  And you're... young Christians.  I guess I should assign you this passage.  What's good?  What were you talking about? +++$+++ 1990s
What would you like it to be to me...? I, I, I can't invest in failure. +++$+++ 1980s
This one , Lance? +++$+++ 1970s
I... I'm not sure...  ...I... oohhh... Excuse me... +++$+++ 1990s
And now that Wally's coming back, and because he'll certainly *need* you... +++$+++ 1990s
Yes, I'll tell you - for the same reason I've never wanted to go out with those social parasites, those sweet-smelling fashion plates. I don't like them. They bore me. They give me the jitters. +++$+++ 1930s
Between... +++$+++ 1990s
You know nothing about feelings, natural or unnatural. +++$+++ 1950s
Try me. +++$+++ 1930s
Don't cut me off. This is an emergency. +++$+++ 1990s
I'm sorry, Bull. It's never easy. He was a good soldier. +++$+++ 1980s
If it wouldn't be too much of a bother... a little bite to eat would be... +++$+++ 1980s
Sure you can. We gotta nail this guy. You'll be fine. +++$+++ 2000s
Need to have you check these out before he goes on that Walker benefit. +++$+++ 1970s
No. Grammoo said she's in heaven. +++$+++ 1990s
Really? +++$+++ 1990s
I think you might of dreamed this one, Anthony. +++$+++ 1990s
I think he called you beautiful. +++$+++ 1980s
What? Is there someone else? +++$+++ 1980s
Here goes nothing. +++$+++ 1980s
I've been trapped by Miles Kastle my whole life. She walks over to her scooter, and mounts it. +++$+++ 1990s
Well, darlin' <u>I</u> ain't your confessor.  Tell him you've got some info on the President's sex scandal, it's on your conscience, believe me, he'll drop what he's doing.  Okay;  <u>Now</u>:  Folks, folks, folks, this is a shitty business, and it needs no Ghost Come From the Grave to tell us that.  But in Six Days, Lord willing n'Jesus Tarries, I am going to take you beauties into the second term. .....wait til you hear the speech tonight.  The 3-0-3 Speech... where's the Fad King, by the way... +++$+++ 1990s
So I did! And what was so important about it? +++$+++ 1990s
You open it. +++$+++ 1990s
But have never been? +++$+++ 2000s
Admiral. Full power is restored. +++$+++ 1980s
Alfredo, go fuck yourself!!! +++$+++ 1980s
Oilie, that's for the children to play with. +++$+++ 1940s
So, I'm thinking prom is basically our last big chance. +++$+++ 1990s
Well, I don't know what else to say. It's a helluva party -- +++$+++ 1990s
I'm coming with you. +++$+++ 1990s
Turn off the light. +++$+++ 1990s
Come on, Doc, you must be kiddin'. +++$+++ 1970s
But a half million dollars! My goodness, where are we going to get— +++$+++ 1930s
TURK, what are you doing here? +++$+++ 2000s
It's too soon to know. +++$+++ 1990s
Thank you for this honor, my dear. +++$+++ 1990s
A small loan would be welcome. More urgently, I need access to a telephone and an address where things can be sent to me. +++$+++ 1990s
Why so remote, Addison? I should think you'd be at the side of your protegee, lending her moral support... +++$+++ 1950s
Oh. Thank you. +++$+++ 1970s
Go back to Bulgaria. +++$+++ 1940s
You took me to the house. +++$+++ 1990s
Uh, beg to differ. +++$+++ 1990s
That's probably good. +++$+++ 1990s
See that, I don't feel it. I can take it. I know I can take anybody. +++$+++ 1980s
Houdini's sick. +++$+++ 2000s
Say it not lightly...  Do you know its meaning? +++$+++ 1980s
They will want a lot of money. +++$+++ 1990s
Oh my G-d, they want me to anchor.  They want me to anchor tonight! +++$+++ 2000s
Take her out, Mr. Saavik. +++$+++ 1980s
10-4 good buddy. +++$+++ 1990s
Fine. But what would I do at night? +++$+++ 1990s
You're not with the FBI or anything, are you? +++$+++ 2000s
Where did he go? +++$+++ 2000s
The door's sealed from inside.  Doc Revna's in there, and it sounds like Ackland's going nuts. +++$+++ 1990s
You get off havin' control over me. Let me choose how to deal with it. +++$+++ 2000s
Sure -- He can hit -- Don't play no more -- Stick an' move, hear? +++$+++ 1970s
I know! +++$+++ 1980s
Yes, you should go. +++$+++ 1960s
H A R R Y... +++$+++ 2000s
Get a grip. Reed. We didn't come all this way to lose our nerve at the first little glitch. Just close the shields... +++$+++ 2000s
Fifteen and two thirds, actually. +++$+++ 1960s
...Ya gave Dipper my locker. +++$+++ 1970s
Nicholson and I go to work on him. Now er know somthing's rotten in Denmark, 'cause this dickhead had a big bag, and it's uncut, too, so we're sweatin' him, trying to find out where he got it. Scarin' the shit outta him. +++$+++ 1990s
It wasn't Toontown they wanted.  It was my idea of how to put the land to better use. +++$+++ 1980s
If he's not Madison, then where's Madison? +++$+++ 1990s
No. +++$+++ 1980s
Make it dry.  Baby doesn't like to be wet.  You're Valiant, right?  The name's Baby Herman. +++$+++ 1980s
Oh, nothin', you know. +++$+++ 1990s
Please!! NO!!! +++$+++ 1990s
-- I guess it's all got to do with this shop. +++$+++ 1970s
-- open circuit breakers -- +++$+++ 1970s
You just got a Mickey. +++$+++ 1980s
You gotta kill yourself. +++$+++ 2000s
Don't take any guff from those swine. Remember, if you have any trouble you can always send a telegram to the Right People. +++$+++ 1990s
Ben Corbett? +++$+++ 1990s
Tell me, Sheila. What are you afraid of? Sheila shakes her head. +++$+++ 1990s
Wherever he wants to. I think he's going back to Millsburg where he's from. It's just about twenty miles from here. +++$+++ 1990s
We'll ground her, clip her wings a bit.  School and scheduled activities and that's it until further notice. This has to be handled delicately. Dan Kelly, in the District Attorney's office, will probably help us out, quietly.  Christ, this could be embarrassing. +++$+++ 2000s
Yes..thank God.. +++$+++ 1990s
Lookin' to make the papers, John? +++$+++ 1990s
But how convenient that the proof of his arrival has vanished?  You also state that Bright Eyes had two intelligent companions at the time of his capture. +++$+++ 2000s
Merle, I wanna go home! +++$+++ 1970s
She's at work.  I'm her mother. +++$+++ 1990s
There's one thing I have to say.  I'm going away. +++$+++ 2000s
Seriously. +++$+++ 1990s
I don't know what we're talking about. +++$+++ 2000s
More clowning!  Don't you see? +++$+++ 1970s
Yeah. Because at one time, I didn't think enough. +++$+++ 2000s
Don Alonso de Bobadilla. +++$+++ 1990s
Bring out your dead! +++$+++ 1970s
Chairman Mao can keep China. Just give us back Tibet. +++$+++ 1990s
No... Not yet.  He's very shy... and very sensitive. +++$+++ 1990s
Were you ever bar mitzvahed anywhere else? +++$+++ 2000s
Okay. You read me well enough. Why can't I read you? +++$+++ 2000s
You mixed drinks bad as you mix metaphors, you be out of a job. +++$+++ 1990s
Why? +++$+++ 1980s
With eleven hundred he could come home, and that's the last thing I want. +++$+++ 2000s
She's with me. +++$+++ 1990s
Pretty much. +++$+++ 2000s
Help me with this one, I'm really screwed up. +++$+++ 1980s
Like I always say -- +++$+++ 2000s
Home. +++$+++ 1990s
Then it don't matter. Then I'll be all aroun' in the dark. I'll be ever'where--wherever you look. Wherever there's a fight so hungry people can eat, I'll be there. Wherever there's a cop beatin' up a guy, I'll be there. I'll be in the way guys yell when they're mad--an' I'll be in the way kids laugh when they're hungry an' they know supper's ready. An' when our people eat the stuff they raise, an' live in the houses they build, why, I'll be there too. +++$+++ 1940s
Okay. +++$+++ 1990s
...No money. +++$+++ 1990s
But meant her moving here. +++$+++ 1980s
I'm telling you so when you look back on this moment, you can think... there was this guy named Utah and he was pretty much a dork but maybe not such a bad person and I let him drown in conditions he had no business being in whatsoever... when I could have easily helped him. +++$+++ 1990s
OK, Bob. I don't know his name. You know why? Because I don't care. He's Future Man. But I care about you. And to me it doesn't make sense to go back to the scene of a crime. Will you get in the car, Bob? This is stupid. +++$+++ 1990s
I am quite...preoccupied with concern about Geordi. +++$+++ 1990s
Clear on starboard -- Where's Lance an' the Captain? +++$+++ 1970s
How long has it been? +++$+++ 1990s
This is a gift you'll not return. +++$+++ 1940s
Well, fact or not, I don't see how we're going to find an ancient cemetery in these mountains tonight.  I can't see a thing!  Let's turn back. +++$+++ 1960s
What are you saying?  That I'm seeing what I want to see?  That I'm protecting a murderer?  What? +++$+++ 1990s
Dartmouth +++$+++ 1990s
Yes, of course. My concern is to protect you from any suspicion of favouritism. +++$+++ 1980s
Yeah, some creep stole my cigarettes! +++$+++ 1970s
Cool it. We got business. +++$+++ 2000s
I'm frightfully sorry. There is a telephone in the Public House about a mile down the road. I suggest you use that. +++$+++ 1970s
I know, we'll be there soon. +++$+++ 2000s
Quitting time.  Grab a cold one? +++$+++ 1990s
Why don't you let at do that...? +++$+++ 1990s
Sh! +++$+++ 1980s
I'd be delighted to... anytime you can show me the doubt. I'll wrap it up in tissue paper and put a Christmas seals on it for her. +++$+++ 1990s
What is the Matrix? +++$+++ 1990s
"Then they'd put you in jail." +++$+++ 2000s
Or a vegetarian? +++$+++ 1990s
Lestat! You knew Lestat! +++$+++ 1990s
Shut up. +++$+++ 2000s
Richard, it's secret. That's the whole point. +++$+++ 2000s
Just one question.  Since Dr. Argon no longer has feeling below his waist, how is it that you're still able to do your job? +++$+++ 1990s
Well, they're gonna. It's time this gearjammer rode to glory.  Now, move aside; good buddy. I'm coming through. +++$+++ 1970s
Us seeing each other. +++$+++ 2000s
Why won't you kiss me when we're all alone ? +++$+++ 1990s
A man in love, completely shaken. He sits on bed, thinks, then takes telephone slowly, decisively. +++$+++ 1930s
We won't need it then. +++$+++ 1970s
Kate, Scott? +++$+++ 1990s
Aw, fuck. +++$+++ 2000s
Oh I love you. +++$+++ 1970s
Yeah. +++$+++ 1990s
That's never been proven +++$+++ 1990s
Well... there's still some cell activity... it's not entirely dead yet. +++$+++ 1980s
Causes sleep. +++$+++ 1990s
How's astronaut training? +++$+++ 1980s
No longer'n we can get acrost her. +++$+++ 1940s
It can be dealt with, but only if you want to.  I can help you. +++$+++ 1990s
Okay, I'll help you.  Should we make some dip or something? +++$+++ 1980s
Oh yeah, yeah I've driven by that place before. I seem to remember a crabby old bastard in a crummy clown suit running the place. +++$+++ 2000s
I played Richard III... +++$+++ 1990s
Not this again -- +++$+++ 2000s
Tell her I lied, that I didn't take advantage of her. +++$+++ 1960s
Skye!  I'm so glad you're able to make it...it's our sixth, actually.  You read the book again?  Well, no, the ending to chapter six...it's just that it's not filmic. We tried it in an earlier draft, but, it just wasn't filmic... Well, sure, we can absolutely look at that again.  If you're coming from Laurel, you want to take Sunset west, we're just past Will Rogers State Park.  Three blocks west of that, you want to hang right.  It's about three quarters of a mile up a big white thing on the left. +++$+++ 2000s
Why did you do this? +++$+++ 1990s
Why? +++$+++ 1990s
What? +++$+++ 1990s
Getting there. +++$+++ 1980s
What is <u>this</u>? +++$+++ 2000s
Hey, speaking of Wrong Place, Wrong Time.  Lewis Lane to the rescue! +++$+++ 2000s
Anybody with hair on his chest. Get 'em off the street -- anywhere. Offer them anything -- only get them.  We've got to get this desk out of here. +++$+++ 1940s
Sure you are.  And we're not help- ing her any, feeding her lies and more lies.  Getting herself ready for a pioture ...  What happens when she finds out? +++$+++ 1950s
They can have the Estate. +++$+++ 1930s
Yeah. +++$+++ 1990s
You look as if you could. +++$+++ 1970s
She'll do nothing of the kind! She's going to church with me, right away! +++$+++ 2000s
The man who bought them last week was American. I did not see him but I heard. I knew you would come. +++$+++ 1960s
That's what I'm saying. +++$+++ 1990s
In New York. +++$+++ 1930s
How can you hang out with Casper? He's such a jerk. +++$+++ 1990s
Good morning, sir. +++$+++ 1980s
Objection, your honor.  The answer is, to be generous, very vague. +++$+++ 1970s
I agree. +++$+++ 1990s
How do you get through those winters?  Well, you're right.  Juneau.  What's the highest peak? +++$+++ 1990s
I don't know. He moved away. +++$+++ 1980s
Pete, there's time before the picture starts, you want to get some popcorn? +++$+++ 2000s
Do you need a secretary? +++$+++ 1970s
You can always come see it in London. +++$+++ 1980s
He isn't. You're not cut out for this. You're just a guy that happened to find those vehicles. +++$+++ 2000s
Willie, come on! +++$+++ 1980s
Yes. He's more than four thousand years old and still decomposing. +++$+++ 1990s
It is nine p.m.  Pleasant dreams. +++$+++ 1990s

Vaughan's "friend" will be there, too. He works at the funeral home. And Frank. You know Frank likes you a lot. He says you make him feel calm. +++$+++ 1990s
IT WASN'T A TV SHOW!  IT WAS REAL! +++$+++ 1990s
Not bad, not bad. In fact, uh, my wife's pregnant again. +++$+++ 1990s
Who is Machine? +++$+++ 1990s
Can't -- can't you -- Couldn't you come too -- I think it would be better -- for us -- for us both. +++$+++ 1930s
Blow yourself, bigmouth. +++$+++ 1990s
I take it you don't like Miss Lawson very much? +++$+++ 1990s
I don't see anything! +++$+++ 1990s
-- But it's Sunday. +++$+++ 1990s
When I was first married. +++$+++ 1990s
I've been very lazy for a long, long time. +++$+++ 2000s
She's right, Norbert--go home. WOODLY I haven't said all I have to say. +++$+++ 1970s
Sherry   Sherry  Sheerrry. ... +++$+++ 1990s
Wait a minute, sonny.  I think you better come with me. +++$+++ 1970s
Since you were a child? +++$+++ 1970s
Now, children, no fighting -- save that for the office. Let's have our dance. +++$+++ 1930s
What's any of that got to do with Paul D.? +++$+++ 1990s
Let's not talk about that. How'd you get home? +++$+++ 1990s
Two officers have been assigned to the case. I can't keep them on indefinitely, but we'll go through every lead. +++$+++ 1970s
That's unique. +++$+++ 2000s
Sir, I'm flattered that you even recognize my name. My God, I had no idea you were in Hollywood. +++$+++ 1990s
Why. +++$+++ 1980s
You were right -- and I was wrong. There!  Did you ever think you'd hear me say that?  Spectacularly wrong. Instead of observing those animals, I tried to control them.  I squandered an opportunity and we still know next to nothing about their lives.  Not their lives as man would have them, behind electric fences, but in the wild.  Behavior in their natural habitat, the impossible dream of any paleontologist.  I could have had it, but I let it slip away.  Thank God for Site B. +++$+++ 1990s
I have a professional relationship with Rachel Banks. She's the go- between for a private investigator I use. +++$+++ 1990s
You weren't mad at him for picking up the phone? +++$+++ 1990s
It's all right, George.  It's cool. Just wait here, all right?  I'll be back in a coupla minutes. +++$+++ 1980s
What about the game?! +++$+++ 1990s
Maybe you should have just a half. +++$+++ 1990s
Everybody else is buying the minor stroke'  story... +++$+++ 1990s
What? +++$+++ 1950s
You wanna go downtown and discuss this officially? +++$+++ 1990s
I didn't see you there. Can I help you? +++$+++ 1990s
I hear he didn't mean to.  The cop fell as Dillinger was aiming at his leg and got him through the heart. +++$+++ 1990s
Yeah.  But not for long. +++$+++ 1990s
Not too far, I hope. +++$+++ 1990s

Cut it out, will you? Just cut it out and come back here. +++$+++ 1990s
Hey, Ros, where are they? +++$+++ 2000s
What is it this time? +++$+++ 1990s
Hell, they hardly even noticed us. +++$+++ 2000s
Oh, you... +++$+++ 2000s
... Whew!  I'm glad that's over with. +++$+++ 1970s
Here's one! +++$+++ 1970s
I'm not hungry. I can't eat nothin', I haven't been able to eat since I got fired. I think maybe I'm sick. +++$+++ 1990s
I found sand. I saw death. +++$+++ 1990s
Aye, let's try the dressing room. +++$+++ 1960s
Do your job, man, don't tell me to dance. +++$+++ 1990s
Do you remember where it is? +++$+++ 2000s
Like I had a choice with that anal-retentive Jon Archer rising my ass at the probation hearing.  At least he took an interest. You took off without leaving so much as a Post-it. +++$+++ 1990s
Is that what you want to do? +++$+++ 1940s
I said no touching. +++$+++ 2000s
Big threat. TV would ream you. +++$+++ 1970s
That's what I would have done. +++$+++ 2000s
I didn't say nothin', Boss. +++$+++ 1960s
-please- you needn't be so graphic- +++$+++ 1990s
That sudden? +++$+++ 1960s
Yes. I'm all over that now. Jack, hold on a minute. There's someone here who wants to talk to you... +++$+++ 1990s
Was it <u>every</u> day or just semi- weekly you got your ass kicked as a kid? +++$+++ 2000s
And I... love you... +++$+++ 1980s
And they will be again, Spock. That's the beauty of it.  How much? +++$+++ 1980s
Jesus.  Well, I do too, sometimes... +++$+++ 1990s

Shut up.  I don't feel like dying today. +++$+++ 2000s
Gus, Webco, the Webster industrial complex, is a family-owned cartel. A little magnesium here, a little zinc there. Some railroads here, some farm machinery there. You follow? +++$+++ 1980s
It's not that simple. You have to be careful. There's another guy that comes along, a hard-on you owe some money to. A mob guy. Wants to take you out anyway, on account of a past situation. +++$+++ 1990s
Of course. +++$+++ 1990s
All right, all right!  Hope you figure this out, folks. +++$+++ 1960s
Yes -- what is it? +++$+++ 1990s
Yeah, you bet! +++$+++ 1940s
Doctor, what's wrong? +++$+++ 1960s
I love you! 1 want to marry you! +++$+++ 1990s
No. +++$+++ 2000s
You mean that leaves Miss Hall. +++$+++ 2000s
Hey ninety five point three percent of all murders are committed by either a spouse, a direct relative or a close friend that's common knowledge. But this wasn't murder it was an accident- +++$+++ 2000s
Take your boots off.  You're tan. +++$+++ 2000s
Yes, I know. My first concern is to locate the lucky man. When I do, it's your job to keep the newspapers away from him. +++$+++ 1930s
Are the labs in operation? +++$+++ 2000s
What do I tell them? +++$+++ 2000s
Well, let's see -- there was that moment, when I had a train on top of my head -- +++$+++ 2000s
I don't believe you, Eddie. I think you're still a loser. +++$+++ 1960s
I've been doing nothing I shouldn't, sir. The millicents have nothing on me, brother, sir, I mean. Deltoid pulls Alex down on the bed. +++$+++ 1970s
Honey, she won't d... +++$+++ 1990s
No! Don't! Please! +++$+++ 1970s
I can subpoena you, you know.  I can get you up there on the stand. +++$+++ 1970s

How the hell should I know how much? +++$+++ 1990s
Sonny...Sonny--Jesus Christ, I'm down at the hospital.  I came down late.  There's no one here.  None of Tessio's people--no detectives, no one.  The old man is completely unprotected. +++$+++ 1970s
God yes, Allie. I've gotta say -- that was the ballsiest move I ever... +++$+++ 1980s
What are you <u>doing</u> here? +++$+++ 1990s
Oh, I studied the guitar. I had to give it up. Gave me calluses on my fingers. As an actress I can't afford to have a tarnished instrument. +++$+++ 1970s
You mean it's a girls' band? +++$+++ 1950s
Aye. +++$+++ 1990s
Okay, let's drop it.  I didn't mean I'd take a test for you -- I mean if that came up in conversation I'd... +++$+++ 1980s
Hello, Claire.  How extraordinary that you came. +++$+++ 1980s
Of course. +++$+++ 1990s

You didn't even open my present and I'm your daughter. +++$+++ 1940s
I think about you. I mean, a lot. +++$+++ 1990s
Terrible! Nothing terrible about her. She's great! Marvelous youngster! Got a mind of her own. Knows just what she wants.  She's not going to get it though. She won't get very far. Has no money. +++$+++ 1930s
What do they do that they had to kill her? +++$+++ 2000s
Sorry, didn't mean to -- +++$+++ 1990s
Oh. My. God. I can't believe you're here. Welcome. Can I just tell you, I am so excited right now. +++$+++ 2000s
Coughing opens up the capillaries. When you cough, you're getting air -- in this case smoke -- to parts of the lung that don't normally get used. Coughing's good -- gets ya higher. My dad coughs when he smokes all the time. +++$+++ 1990s
That's right. +++$+++ 1980s
I'm telling you. Wait three days... +++$+++ 1990s
Let's synchronize the watches. Eleven forty-two, sharp. +++$+++ 1950s
Three minutes. +++$+++ 1980s
Come and get you! Shit! It's a damn half hour drive each way. Why didn't you talk to me about it first? +++$+++ 1990s
Absolutely. +++$+++ 1970s
She said she was in Arizona, did she? +++$+++ 2000s
Twenty years of counselling you see a lot of-- +++$+++ 1990s
Well, I can't, sweetheart. +++$+++ 1990s
What's the big idea, Sefton? Take that telescope out of here. +++$+++ 1950s

...Aren't you skating? +++$+++ 1970s
Please yourself. +++$+++ 1980s
But I'm a robber and a manslaughterer and I haven't had any parental guidance. +++$+++ 1990s
As a matter of fact he does. +++$+++ 1990s
No. When I say the word "pretty," when I say the word "pleasure," what is the earliest memory you see? +++$+++ 2000s
I don't know. We'll figure it out. +++$+++ 1990s
Oh, Brother, I am so disappointed in you. You mustn't look at those horrible things, they degrade the human image. +++$+++ 1990s

No, no.  That won't do. +++$+++ 1980s
I don't know... too late to stop it. +++$+++ 1980s
Because when we get down there -- +++$+++ 1990s
What'the fuck is that? +++$+++ 1990s
What I mean is ... Mary Sue's been a little "different" lately ... +++$+++ 1990s
You're a fucking dead man-- +++$+++ 1990s
Oh, thankyou, your honour. The Tramp takes a second look at Alex. +++$+++ 1970s

It's a very moving experience, trust me. +++$+++ 2000s
No, no, no, no, no, no. Wait. +++$+++ 1990s
You know that if you come, we gotta invite Maranzano. +++$+++ 1990s
No, I wouldn't be surprised at anything from you. Winningly. MAXWELL Now, honey--you are here in time to help me and you can-- +++$+++ 1980s
I've had many... when the sea doesn't want you. +++$+++ 1980s
Just a visit with my old pal, Jay-bird. +++$+++ 2000s
Ambassador, I -- I had no idea you were here...  I think you know my crew... +++$+++ 1980s
Put me down, you son of a bitch! +++$+++ 1990s
Well, I thought it was safe-- +++$+++ 1980s

And you have no idea where he lives? +++$+++ 1990s
Anything else I can get you? +++$+++ 2000s
Felt a little light. +++$+++ 2000s
So you felt it too! +++$+++ 1990s

But Al is your husband now! +++$+++ 1990s

Do you know what's in this archive? +++$+++ 2000s
Johnny! +++$+++ 1950s
Mrs.  Otto,  there is no such thing as an accident.  The word doesn't mean anything to me.  As far as I'm concerned, somebody somewhere made a decision to cut a corner.  Some corrupt agency or corporation accounted the cost variance between a ten-cent bolt and a million dollar out-of-court settlement.  They decided to sacrifice a few lives for the difference.  That's what's done, Mrs. Otto.  I've seen it happen so many times before. +++$+++ 1990s
Okay.  So I had this...thought, and...this may seem like it's out of left field, and I don't know if you can, but since I'm not going with anyone -- +++$+++ 1990s
No.  Right here on the beach.  Come on. Let's do it. +++$+++ 2000s

Yes? +++$+++ 1990s
Up all night again, huh? +++$+++ 1990s
What the hell do you think's the matter.  I could wait for you someplace. +++$+++ 1970s
You've been avoiding me. +++$+++ 1990s
Uh, his birthday, uh, May.  I think. +++$+++ 1990s
Go learn something. +++$+++ 2000s
Actually, no. Adam was switching to a Whole Life Policy, but re-scheduled his medical exam...and failed to make his last payment...so his Term Life lapsed. So it's value is null and void.  Now he did have a pension account, worth another 150 thousand. +++$+++ 1990s

I'm sorry.  If there was any other- +++$+++ 1990s
When I was a little girl.  Three or four. If I had a nightmare, I'd bring my Dad in. The dream would always get better.  He always used to tell me about it the next day -- he used to think they were his dreams. NANCY When did it stop? +++$+++ 1980s
Not really. I'd say that Gordon is one of the most astute collectors around. He has a great eye and he only buys the best. Like this rug for instance, a silk Tabriz, the finest of its kind. The day after he bought it in London, a dealer representing the Saudi Royal Family offered him twice what he paid. It absolutely makes the room. See how this little bit of celadon in the border is picked up in the cushions oh the sofa... although...  I don't know if I would have used that tea dipped linen for the upholstery - too dingy. And it's a sacrilege having that Pre-Columbian pot in the center of the coffee table. Some dope might use it as an ashtray. +++$+++ 1980s
You listen to me, someday you might say, "Hey..." No, fuck that, you just listen what I'm going to say: your partner depends on you.  Your partner...a man who's your "partner" depends on you...you have to go with him and for him...or you're shit, you're shit, you can't exist alone... +++$+++ 1990s
I went. I did. I took my mother and little brother. +++$+++ 1990s

Zeena... +++$+++ 2000s
John... +++$+++ 1990s
Yeah, I can see that.  I guess the only thing that confused me is - - not that your medical problems aren't important, but -- how come the files about them are in with all the real estate stuff? +++$+++ 2000s
You wanna drink? +++$+++ 1960s
Sort of like a new hobby, huh, General? +++$+++ 1960s
At least I can explain that, Mary. Your sister had a feeling about life —— that it wasn't worth living unless one could end it. I helped her get that room. +++$+++ 1940s
Shut up.  West's dead. +++$+++ 2000s
I was stoned. That's why they stopped me. When I'm not stoned, I got no place else to go. They just protect me from myself. +++$+++ 1970s
A cure? +++$+++ 1990s
You need to get better first Trevor. Way better.  It's okay to miss somebody. It's okay to still love someone after they're gone. But you've got to quit blaming yourself okay...? Okay? +++$+++ 2000s
I'm not playin' myself no mo'. +++$+++ 2000s
Well, sounds like me. Sorry, man.  Says you were jealous and suspicious. +++$+++ 2000s

For trying to impose some decency on that sort. +++$+++ 2000s
I must speak to you, Miss Flaemm -- business. +++$+++ 1930s
You do what you want. You want to leave... You want to go kill yourself? +++$+++ 1980s
So my associate Mr. Marco tells me you may be interested in investing in a motion picture. +++$+++ 1990s
Probably you're right, but a little while ago, I was talking to a couple of lawyers who'd been assigned to represent the burglars. +++$+++ 1970s

I'm not going to say anything -- to Marge, or anybody, the police -- It's a secret between us and I'll keep it. +++$+++ 1990s
Stop tearing me apart!  You say one thing and he says another and then everybody changes back-- +++$+++ 1950s
Out getting coffee. +++$+++ 1990s
Who cares?!  You hired an actor?? +++$+++ 1990s
A paper? +++$+++ 2000s
Everybody's good-looking, Patrick. +++$+++ 2000s
Sister, we all know what happened to you yesterday morning. I expected that you would want to speak to me about it. But you could have come to my office. Your being here, in the confessional, implies that you, Sister, have done something wrong. You haven't. I assure you. I feared you might have misplaced feelings of guilt. If you condemn yourself because you experienced feelings of... curiosity or even... pleasure, you mustn't -- +++$+++ 1990s
They can look forward to that. +++$+++ 1990s
She's on the North Head Bluff - approaching the cliffs.  One klick away. +++$+++ 2000s
Your compliment was sufficient Luis. +++$+++ 2000s
No. +++$+++ 1980s
You are an imperfect being... created by an imperfect being. Finding your weakness is only a matter of time. +++$+++ 1990s
I figured I'd ask you... +++$+++ 1980s
This is Lila Crane, from Phoenix. She's been here for a few days, looking for her sister. There's a private detective helping... and, well, we got a call tonight, from this detective, saying he'd traced Mary... +++$+++ 1960s
You see, a tree is a living thing. +++$+++ 1980s
Car trouble? +++$+++ 1980s
Sir, you haven't logged a single star hour in two and a half years. That, plus your unfamiliarity with the ship's design -- in my opinion, sir, seriously jeopardizes our mission. +++$+++ 1970s
There's something in Constantinople... something irresistible.... +++$+++ 1930s
Reckon we better begin roustin' 'em out if we aim to get outa here by daylight. How about it, John? How you boys comin'? +++$+++ 1940s
Minnie Pearl. +++$+++ 1990s
When do you need it? +++$+++ 1980s
I still don't either, even after all these years. +++$+++ 2000s
Okay. +++$+++ 1980s
This is all terribly wrong. +++$+++ 1960s
He won't make love to me anymore. +++$+++ 1980s
The Vatican is made of constant mysteries meant to be enjoyed, not explained. +++$+++ 1990s
Sure you are, sport. +++$+++ 2000s
I've studied the case file, have you...? Everything you need to find him is right in these pages. Whatever his name is. +++$+++ 1990s
We met on the beach. +++$+++ 1980s
Make sure you're here by noon - we have tons of stuff to do... Oh yeah! I have to show you something else! +++$+++ 2000s
Well, you didn't appreciate the severity of it until recently.  No question about that. +++$+++ 2000s
Hide us Uncle Birdie! He's a-comin' with his knife! +++$+++ 1950s
Yeah, sure... very funny.... +++$+++ 2000s
You make it sound like a prison sentence. +++$+++ 1990s
Nothing R, okay? +++$+++ 2000s
Never mind.  Do they have that knowledge? +++$+++ 1980s
Yeah, intensive care ward.  My God-hey, Max, I think she's... I think she's giving me the eye. +++$+++ 1970s
Will you stop and tell me what's wrong? +++$+++ 1980s
Put it in your pants. +++$+++ 1990s
Castor's escaped! +++$+++ 1990s
Telly. +++$+++ 1990s
It's also the major piece of evidence, and it makes you a key part of his plan.  You can't run away from it anymore.  Look at the order he's doing them... He did three as the Boston Strangler just to tell us a copycat serial killer was at work.  Then he did one like the Hillside Strang- ler.  And then one as Son of Sam. To lead us on -- to where and what end?  And he's doing more than that -- he's imitating each killer's method as closely as he can -- in details.  Injecting Windex.  Using .44.  Playing Abba. +++$+++ 1990s
The legend goes that you release the power with the power. +++$+++ 1990s
Please, God.  Let this be it. +++$+++ 1990s
I saw him on T.V.  Some kid got possessed and he saved the little bastard's life. +++$+++ 1990s
I don't know.  I'll go and sort it out today. Why don't you come?... We'll find a real room for me. You can pick it out, a tower on the strip. +++$+++ 1990s
We were friends. I trusted him. I should have known it was weird. But, then again I was weird. +++$+++ 2000s
Yeah, my dad's great.  He took me to the zoo. +++$+++ 1990s
Dunn. +++$+++ 1980s
Five hours.  We both just know.  Do you think I deserve to wear white? +++$+++ 1980s
I'm sorry sir, we need your debit card before we can issue a credit -- +++$+++ 1920s
Her phone's probably tapped. +++$+++ 1990s
Jake, I mean, come on -- +++$+++ 2000s
Really? +++$+++ 1990s
What are you doing? +++$+++ 2000s
Goodnight. +++$+++ 1960s
There's more! +++$+++ 1990s
Maybe you better have a Black Russian. +++$+++ 1980s
There were 24 kidnappings in Mexico City in the last six days. Four a day. What do you think about that, Mr. Creasy? +++$+++ 2000s
He stole the contract knowing that I would come after him. +++$+++ 1990s
So all of our intel was bogus to begin with. +++$+++ 2000s
Rizzo, he's out there. +++$+++ 2000s
No. No, you definitely cannot do that, Mark. That's a big, fat sack of no! +++$+++ 2000s
Probably best not tell anyone about this. +++$+++ 1990s
You'd look naked without one. +++$+++ 1980s
We checked the manifest. Everyone was accounted for. +++$+++ 1990s
STOP IT! I DID SO KILL THEM! And I'm going to kill Anastasia. +++$+++ 1990s
What. +++$+++ 1990s
And I ain't no nigger either! +++$+++ 1990s
What are you doing here!? +++$+++ 1990s
Who? +++$+++ 1980s
He didn't join them. They joined him. +++$+++ 1980s
You're good enough you'll never have to kill anyone.  I joined the cops to save lives, not waste them. +++$+++ 1990s
Tha's your problem. +++$+++ 1970s
Why not? ... Oh wow, she doesn't know you're here. In fact, you're grounded. Jesus, you could get in a shitload of trouble for this. I think I should call her anyway. +++$+++ 1990s
Yeah. +++$+++ 1970s
Correct me if I'm wrong - WE! Because when I'm out on this very slippery limb for you, you have to know what's involved. +++$+++ 1950s
Try the spicy tuna hand roll. +++$+++ 1990s
Sir, how about souvenirs? +++$+++ 1970s
It's actually a very beautiful thing, and look there wouldn't have been a Vada. +++$+++ 1990s
Goddamnit!  D'you tell him we need it right now? +++$+++ 1980s
Once he locked himself in the bathroom and your grandfather had to get the ladder and climb in through the window.... +++$+++ 1980s
Well, you're gonna have to take your best shot. +++$+++ 1980s
Shit, shit, shit, shit, shit. +++$+++ 1990s
Will Senator Smith yield to--? +++$+++ 1930s
But what is this -- why? +++$+++ 1970s
Your lip bleeding? +++$+++ 1990s
You missed him! +++$+++ 1980s
No, actually I was thinking of becoming a brain surgeon. +++$+++ 1970s
Uh-huh. Some beat, huh? +++$+++ 2000s
We get to the bridge, we're all right! +++$+++ 2000s
Mmmmnph...I'll get you a cab... +++$+++ 1970s
Oh yeah. What about those other people? Anything? +++$+++ 1980s
Thank you.  I appreciate it.  I can't reciprocate. +++$+++ 2000s
Say not here!  Cuba! +++$+++ 1990s
My notes.  Observations.  Clues. +++$+++ 1990s
Yes.  How did you know? +++$+++ 1990s
You might be the only one with a job. +++$+++ 2000s
Have you got a pen? +++$+++ 1990s
Christ! You do know it all! +++$+++ 1980s
The coppers blamed me for everything that went wrong out here, and I mean every little fuckin' thing too. +++$+++ 1990s
Oh, I'm fine.  They've replaced you with quite an entourage.  It's a regular "marching band".  You should see me on the street, you'd think I was the First Lady -- +++$+++ 1980s
No!   Don't!  Lasher!!! +++$+++ 1990s
The bachelor party's upstairs. They made me get naked. They hung me from the window so high up it was so scary I fell down... +++$+++ 1980s
Mmm ... what are you doing? +++$+++ 1990s
-- By way of my breasts? +++$+++ 2000s
The Soul of the House. Everything that's corrupt about it... My father trapped it in there just before he died. You see, he purchased the house to restore it... We were going to live here... Nothing can live here. I was just a kid... The first time I saw it, I thought it was beautiful... It was just a dark mist turning into the corner of the room... then it started to move... then death started to happen... First the workers.. six in all... then my father... +++$+++ 1990s
Sure, anything you want. +++$+++ 1980s
So you did fuck up. +++$+++ 1990s
Where's Mary? +++$+++ 1940s
Ask him. +++$+++ 1990s
Michael, it sounds like a wonderful opportun... +++$+++ 1990s
Right. +++$+++ 1990s
And what do you mean barging in here and taking up my valuable time! I've got a company to run here -- +++$+++ 1990s
No. +++$+++ 1990s
Come on Mr. Parker. +++$+++ 1990s
SHOWGIRLS. Absolutely frightening. What's yours? Wait, let me guess. THE HOUSE ON SORORITY ROW? FINAL EXAM. GRADUATION DAY? THE DORM THAT DRIPPED BLOOD? SPLATTER UNIVERSITY? Am I close? +++$+++ 1990s
You've got to eat something. You're just nervous about going over to see if you're Diane Selwyn. +++$+++ 2000s
No. +++$+++ 1970s
No one. I promise. +++$+++ 1990s
No, sir.  I've never seen this guy before. +++$+++ 1990s
So lay it off to somebody else. +++$+++ 1990s
But of course. +++$+++ 1970s
I'm not a fool, Billy. +++$+++ 1990s
I don't know.  But as a scientist I have to consider that possibility. +++$+++ 1990s
Yes. +++$+++ 1980s
What?  How about a drink? +++$+++ 1990s
What do you want? +++$+++ 1980s
But, Doctor, surely in a case like this -- a child -- a little child who can never walk or run -- +++$+++ 1940s
Don't let your eyes go from the beginning of the sentence to the end like that.  You don't want to look shifty, do you? +++$+++ 1980s
What a sweet little picture.  Mommy and Daddy aren't losing a daughter, they're gaining a eunuch! +++$+++ 1990s
I know it's a dream. +++$+++ 2000s
Brad... +++$+++ 1970s
Must have taken a hell of a long time. +++$+++ 2000s
Where's the radio? +++$+++ 1980s
Only everything... +++$+++ 1970s
What do you mean? +++$+++ 1970s
Looks like a chipmunk. +++$+++ 2000s
...And for our young men on the field of battle, that they may return home to their dear ones... +++$+++ 1970s
You could. It'd be a waste of your time, though. +++$+++ 2000s
Oh yeah? How exciting. What's it called? +++$+++ 2000s
What do you expect me to do?  What in the world - +++$+++ 1940s
Who is it? +++$+++ 2000s
You just have to control it. We're not apes. +++$+++ 2000s
Have a great time, honey! +++$+++ 1990s
I hate to see you cringe in front of him.  How come you're so scared of your own kid brother? +++$+++ 1970s
I... I... +++$+++ 1980s
I don't know-like two-thirty, three. +++$+++ 1990s
No, he didn't. +++$+++ 1990s
Who is it? +++$+++ 1990s
Your love. +++$+++ 1980s
Let me tell you something about boys.  They're like weeds.  They grow best when they're ignored. +++$+++ 1980s
Sam, your life is going wrong - let your friends tell you - Records is a dead end department, no Security Level worth a damn, it's impossible to get noticed - +++$+++ 1980s
Don't you touch it. +++$+++ 1990s
You haven't heard from Rashid, have you? +++$+++ 1990s
A young Albanian Girl, dressed in their... +++$+++ 1990s
That's stupid. +++$+++ 1990s
Baldwin. The blushing bridegroom -- himself. +++$+++ 1940s
Could be meant as a warning. +++$+++ 2000s
No she's not. Don't you get it, ya lunk? She's using code language to the studio bosses. "Bedraggled foreigners and swarthy refugees" -- who the hell do you think she's talking about? +++$+++ 1990s
What's your story? +++$+++ 1970s
You know, this isn't gonna end well, these things never do. +++$+++ 1990s
You did? A human ear? +++$+++ 1980s
You're my hero, Carl. +++$+++ 1990s
Second verse! +++$+++ 2000s
A great warrior?  Not many on those.  Wars don't make one great. +++$+++ 1980s
I'm dizzy and thirsty. +++$+++ 2000s
I . . . can't . . . argue . . . +++$+++ 1970s
I'll be there in three days--four at the most. I've got to get the electricity shut off and square things with your school so the truant officer ain't after you, and-- +++$+++ 1980s
You haven't heard? Andy's dead. +++$+++ 1990s
If they think you're not trying, you're in trouble. First hint of that, they'll be on to the DSS, 'This cunt's no trying' and your Giro is fucking finished, right? +++$+++ 1990s
How much time? +++$+++ 1990s
If the Other Side ever gets hold of a thing like that... +++$+++ 1960s
Nothing has changed, I assure you both. The Army still thinks we got Elvis.  They had a tactical withdrawal.  It's just those two amateurs now.  Do you really want to concede a hundred million dollars to them? +++$+++ 1990s
Uh... Bob. Like to speak to you. Take a minute. +++$+++ 1980s
Can't remember the last time I saw you in that suit. +++$+++ 2000s
Where you at? +++$+++ 1990s
Forever together. +++$+++ 1990s
Enterprise would be unable to function <U>without</U> carbon units. +++$+++ 1970s
This is so unfair. +++$+++ 2000s
How did you know that? +++$+++ 1980s
Ben, I'm afraid I've got to ask -- +++$+++ 1990s
I can't even stand to talk to her on the phone. +++$+++ 1970s
You mean because What's-His-Name. +++$+++ 2000s
He'll replace you, too- that's all you really care about. +++$+++ 1990s
...a history of <u>nothing</u>, he was acquitted... +++$+++ 2000s
I'm not painting the fu --, I'm not painting the ashtray. And frogs aren't purple. +++$+++ 2000s
I got a kid, you know.  I'm a person, for Chrissake. +++$+++ 1990s
I've been hired as an independent contractor by the U.S. Resource Center for Missing Persons as part of an internal audit.  If you have any time over the next few days, I'd like to make an appointment to ask some questions about the disappearance of your daughter. +++$+++ 1990s
...easy, easy, easy. +++$+++ 1990s
I know, Dickson. That's all very well. But you're taking too many chances. In these times a bank should keep liquid in case of trouble. In case of emergency! +++$+++ 1930s
It's also called getting me this close to being murdered. +++$+++ 1980s
Come on tough guy. Listen to me.  You are going to tell Lois that it was all an accident. Okay cowboy? You got me? +++$+++ 1990s
She never particularly cared for me. +++$+++ 2000s
Meaning what? +++$+++ 1930s
Beam them directly to Sickbay. +++$+++ 1990s
To collect my fee. +++$+++ 1990s
How you doin'?  Hi there! +++$+++ 1960s
Sal, get 'em in the vault. +++$+++ 1970s
I was afraid of that. +++$+++ 1950s
Nigger. +++$+++ 2000s
...get 'em, he's going to start shooting hostages in five minutes... +++$+++ 1990s
... he'd just found out about Track 2. +++$+++ 1990s
Sure. +++$+++ 1970s
Alright.  We're going up. +++$+++ 1990s
It was a shame. +++$+++ 1990s
I'm sorry. +++$+++ 2000s
Guess that makes you pretty special. +++$+++ 2000s
What about us? What about me? +++$+++ 1990s
Mr. Appleton, I have reason to believe you're holding something back, and that just rubs me the wrong way.  Sir, are you a communist? +++$+++ 2000s
You really like that bitch don't you? I gotta tell you, I was pretty convinced that the whole thing before was blowing her off for her cut. You know how it is, get her to do some shit for you, throw her a bang to keep her happy. But, if you're into her... That's cool. +++$+++ 2000s
I dropped her at home. +++$+++ 2000s
Hey! He looks . . . normal. +++$+++ 1980s
... You know, Chauncey... I want us to be...  I want us... You and I to become... close... I want us to become very close, you know...? +++$+++ 1970s
Still, please. +++$+++ 1990s
Oh, all the great writers -- Shakespeare, Charles Dickens, Moby Dick... those people. Each is bound in genuine premium leather with 22 carat gold accents. It's a magnificent set -- and only $33.50 per volume. Right away you get Great Expectations for just $6.99. +++$+++ 1990s
It is easy to be sarcastic about religion. It is harder to take small hints from God, your feelings and listen to them... to take a stand. +++$+++ 1990s
Pleasure to meet you.  I've seen you on television. +++$+++ 1980s
I counted to three, honey. +++$+++ 2000s
Stop it, Jack. +++$+++ 1980s
Excuse me, Mr. Coccotti.  Do you know Nick Cardella? +++$+++ 1990s
I used to sing with male bands. But I can't afford it any more. +++$+++ 1950s
Hurry up -- the salad's getting warm and the pasta's getting cold. +++$+++ 1990s
Yeah. Just babies. +++$+++ 1930s
No, man, I'm doing okay. Thanks. +++$+++ 1990s
Well, he's in trouble and he didn't even get here yet. +++$+++ 1980s
But you haven't put in for emigration. +++$+++ 1980s
When it killed Sean it was like a stab in the heart.  I knew with absolute certainty that it had come for him. I knew that.  I know it's coming.... +++$+++ 1980s
Well, did you get a job out of it at least? +++$+++ 1970s
Say "goodnight" to Sandy. +++$+++ 1990s
Then let's go see what they missed. +++$+++ 2000s
We gotta get to Hector!! +++$+++ 1990s
Have they found my father? +++$+++ 1990s
Thought it was my week for that. +++$+++ 1990s
Did you see them? Did you see how they came? +++$+++ 1950s
What did you say? +++$+++ 2000s
OK...county tax records...they're saying 1490 Breckinridge is owned by... an Atlantic Trust Corporation...they have a P.O. box in D.C. +++$+++ 2000s
You are lately come to Scotland, Joseph? +++$+++ 1940s
Gone out with you. She woulda like rearranged your tonsils. +++$+++ 1990s
Shut up. +++$+++ 1990s
Well, then, what is it you exactly want to do? +++$+++ 1970s
Aren't you coming? +++$+++ 1990s
Come on. +++$+++ 1990s
I need help all right.  They're coming after me. +++$+++ 1990s
Huh? +++$+++ 1980s
I see you're playing your radio, Major. Isn't that contrary to my instructions for the personnel of this base? +++$+++ 1960s
Show some compassion. +++$+++ 1990s
Who I am, outside of this boat. What the hell I'm doing here. +++$+++ 1990s
We're very upset with her.  Get someone to <u>double for her</u>, her tits, the tits scene, call L.A.  I want to see some <u>pictures</u> of the women's <u>tits</u>.  Of their <u>tits</u>. +++$+++ 2000s
Can't eat through a canvas bag. +++$+++ 1990s
Hey, I'm glad you put truth in your song, man. That's important. +++$+++ 1990s
Then what are you saying? +++$+++ 2000s
I'm tired of dealing with peons.  I need to get to whoever's in charge. +++$+++ 1990s
You must take me for an imbecile. Why do you think I asked you to meet me in Washington?  I haven't spent five minutes in New York City without the company of a gendarme. +++$+++ 1970s
I killed him.  When I was 15.  He was my first.  Nah, wishful thinking.  Liver cancer. +++$+++ 2000s
Do you take risks? +++$+++ 1990s
What did you do with her? +++$+++ 1940s
Yes. +++$+++ 1970s
I'm sorry. Sam had to do a new crown, we had [?], and Jason had a sore throat.  Your big graduation, and no one was there. +++$+++ 1980s
Mr. Jung, do you know Diego Delgado? +++$+++ 2000s
How about capturing the kitchen and barricading the door? +++$+++ 1950s
If you want to call it that. +++$+++ 1970s
We'll follow you.  Take it slow,okay? +++$+++ 1980s
No. +++$+++ 1990s
Why do they read kids fairy tales in the first place?  Children are very impressionable, you know. +++$+++ 1990s
Did that help? Did you learn anything? +++$+++ 2000s
Now she was put in the nuthouse in 1930 at the age of 16. +++$+++ 2000s
The milkmaid's daughter? +++$+++ 1970s
Of course. +++$+++ 1990s
Yeah, we're all above that. +++$+++ 1990s
Yeah, exactly.  Those're pre-programmed course adjustments you're looking at. +++$+++ 1990s
Let's make more popcorn. +++$+++ 1970s
I mean, how can you go through life without never having made a prank call? +++$+++ 1990s
No problem. +++$+++ 2000s
Where to? +++$+++ 1970s
Okay, one of us sneaks in, gets four ticket stubs off some kids in the audience, comes back out, and we all "re-enter" the concerto. Voila! +++$+++ 1990s
Hi honey.  What's going on?					* +++$+++ 1990s
There you go again. Stop saying that. You can make it. +++$+++ 1980s
Originally, Connecticut. +++$+++ 1990s
Colonel Reed... +++$+++ 2000s
How could it be irresponsible, Sir, if you were the first man in the world to do it? +++$+++ 2000s
She had a... a hole in the palm of her hand!  She could have bled to death. +++$+++ 1980s
I... I'll get the grits. +++$+++ 1990s
I can't fly. I haven't got any wings. +++$+++ 1940s
Me? +++$+++ 1930s
You spend enough time down a man's throat, you get to know his tonsils. Do it ... +++$+++ 2000s
Roper, we're into it... +++$+++ 1990s
So attack is your defence. Well let's hope Cetshwayo will offer his Impis full destruction. +++$+++ 1970s
Are you serious? +++$+++ 2000s
You're not ready yet. They said two days. +++$+++ 1980s
"Don't write any checks you can't cash." +++$+++ 1990s
Anything to spare? +++$+++ 1960s
Something went wrong. System malfunction. Explosion. Mrs. Peel had a narrow escape. Suspected sabotage. Nothing proven. File still open. +++$+++ 1990s
Is it? Because of my mistake six men didn't return from that raid. +++$+++ 1980s
Noooo.... +++$+++ 1990s
Well he wasn't one of the Marx brothers, but he made me laugh. +++$+++ 1990s
If I did, I wouldn't come within fifty yards of your door. +++$+++ 2000s
This is Richter sir...I've got them pinned down. +++$+++ 1990s
I can't talk now. +++$+++ 1970s
I have a sore throat. +++$+++ 1970s
If I eat it I'll throw up. +++$+++ 1990s
It does indeed, Max. +++$+++ 2000s
You're not from L.A., huh? +++$+++ 1990s
Now you're talking. +++$+++ 1990s
You never thought of the possibility? +++$+++ 1990s
No, no, no.  You gotta listen to the way people talk.  See, you don't say like "Affirmative" or some shit like that.  You say... no problemo. +++$+++ 1990s
I saw Teresa. Maybe I was the last to see her except perhaps her Mamacita and her little brother. I was going past -- +++$+++ 1940s
Just come on, I've got an idea. +++$+++ 2000s
Every wire transfer gets rocketed through a series of multiple switches. As soon as each deposit lands somewhere, it's shot somewhere else. It ends up so clean the Mafia couldn't find it. +++$+++ 1990s
You talk as if— +++$+++ 1930s
How you doing back there? +++$+++ 2000s
Mark 20 Into the black hole,  areao. +++$+++ 1990s
Not so fast!  All trips are canceled. We pay for wire services. And what we don't get from them, we'll invent. +++$+++ 1980s
Sherry, Sherry... +++$+++ 2000s
Well, I don't think he's really been embarrassed by it. +++$+++ 1980s
Yes. +++$+++ 1970s
When he finds out. +++$+++ 1990s
Father, I was in the Army for awhile and every time they told us we were on a mission to save the world the only thing that changed was I lost a lot of friends. So thanks for the offer.. but no thanks. +++$+++ 1990s
Daskylus… +++$+++ 1990s
Why don't you start by saying "yes," and then getting me one of those swell pineapple kabobs. +++$+++ 1990s
Uh-uh.  Wait... +++$+++ 1980s
You could've killed us. +++$+++ 2000s
How? +++$+++ 2000s
Look, Mr. Roundy, why don't you make out a financial statement? It'll save us both some time. Miss Michaels here can show you... have it notarized and we'll see where we go from there. Miss Michaels, would you get me a couple of forms? +++$+++ 1970s
Dr. Soong must have found it unnecessary in later versions. +++$+++ 2000s
Mn-hm. +++$+++ 1990s
It wasn't 'till we got on the ground floor that I totally realized they weren't gonna shoot unless we shot first. When we got out of the stairwell, I remember thinking, 'Oh my God. This might work.' But Mickey knew it would work all along. There wasn't any doubt in his mind. It's not like there was and he just didn't show it. He knew it would work. +++$+++ 1990s
If the Japanese are pansies, then pansies are my kind of people. Sheila steps over to the booth with their food. The Buzz Burger has three holes cut in the middle to make it look like a bowling ball. Buzz sees the two sleazeballs park their car and walk towards the diner. +++$+++ 1990s
Hello? +++$+++ 2000s
That's it, we're empty ma'am ! +++$+++ 1990s
You ever been in this town before, to your knowledge? +++$+++ 2000s
They? +++$+++ 2000s
Yeah.  I better get on with my work. +++$+++ 1990s
I know.  People's movies aren't their lives. +++$+++ 1990s
It will take a lot of courage and backbone on the part of the CNS to get this on the air.  In fact, I would understand fully if the subject matter is deemed too risque, too controversial. +++$+++ 2000s
I would advise you not to interfere. +++$+++ 1940s
At the end of every chapter -- +++$+++ 1940s
Which brings me to rule number three: which says, fuck rules one and two, skip bail and take off. +++$+++ 2000s
All right.  Get a hold of yourself. Take a deep breath, let it out slowly and tell me who you are. +++$+++ 1960s
You see, Wilhelm, I'm talking about ordinary, everyday reasons. Which is why I want to discuss your private life.  How many illegitimate children do you have? +++$+++ 2000s
You'd think they've never seen a new toy before. +++$+++ 1990s
That was my first instinct too. Or D.W.I. Anything but this. And I'm going to punch that Bleeker kid in the weiner the next time I see him. +++$+++ 2000s
It is to us!  It's computerised. +++$+++ 1990s
Are they polar bears, too? +++$+++ 1990s
I don't even know you. +++$+++ 1970s
Single shots doesn't mean a fire fight. That's not a battle going on. +++$+++ 1990s
The next time you're in wild country like this, keep in touch with the British Consul. +++$+++ 1930s
You see how much you like her? +++$+++ 1960s
Who says so? I'm going to the morgue -- to look -- +++$+++ 1940s
I don't know.  Smile.  Sneeze. Something.  You've got a bag full of money and a ride to Paris.  Fuck it, I don't know...  What kind of music do you like? +++$+++ 2000s
What do you want?  Do I know you from somewhere? +++$+++ 1970s
Nothing. +++$+++ 2000s
It's only 11:00 here boys so I got lot's more drinkin' ta do with your worthless relatives down at the Anvil. +++$+++ 1990s
Forty-five minutes. +++$+++ 1990s
I don't know. I guess kids were hitting each other or something. +++$+++ 1990s
I thought you were going to stay with us for awhile? +++$+++ 1980s
Nobody. Accounting. +++$+++ 2000s
Now wait a minute-- +++$+++ 1990s
Do I make you horny? +++$+++ 1990s
Are you glad?  I'm glad. +++$+++ 2000s
Stop acting like you're someone special. You're just like the rest of us. +++$+++ 2000s
I don't know. +++$+++ 2000s
Yeah.  He lived there.  And died there, too. +++$+++ 2000s
Blue. +++$+++ 1970s
I see. You realize, however, that you committed a crime? +++$+++ 1940s
Too late, Honey. Fooled you. Done called him. He'll be here.  Or I'll go get him. Come on Karl, I need you to help me ice down a tub of beer, you and Frank. +++$+++ 1990s
Good idea - with a boss who's a really ugly son-of-a-bitch. +++$+++ 1990s
Smoke. +++$+++ 2000s
Mom doesn't like me to have them. +++$+++ 1970s
Just call me Barney. +++$+++ 1930s
Waring Hudsucker! Na-ha-ha-ha-ha! Say, buddy! +++$+++ 1990s
Why is that? +++$+++ 1980s
How're the cameras doing? +++$+++ 2000s
The white horse.  The horse that is going to greet me when he sees me. +++$+++ 1940s
We've only seen and talked to one suspect. He calls himself "Joe". There's two jewelers, two salespeople, the manager, a security guard, and an elderly woman. This particular store is where they do a lot of jewelry making and repair. They have anywhere from 8 to 10 million in raw stones on any given day, so they sure as shit didn't just wander in. They knew what they were coming for. +++$+++ 1990s
My mother -- she lives in Detroit. Come on now -- give me those stamps. +++$+++ 1960s
Okay.  I went after him.  I lost my temper. +++$+++ 1990s
True. +++$+++ 1990s
No, see, I want both of us to get crazy. We should both be cutting loose. I mean, this is our last chance. This is our week! It should be something we share. +++$+++ 2000s
Here! +++$+++ 1940s
I'm sure it is, Frank: and let me tell you something. If we find it so complex, how in the hell you think you're going to make a jury understand it?  See my point? Let's talk a minute. Frank: what will you and your client take right now this very minute to walk out of here and let this damn thing drop? +++$+++ 1980s
Her Highness' Equerry. +++$+++ 1990s
I like all of them -- +++$+++ 1970s
That cleaning woman doesn't... +++$+++ 1990s
No! I swear I don't know! Please! +++$+++ 1990s
I don't know why I come here every evening, it's always such bad news. +++$+++ 2000s
Okay.  Where to begin?  With your constant absenteeism?  With your unpresentable appearance?  You're up for review... +++$+++ 1990s
You go wait in the car. Wait a minute. +++$+++ 1990s
That's it.  My client doesn't have to take this crap from you. +++$+++ 1990s
Hey -- you called me... I... +++$+++ 1990s
Aw. +++$+++ 2000s
Long as Charlie says. +++$+++ 1990s
Yep.  There's some great places nearby. +++$+++ 2000s
Well, look here! +++$+++ 2000s
I'm just taking the poor girl under my wing. +++$+++ 1990s
I am sorry for you Mr. James.  I'm grieved to keep you or any gentleman waiting.  Had you not better to arrange with my doctor or get the cook to flavor my omelette with arsenic?  What are the odds, gentlemen, that I don't live to see Mr. James hang yet? +++$+++ 1970s
A long time ago... +++$+++ 2000s
She says she's on the rag every time I get called in to investigate a murder. +++$+++ 1980s
My shift ends at four, but I couldn't -- +++$+++ 2000s
Okay, boys, let's have it. +++$+++ 1990s
You'd probably have to go somewhere to really look into it. +++$+++ 1990s
Can't you please finish your drink? +++$+++ 1960s
Yeah, you already told me that. You cut that slice down to bite-size and maybe we can talk. +++$+++ 1960s
Oh, you think so?  Well, I've got news for you.  You've got Dracula's brother-in-law in there and he's got my girlfriend and her kid.  Around about midnight tonight, when you're partying uptown, this guy's going to come to life and start doing amateur head transplants.  And that's just round one. +++$+++ 1980s
You promised us real things -- a real... +++$+++ 1930s
What went wrong? +++$+++ 1980s
The car broke down. +++$+++ 1970s
What are you looking at? +++$+++ 1990s
I felt like it, so what? Goddam, you and Ann make such a big deal out of it. +++$+++ 1980s
I've got a little challenge for you, Sark -- a new recruit. He's a tough case, but I want him treated in the usual manner. Train him for the games... let him hope for a while... and blow him away. +++$+++ 1980s
He left.  I couldn't believe it-- he just left!  It's as if he's somewhere else... I'm only getting a piece of him. +++$+++ 2000s
Yes. +++$+++ 1970s
Aw come on, it was the only thing to do.  He knew he was holdin' ya back. +++$+++ 1970s
She still talking to you? +++$+++ 1980s
What virus are we talking about, Dad? +++$+++ 1990s
Yes sir. +++$+++ 1990s
Yes, we appreciate that. +++$+++ 2000s
You were set up, Lonnegan.  Shaw's been planning to beat your game for months.  He was just waiting for you to cheat him so he could clip ya. +++$+++ 1970s
Thank you, Jonah.  But the point is, I am not asking permission. +++$+++ 1990s
You want us to get ourselves killed? +++$+++ 2000s
Casharoonie! +++$+++ 1960s
Yes. +++$+++ 1990s
I'd go Special Reconnaissance. Every bit as tough -- and we have a 60 percent drop-out rate among the men. +++$+++ 1990s
Now you're talkin'. +++$+++ 1990s
What's he do? +++$+++ 1990s
Where are we do you think? +++$+++ 1980s
Won't?  Or can't? +++$+++ 1980s
Yeah, so? +++$+++ 1980s
A sign on him? +++$+++ 1990s
What did he have to do -— look at the body? +++$+++ 1940s
About eight o'clock. +++$+++ 1950s
Run! +++$+++ 2000s
Oh, yes. +++$+++ 1980s
To Bembry? Is Bembry your friend? +++$+++ 1990s
I'm only asking you to look at this, Doctor. Either you will or you won't. +++$+++ 1990s
Hardly a worry, sir. +++$+++ 1990s
She made me promise not to. +++$+++ 1980s
Mrs. Straub! +++$+++ 2000s
Bad breath?  Long fingernails? +++$+++ 1980s
I got that beat.  So like, last May, I was supposed to stay at this cheesy bed and breakfast in Pennsylvania. There was a major gas leak no one knew about and all the guests suffocated during the night. +++$+++ 2000s
I talked to some developers about the land. +++$+++ 1990s
Objection! +++$+++ 1970s
I think it started in the wind. Money - arms, big oil, Pentagon people, contractors, bankers, politicians like L.B.J. were committed to a war in Southeast Asia.  As early as '61 they knew Kennedy was going to change things... He was not going to war in Southeast Asia.  Who knows? Probably some boardroom or lunchroom somewhere - Houston, New York - hell, maybe Bonn, Germany... who knows, it's international now. +++$+++ 1990s
We could do that. I could be on my way to Florida, and you could go to Thailand and fuck your brains out. +++$+++ 2000s
It doesn't matter. Your life is hard enough. +++$+++ 2000s
I trust you. +++$+++ 2000s
And Lydia telling Natalie the truth makes you a victim in what way? +++$+++ 1990s
Ouch!! +++$+++ 1980s
You think I could make it to the Show as a manager? +++$+++ 1980s
You can’t go! +++$+++ 2000s
You're clear.  You see the airlock? +++$+++ 1990s
All right then, if I have to go to school then I'd better go. +++$+++ 1980s
Who are the other characters? +++$+++ 2000s
OW! +++$+++ 1990s
Yes...I'm uh...I'm fine. +++$+++ 1950s
Who the... +++$+++ 1990s
What are these? +++$+++ 1990s
You told me you weren't seeing her at <u>all</u>. +++$+++ 1990s
You mean the snake. +++$+++ 1980s
I'm about to get off the elevator -- +++$+++ 1990s
Hand it over.  Basic plot? +++$+++ 1990s
Can we order first? +++$+++ 1990s
Never ceases to amaze me. Fuckin' jungle bunny goes out there, slits some old woman's throat for twenty- five cents. Fuckin' nigger gets Doris Day as a parole officer. But a good fella like you gets stuck with a ball-bustin' prick. +++$+++ 1990s
Got to, Sam. You and I are going to a courthouse together, put some people behind bars. +++$+++ 1980s
What's going on? What happened to Stacks? Is everything okay? +++$+++ 1990s
Do you know what happened to her? +++$+++ 1990s
Do you love me? +++$+++ 1990s
I— I never knew a girl like you, Edie. I always knew the kind you just grab 'em And— I never knew a girl like you, Edie. +++$+++ 1950s
Don't you want dinner first? +++$+++ 1970s
What about the world? +++$+++ 2000s
...and your name goes through like seventeen computers a day. 1984, yeah right man, that's a typo. Orwell's here and now, he's living large. We have no names, man, no names. We are nameless. Can I score a fry? Thanks. +++$+++ 1990s
Looks to me like your out of business. Now I want some answers. +++$+++ 1980s
Sir? +++$+++ 1990s
I know he wasn't much of a father. +++$+++ 1960s
Did I?  Only 'cause my mom trained me to, with a man... any man, all men --  Corn dog! +++$+++ 1990s
We did a piece after your story ran in the New York Times. +++$+++ 1990s
Yes, I guess you are. +++$+++ 1990s
So are you. +++$+++ 2000s
Shut your mouth 'bout my Lucille. +++$+++ 1960s
Why do you have to rush off? What's so important in San Francisco? +++$+++ 1960s
Josh said... +++$+++ 2000s
That's right.  Gray, the cabman. I've had a bit of dealing with MacFarlane in the past, you know. +++$+++ 1940s
It's your best play, Nicky. +++$+++ 2000s
I don't know anything! +++$+++ 1980s
No. But you will.  It's very important that you live. +++$+++ 1980s
Teresa?...Yeah, Charlie.  Listen, I'm looking for your cousin.  Yeah, well today's Tuesday, payday.  I haven't seen him all day...no...well, have you got any idea where he is?  I know it's early yet but I'm just getting worried that's all... +++$+++ 1980s
He was my father. +++$+++ 1990s
Most of them invite me to sit in the cockpit...play with the levers and things. MAVERICK Well, get used to it. +++$+++ 1980s
Hi Vada. +++$+++ 1990s
Waiter! She needs more water. +++$+++ 1980s
Brief marriage!  Ten years! +++$+++ 1940s
The room has a bug in it. +++$+++ 1970s
Okay.  Talk some more. +++$+++ 1980s
We could've had three weeks in Florida - all expenses paid.  Lying around in the sun - palm trees - frying fish... +++$+++ 1950s
Guess I must've learned. +++$+++ 2000s
Look, Doctor! +++$+++ 1970s
She let it escape because she wants me to die. +++$+++ 1990s
Do it! +++$+++ 1990s
It's so late. +++$+++ 1980s
All the good ones go for jerks, you know that.  Forget her.  Take out your trig book and figure out problem twelve. +++$+++ 1980s
What do you think? +++$+++ 1990s
For Peter, that's a short trip. +++$+++ 1980s
Oh I don't know, I think the tests work pretty well. Sometimes they give me answers you wouldn't admit to in a million years. +++$+++ 2000s
Why don't you watch? +++$+++ 1960s
Your equipment has crapped out again.... +++$+++ 1980s
Dwarves be very sensitive about their feet. +++$+++ 1980s
Listen, there's things I can take and a couple things I can't and one of them I can't take, is when my older brother --  -- who is everything I want to be, starts losing faith in things. I saw your eyes last night.  I don't want to ever see your eyes like that again, okay? I'm serious. +++$+++ 2000s
Leak at the plant.  They had to shut her down. +++$+++ 1990s
You what... +++$+++ 2000s
Checking out a theory. Just keep talking to him. +++$+++ 2000s
Oh, no, sir. I've never had a woman do that. I'm sure she drowned. +++$+++ 1970s
And that's all he had to do.  Just show his face. +++$+++ 1970s
I'm happy too and we want you to be happy. +++$+++ 1990s
I was downtown looking for a ... a friend.  A guy I know.  Anyway, there was this store.  Like real old?  Lotsa weird shit in there.  I saw this statue. Pillar.  Thing.  I knew he'd love it. You've seen the club. +++$+++ 1990s
Hi, how are you? +++$+++ 1990s
Come with me, Susan.  I want to show you something. +++$+++ 1990s
Oh my God! Oh shit! Phuket Thailand! +++$+++ 2000s
You put my friend in the ground, with your mickeymouse <u>TaskForce</u>...  Izsat the kind of Headlines that Preserve and Promote, you, sir? +++$+++ 2000s
Then relax.  It's a federal bank. Guaranteed by the government.  And Senor Noriega has very lenient banking principles.  No questions.  No problems. All the pesados keep their money here. Even El Padrino.  What do you worry? Everyone knows we are with Escobar.  Who is going to fuck with us? +++$+++ 2000s
For being a bastard with no manners and not a dook of an idea how to comport yourself publicwise, O my Brother. +++$+++ 1970s
Oh, hello, perhaps you could help me.  I'm looking for an aerosol love potion I could spray on a certain Penthouse Pet that would make her unconditionally submit to an unusual personal request. +++$+++ 1980s
Go ahead. +++$+++ 1990s
What's this? +++$+++ 1990s
For as long as I can remember. +++$+++ 1970s
You'll figure it out and you'll do good by him. +++$+++ 2000s
Well that's not going to happen tonight. George said Carlton's a nice guy. +++$+++ 1980s
I seen your fucking face. +++$+++ 1990s
The sled as a shield.... +++$+++ 2000s
That's right. +++$+++ 1960s
Dad, I'm trying.  The chairs, they won't scrunch. +++$+++ 1990s
Oh, yes, the lads frequently gather round the T.V. set to watch her for a giggle. Once we even all sat down and wrote these letters saying how gear she was and all that rubbish. +++$+++ 1960s
You're at the Institute full time? Or do you have a job? +++$+++ 1970s
Sybok possessed the keenest intellect I have ever known. +++$+++ 1980s
But still died. +++$+++ 2000s
Of what? +++$+++ 2000s
You don't need to do that. +++$+++ 1950s
Cause I don't just stick my dick in anything. +++$+++ 2000s
Robot huh? +++$+++ 2000s
... First time in my life I'll be a voice with a body.  Do you know what that means?  What this could lead to? +++$+++ 1990s
Me? No. No, I guess not. +++$+++ 1990s
I didn't wait long.  One day I was going to Mass, like I do every day, when the same strange wind started blowing again... +++$+++ 2000s
Shh! Is that so hard to believe? +++$+++ 2000s
Come on in. What you been up to? +++$+++ 1990s
On screen. +++$+++ 1980s
She never told anyone else.  About the convict strain -- or is it stain?  No, I was privileged.  I was someone who helped Jenny efface her past. +++$+++ 1990s
