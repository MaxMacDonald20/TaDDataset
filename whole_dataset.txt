Or--since one is a well-known and respected guest--one could go to the desk in the lobby and say "Miss Mayfield seems to have lost her room key--have you another"?  They always have another. +++$+++ 1990s

I'm tired of bingo, maybe we should try that drive in of yours. +++$+++ 1990s
Hello. +++$+++ 1990s
I can't! +++$+++ 1990s
You put me in an awkward position, Mr. Kessler. +++$+++ 1980s
Obviously, the British government denies all of this - +++$+++ 1990s
I suppose you gotta get up early, huh? +++$+++ 1990s
What's my problem? You want a list? +++$+++ 1990s
You mean you don't want to go? +++$+++ 1930s
He was fine when he left here, and now look at him. +++$+++ 1980s
What? +++$+++ 1990s
Wuddya mean, buddy? +++$+++ 1990s
I asked, but ya never helped nothin'! -- Like the Bible sez, ya don't get no second chance. +++$+++ 1970s
Do you know what a wire transfer is? +++$+++ 2000s
No.  They hired Bain.  The contract would have been mine, but Bain took it from me as he took the previous one. +++$+++ 1990s
Did you kill Yankees? +++$+++ 2000s
What do you think... you are sixteen years old on Hollywood Boulevard? +++$+++ 1990s
...You know that car? +++$+++ 1980s
Thank you. +++$+++ 2000s
How am I supposed to not get excited, listening to you trying to extort your employee, you sarcastic prick? +++$+++ 2000s
You never know who you'll see. +++$+++ 2000s
A undercover cop has got to be Marlon Brando. To do this job you got to be a great actor. You got to be naturalistic. You got to be naturalistic as hell. If you ain't a great actor you're a bad actor, and bad acting is bullshit in this job. +++$+++ 1990s
You seem to be very satisfied to have taken me alive ... +++$+++ 1960s
It was once worn by Louis the Sixteenth. They call it Le Coeur de la Mer, the -- +++$+++ 1990s
You know what I'm saying, Joe? +++$+++ 1990s
Marty! It's me. Paul. +++$+++ 1990s
...I want all the names of all the other people he had with him. And I don't care what you have to do to him to get 'em. You understand? +++$+++ 1990s
How you doing down there? +++$+++ 1980s
I know I wasn't a good husband, Hildy, but you can always count on me. +++$+++ 1940s
Am I suppose to be this sore? +++$+++ 1990s
Admiral, I asked you a question. +++$+++ 2000s
Remember the guy who cheated at the table? +++$+++ 1990s
I came to see you. How you feel? +++$+++ 1950s
Great. I'll go with you. Wait a second. Hey, Raul! Move that car, will you? +++$+++ 1980s
What killed them I won't even write about. I tell you, they'd do more than just harass me. They have the future to protect. +++$+++ 1990s
Systems check positive.  Look, Elaine, I... +++$+++ 1980s
It's me. I'm just going to water the dragon... +++$+++ 1980s
Can I be of service, Miss Price? +++$+++ 1980s
Maybe the reason she's with me is a little thing called integrity, Sayer.  Look it up. +++$+++ 2010s
Like you said, maybe somebody's tracking one of your investigations. +++$+++ 1990s
Like a real sister? +++$+++ 1980s
And how about three hundred cigarettes for yourself? +++$+++ 1950s
I don't know. I told you, this isn't my apartment. +++$+++ 1990s
Anyone at home? +++$+++ 1960s
WISH HE WAS MINE.  THAT HANDSOME BOY OVER THERE, THE ONE WITH THE WAVY HAIR. +++$+++ 1990s
If he did, why didn't he use his damn shotgun? +++$+++ 1990s
Now, when we get out there, you do what we say or it's curtains. If we say move, you move. If we say left, you move left. If we say right, you move right. If we say mole, you dig a hole. Got it? +++$+++ 1990s
Pack your shit! We gotta get outta here! We gotta get out! +++$+++ 1990s
Nothing to be sorry about.  That's the way with men and women, isn't it? +++$+++ 1990s
That's it?  That's it? That's it? +++$+++ 2000s
Have you heard of Jonas Salk? +++$+++ 1990s
You have orange whips? +++$+++ 1990s
...but he wasn't the real Doctor Lizardo...just this arachtoid creep that stole the good doc's body the year before in the Eighth Dimension when Prof. Hikita's lab exploded... +++$+++ 1980s
I'm sorry.  Would you like a taste? +++$+++ 2000s
Suits. I didn't tell them anything. You know anything about gears? +++$+++ 1990s
Yes, you did. +++$+++ 1980s
The Manzetti thing must have scared her. She thinks she'll get implicated. +++$+++ 2000s
We gotta call the police – +++$+++ 1990s
You threaten me with my uncle? After what I'm doing for you? +++$+++ 1980s
What do you want to talk about? +++$+++ 2000s
M'hm. Yeah. Yeah. +++$+++ 1970s
Don't know. Really. I grew up with him.  I've missed him too, but now, every time I see him, I get confused. Hardly a day goes by he's not in my mind. Even now, I feel he's here -- +++$+++ 2000s
Why? +++$+++ 1970s
Thought you swore you'd never Carry that thing again. +++$+++ 1990s
Just listen to this—  Adorable Babykins— Does her miss her Baby? Him sends his booful li'l sweetums a billion oceans full of kisses. Bobo is so lonely—! +++$+++ 1930s
...Well, I have the worst  headache, I have to go find some aspirin. But, call me, let's have a drink, I'm under Evelyn Waugh. +++$+++ 2000s
I'm having some people over tonight for dinner -- I'd like you come. +++$+++ 1990s
Okay then.  I'll do it. +++$+++ 1990s
Of course, the check, I had it with me all the time. +++$+++ 1960s
Yes, sir -- I guess I do -- Gee -- +++$+++ 2000s
The exact words of the text. But do you understand it ? Do you believe it ? +++$+++ 1990s
Yes. I have to agree. From all you've found so far, his position's as good as yours. +++$+++ 2000s
The old Indian burial ground. +++$+++ 1990s
She'll say, "Now my son is a man." +++$+++ 1990s
So, uh, where are you in school? +++$+++ 1980s
You have to believe me, I had no idea -- +++$+++ 2000s
Well ... make him keep quiet. +++$+++ 2000s
He could have been a great man -- a good man and a fine doctor, but there was always the shame of the old life and the old ways to hold him back -- and always Gray -- Gray to hound him to his death. +++$+++ 1940s
I'm going to return the bracelet right now and face the consequences. +++$+++ 1930s
Oh, yeah, you gotta start making the list. +++$+++ 1990s
Repeat that, Bill. +++$+++ 1990s
And now that Superman's out of the Nice Guy business... +++$+++ 1980s
Well, are you? +++$+++ 1980s
Sure, sure, give go. +++$+++ 1990s
The code's changed. We need Artoo! +++$+++ 1980s
You mean it's just lying around someplace -- all that cash? +++$+++ 1960s
Aye -- yet one such as I who has wandered this world for nearly nine centuries can remember back to other days of change.  Days of Robin of the Hood and Arthur Pendragon.  They were real enough once, but they drifted into men's dreams and became legend - - as we shall do one day. +++$+++ 1990s
I want it back. +++$+++ 1980s
Go ahead. +++$+++ 1980s
You. +++$+++ 2000s
Just met her on the boat--supposed to play bridge with her yesterday--but she wouldn't--so we played poker instead. +++$+++ 1930s
Relax, this guy owes me a big one. A couple years ago he got in a jam up in the Boston office; some bullshit about padding his resume -- like we haven't all done that. Anyway, they were going to let him go but his mother wrote a tear-jerker letter that ended up on my desk. +++$+++ 1990s
Don't you want to come along, darling? +++$+++ 1950s
Ohh! +++$+++ 1930s
It's a knocking-shop. Tres discreet, huh? He visits his ladies on Tuesday and Thursday nights and Saturday mornings. His security's in the car beyond. +++$+++ 1990s
What, been drunk? Sure! Plenty! +++$+++ 1980s
Tish-I'm-tee. +++$+++ 1980s
We're going to draw a little bit of everybody's blood. +++$+++ 1980s
Well, it seems to me... +++$+++ 1990s
What is this? +++$+++ 1930s
He came by. +++$+++ 1990s
Paul, since you brought her up, I have to ask you this, or I'd be drummed out of the agents' union-- what about a non-fiction book? The truth about what went on in that house. +++$+++ 1990s
Get him in here. +++$+++ 1990s
I told you.  I don't turn on the TV except for the fights. +++$+++ 1990s
Well, that was a very promising start. By my calculations, you should be starting to feel alright again. Yes? Dr. Brodsky's pleased with you. Now tomorrow there'll be two sessions, of course, morning and afternoon. +++$+++ 1970s
You've just decided, is that right? +++$+++ 1990s
...I just made a call about that. It'll look fine. +++$+++ 1980s
When it comes to this, you is the real thing--is that what you sayin'? +++$+++ 1990s
Hamish, I... thank... +++$+++ 1990s
Listen you little Asshole, I oughta -- +++$+++ 1980s
We weren't there.  The handbook says funerals aren't for the dead. +++$+++ 1980s
Look at 'em! Same yella han'bill-- 800 pickers wanted. Awright, this man wants 800 men. So he prints up 5,000 a them han'bills an' maybe 20,000 people sees 'em. An' maybe two-three thousan' starts movin, wes' account a this han'bill. Two- three thousan' folks that's crazy with worry headin' out for 800 jobs! Does that make sense? +++$+++ 1940s
A big difference, if someone found it we should keep looking, if they didn't we're just wasting our time. +++$+++ 1990s
Shut up a second... +++$+++ 1980s
Captain Mertin? +++$+++ 1990s
Don't turn away! Look at it! You're in this too— don't you see, don't you see? You're in this too, Father. +++$+++ 1950s
Makes you cry +++$+++ 1970s
Brian, let me come to the point. I'd like to offer you a job. +++$+++ 1990s
These dang things are heavy. Hard to carry, too. +++$+++ 1990s
You name it. +++$+++ 1960s
He's just a deep sleeper. +++$+++ 1980s
The pleasure is all mine. +++$+++ 1930s
It's good advice...  Say hi to Marcia for me. +++$+++ 2000s
Because...there is good in him. I've felt it. He won't turn me over to the Emperor. I can save him. I can turn him back to the good side. I have to try. +++$+++ 1980s
Did one of the officers work you over a little? +++$+++ 1990s
Oh, well, I can't . . . +++$+++ 1940s
Oh God.  Oh God. +++$+++ 1990s
It's the only name I've got. How about you? +++$+++ 1960s
I'll say that I'm travelling. +++$+++ 1980s
That'd be fine.  So, Claudia, lemme just say, so I can get my role of LAPD officer out of the way before we enjoy our coffee  I'm not gonna write you up or anything, I'm not gonna give you a citation here -- but the real problem we have is that there are people around here, people that work from their homes, people tryin' to get some work done, and if you're listenin' to your music that loud:  They're incovenienced by that.  If you had a job you'd probably understand, but I see you like listenin' to your music and that's fine, you're just gonna wanna keep it down at a certain volume, maybe memorize what number you see on the dial and just always put it to that -- If it's the middle of the day -- that's what I do -- just put it on two and a half and that's a good listening level, alright? I see you like listenin' to your music loud, but, hey, forget about the neighbors, you end up damaging your own ears ok? +++$+++ 1990s
Forensics people are sure of it. You have any idea who might have put him there? +++$+++ 1990s
Yesterday, you were a loan shark. +++$+++ 1990s
I...don't think so. +++$+++ 1990s
If that's what feels right. +++$+++ 2000s
How certain are you that you haven't been sick in your life? +++$+++ 2000s
Ready? +++$+++ 1930s
Ummm, hmmm... umm, hmmm...  Well, this looks very good.. Of course  ... you understand this is the worst time of the year to look for a job. +++$+++ 1970s
Didn't you have something a little more romantic in mind for your first time? +++$+++ 2000s
What, you think there's something funny about it? +++$+++ 2000s
Shit! Temp's dropping! We should have left this rock an hour ago! +++$+++ 2000s
S'up. +++$+++ 2000s
This party is sick. +++$+++ 2000s
How about a lift home? +++$+++ 1990s
What rank?  I believe Corporal Hicks has authority here. +++$+++ 1980s
I don't want to talk about it. Everything's okay now. I don't want to talk about it. +++$+++ 1990s
That's not the way we play the game. +++$+++ 1990s
Look again. +++$+++ 1990s
Sounds good.  Kim, would you get Heather and me a coffee?  How you like it, Hon? +++$+++ 1990s
Self sufficient... +++$+++ 1990s
Yes. +++$+++ 2000s
What smells like shoe polish? +++$+++ 1990s
Oh?  What's the problem? +++$+++ 1990s
Okay, everyone. +++$+++ 1990s
And you were drilling these holes...? +++$+++ 1990s
... Oh. +++$+++ 1970s
You mean not enough to save you. +++$+++ 2000s
Which maneuver, sir? The one in which I moved an entire living room set from one lawn to another, or the one in which I cleared a sixty-four ounce blue slushie in ten minutes? +++$+++ 2000s
I never met them. +++$+++ 1970s
Please, Nancy. Trust us. +++$+++ 1980s
Did you howl off-key at the moon again? +++$+++ 1960s
Oh, no, you were- +++$+++ 1990s
That is enough!  You are a good servant, d'Artagnan, but you forget your place! +++$+++ 1990s
See, I wouldn't think that about you. +++$+++ 2000s
Dad'll pick you up today, all right? +++$+++ 1990s
I said no. +++$+++ 1980s
There's some sort of lock here. You say these thing's are made of granite with a steel interior? +++$+++ 1990s
You'll wreck your raincoat. +++$+++ 1960s
Uh-huh. You're a scream, Lovey. +++$+++ 1930s
You look very pale, Truman.  Are you taking your vitamin D's? +++$+++ 1990s
Oh no, no, it's... it's wonderful.   It's... no, don't worry about it.  You're very funny.  Go back, that's great! +++$+++ 1980s
What's the matter?! You mad at me? +++$+++ 1960s
Come on. I died enough for one night. +++$+++ 1980s
Pops +++$+++ 1990s
I can't...I can't answer you just because you want me to answer you! +++$+++ 2000s
We'll have to catch it and eject it from the ship. +++$+++ 1970s
I think she wants me to come over to put me into the right position to check out her delicates, what ever that means. +++$+++ 2000s
Dark Town. Land of nightmares. I'm Bull. +++$+++ 2000s
Why not? This place is dead anyway. +++$+++ 1990s
This is a neurelyser. it was a gift from some friends from out of town. I need you to look at it.  This red eye here isolates and measures the nature of the electronic impulses currently in your brain.  More specifically, the ones -for memory, which it will then block.   I said I need you to look right here. +++$+++ 1990s
No. +++$+++ 1980s
NO, YOU STOP IT! Stop pretending like you care! Like this really isn't about you and Tom. +++$+++ 1990s
Okay.  Why don't you go out there. We'll check in with you later. +++$+++ 1990s
It would be impossible to discuss the subject without a common frame of reference. +++$+++ 1980s
And I'm not even pretty. +++$+++ 1950s
I'm just here about my brother. +++$+++ 2000s
Who's this guy she's gonna marry? +++$+++ 1940s
What's goin' on? +++$+++ 1950s
No matter. There's nothing I can do about it. +++$+++ 1990s
He's on to a new thing. He's after a guy who owns a gun shop he says is "woefully and wantonly" selling assault rifles to minors. He says he's gonna take him down if it's the last thing he does. +++$+++ 1990s
It's already out. +++$+++ 1990s
What's in your socks? +++$+++ 1960s
I do? +++$+++ 2010s
Not where I come from. +++$+++ 1990s
Amateurs 2 +++$+++ 1990s
Is everything ok? +++$+++ 2000s
Eventually she married a young physician. +++$+++ 1940s
Not with us in the fuckin' car! +++$+++ 2000s
Just came by to wrap up over there. Thought I'd say "hello." +++$+++ 2000s
He's sulking again. +++$+++ 1960s
They look like a bunch of good ol' boys to me. I guess it's oil money, huh? +++$+++ 1990s
No, I wanna kill my boss! +++$+++ 2000s
Off limits. +++$+++ 2000s
Jesus Christ.  Can you kill it? +++$+++ 1990s
Three whole weeks. +++$+++ 1950s
Macey... I've never seen you like this. +++$+++ 1990s
No, nothing. +++$+++ 1980s
That's enough.  That's enough. +++$+++ 1980s
Enough of this. We stay together. Let me rest, I will feel better then. +++$+++ 2000s
Bill...This is hard on all of us and it's no time for compliments. But I think it's extraordinary of you to come down here for this. +++$+++ 1980s
The last Sankara Stone. +++$+++ 1980s
It's about the leopard. +++$+++ 1940s
What do I need a thief for? I've got the Mask. +++$+++ 1990s
Who? +++$+++ 1980s
I am not involved.  Keep clicking your little wires.  You'll get someone else.  Good luck. +++$+++ 2000s
I hope you're right... +++$+++ 2000s
Are you? +++$+++ 1980s
My mother can't have any more kids. +++$+++ 1990s
That ain't my scene. If that's somethin' you into... +++$+++ 2000s
Wait for what? +++$+++ 1960s
You really don't get it.  This story gets filed.  Every time anyone writes anything about me -- they'll dig up these photos.  Newspapers last forever. I'll regret this forever. +++$+++ 1990s
I think you're taking it seriously enough for both of us. +++$+++ 1990s
You're right. +++$+++ 1990s
What kind of a crash was it? +++$+++ 1990s
That's news to me.  So it's over at Jesse's office? +++$+++ 1990s
Ladies first.  I insist. +++$+++ 2000s
Yes sir. +++$+++ 1980s
Not much story here. Just a bunch of kids cutting loose. +++$+++ 1990s
Well, if you don't mind me sayin' so, he sounds like a real asshole. +++$+++ 1990s
What? What could he do? +++$+++ 2000s
*What* view? +++$+++ 1990s
I don't think I can wait until tomorrow. This needs clearing up. +++$+++ 1990s
I just thought if I gave you a drink and fed you some dinner, you'd be so grateful you'd take me to a movie. +++$+++ 1950s
I was just discussing this whole Vomit thing with my friend Art Mooney.  Do you know him? +++$+++ 1990s
God, I can't believe there are so many cool people at this party. +++$+++ 1990s
Hello, Mr Crane. +++$+++ 2000s
That one's probably married.  Think of his kids.  His wife's pregnant... +++$+++ 2000s
One, because I have a job here and two because I live here-- +++$+++ 1990s
Bud Fox, I look at a hundred ideas a day. I choose one. +++$+++ 1980s
Sir, I came from the Chicago offices myself, and if I may say, sir, there are still some very good.... +++$+++ 2000s
Well, it's for a woman. +++$+++ 1980s
Tea? Who wants tea? Let's go out! This calls for a feast. You don't want tea, Papa. Let's go dancing. Papa loves parties, don't you? +++$+++ 1980s
What happened that night? +++$+++ 1980s
You're really pissing me off. +++$+++ 1990s
Come now.  You've seen the graffiti -- all over the city in the few hors it has taken your men to drop like plague victims. What about your turf, Top?  You don't seem to have ripped out anyone's heart yet. +++$+++ 1990s
None that I've ever known. I know nothing of God or the Devil, I have never seen a vision nor learnt a secret that would damn or save my soul. And as far as I know, after four hundred years I am the oldest living vampire in the world. +++$+++ 1990s
Well, we're not in the middle of nowhere, but we can see it from here. +++$+++ 1990s
--my God, Nick??? +++$+++ 2000s
Detective Carter from the Haddonfield P.D. +++$+++ 1990s
Fuck this shit! +++$+++ 1980s
North, actually.  How'd you   ? +++$+++ 1990s
None shall pass. +++$+++ 1970s
Equipoise! Equipoise! What did I tell you, Animal? +++$+++ 1950s
Of what? +++$+++ 1990s
Good. I've always said you were wasting your time in the underwear department. +++$+++ 1950s
You're not telling me something. +++$+++ 1990s
Because I'm getting fat. +++$+++ 1980s
What do you care? +++$+++ 2000s
Twelve Young, answer the radio. I have a call for you. +++$+++ 1990s
You almost ended my career before it began. +++$+++ 2000s
Mrs. Leeds' fingernails and toenails. I think he took off his gloves, Jack.  And dust all the corneas of all their eyes. +++$+++ 1980s
But I am Barbara. I didn't die. +++$+++ 1940s
I'll be able to keep my apartment and studio, won't I?...  Just tell me. +++$+++ 1990s
Give it to me!  Yes! +++$+++ 1990s
He totally freaked.  I've never seen him like this.  He's out of his fucking mind. +++$+++ 1990s
We can hardly make a profit with them.  Up-front salary, back-end deal, perks, per diem, percentages -- They're mocking us, Elaine. We're at their mercy.  We always had movie stars but they used to be our stars.  We used to decide who would play what role. We told them what to wear, what to say, who to date.  When they were under contract, we could change their names if we wanted to -- more than once! +++$+++ 2010s
I need the main wet-wall. +++$+++ 1990s
No "buts." Go to your room now. +++$+++ 2000s
You my partner? +++$+++ 1990s
Yeah... +++$+++ 1970s
Call me Les. +++$+++ 1970s
No, Alfredo, I was coming to help you... +++$+++ 1980s
WALKED RIGHT INTO IT. +++$+++ 1980s
Well, don't go. +++$+++ 1970s
I went back to Watts to sell my old car and met her on the way.  Worst day of my life. +++$+++ 2000s
I was afraid that might happen. +++$+++ 1990s
Definitely. +++$+++ 1990s
What it was like when you died in the fire... +++$+++ 2000s
No. +++$+++ 2000s
You want to hit the town tonight? +++$+++ 1990s
What -- +++$+++ 2000s
"She was nice."  Wow.  That makes me all soft inside.  Ever occur to you she didn't love you back? +++$+++ 2000s
Let's go talk first, Adam. +++$+++ 1990s
Oh, man, you're not going to fall for that. +++$+++ 1990s
Okay, let's go in. +++$+++ 2000s
Christ! +++$+++ 1980s
Two:  There's nothing out there but noble gasses and carbon compounds and you'd be wasting your time. +++$+++ 1990s
What?! +++$+++ 2000s
Everybody makes their own fun.  F'you don't make it yourself, it ain't fun, it's entertainment. +++$+++ 2000s
So have we! +++$+++ 1940s
That's why Smith called you MacLeod. +++$+++ 1980s
And one of 'em is sick. +++$+++ 1940s
They were stained. +++$+++ 1980s
No -- Mama doesn't dream about you any more, Walter. You wouldn't know the old girl now. +++$+++ 1940s
But, Victor, if the situation were different, if I had to stay and there were only a visa for one, would you take it? +++$+++ 1940s
Damn it, Mom. I told you I need them all! +++$+++ 2000s
He was in love with me every day for nine years.  I can make him happier than she can. +++$+++ 1990s
Terri? +++$+++ 1990s
What?... Oh, right, you can see these guys too. Jesus... +++$+++ 1990s
What's that? +++$+++ 1980s
We're on. +++$+++ 2000s
I understand.  You're upset.  You want to know what's going on.  That's good. +++$+++ 2000s
-- we can go -- I can get us out of here -- but we have to go now -- +++$+++ 2000s
That's big of you, Bob. +++$+++ 1980s
Maybe you oughta give me lessons. +++$+++ 1960s
Straight-A brainiac! +++$+++ 1990s
Prevacid.  For my stomach. +++$+++ 2000s
Yeah, I've seen him. +++$+++ 1990s
She doesn't want to Bare Her Breasts. +++$+++ 2000s
Oh yes.  Why, you told me to sell them a long time ago. +++$+++ 1930s
That why you tried to put a bullet in my head in the middle of the desert. +++$+++ 1990s
Well, who is your lord? +++$+++ 1970s
You bet. +++$+++ 1980s
I think I could cobble something together.  A long metal rod with a battery in it.  Give it a hell of a shock. +++$+++ 1970s
Look at this!  "Hillside Strangler gets his college degree in prison!" +++$+++ 1990s
Have you got a license? +++$+++ 1930s
Now, that's American music. +++$+++ 1990s
Yes. I know. Still in the dumps, huh? +++$+++ 1930s
-- Yeah... your car down here? +++$+++ 1970s
Li Mu Bai giving up his sword and his warrior days... maybe he's trying to tell you something? +++$+++ 2000s
Clean. +++$+++ 1990s
Why sure, boy, sure. +++$+++ 1950s
The subject got emotionallv disturbed; he just dropped out. There's thousands. +++$+++ 1970s
Alex! +++$+++ 1990s
You believe that? +++$+++ 1990s
Forensic ballistics isn't an exact science, is it? +++$+++ 1980s
No, it's the whole idea behind it. How did they get this place? +++$+++ 2000s
Roger that. +++$+++ 2000s
Yes, ma'am. Are we the closest PD? +++$+++ 1990s
Hmm. +++$+++ 2000s
I believe I was successful in communicating our intentions. +++$+++ 1980s
Fresh guy, huh! What you need is a good sock on the nose. +++$+++ 1930s
We did not. +++$+++ 2000s
Well, I've been accused of many things, Mrs. Mulwray, but never that. +++$+++ 1970s
Unable to escape, she turns and attacks the killer, but doesn't connect. +++$+++ 1990s
Well, sure.  So would I.  So would you. I wouldn't worry about it.  We'll get it right one of these days. +++$+++ 1990s
Damnit to hell, you left me back there to die! +++$+++ 2000s
Good point.  Especially that dude you were with.  I'd like to see him down front. +++$+++ 1990s
Probably.  One of the many. +++$+++ 2000s
I've been trying to reach you but you haven't returned... +++$+++ 1990s
Hello, Exposition. +++$+++ 1990s
This is who you were. Exactly who you are is up to you. +++$+++ 1990s
Tonight and every night, my friend, for this is the second time you've saved my life.  I am Ergo the Magnificent, short in stature, tall in power, etcetera, etcetera. +++$+++ 1980s
I see. +++$+++ 1980s
A mortician.  He seemed to know a hell of a lot more about death than he ever told us. +++$+++ 2000s
What else's he goin to do with his day, he can't work, and he won't steal... +++$+++ 2000s
Thanks for coming to get us. Little brother almost scared us to death. +++$+++ 2000s
I think I can remember what's on them. +++$+++ 2000s
I don't give a damn about the money. I want you, and I want to get us out of this shithole.  There's only one way to do that. +++$+++ 1970s
-- we'll tell them what happened -- +++$+++ 2000s
He seemed like a nice guy, Alex. +++$+++ 1990s
Stay here?!  What's the matter with you, Bob? You've been acting strangely ever since we came here.  I've never seen you like this. Why can't we leave? What's stopping us? +++$+++ 1930s
Me, too.  I'm getting married tomorrow. +++$+++ 1990s
Allo... Salvatore... +++$+++ 1970s
A charming term.  Now, <u>why him</u>? +++$+++ 1990s
She did, huh. +++$+++ 1990s
Go on. Nothing can hurt you. Remember, this is only a movie. You're completely safe. +++$+++ 2000s
May I have some water? I'm thirsty. +++$+++ 1940s
I... +++$+++ 2000s
All right. +++$+++ 2000s
What's the trick here ? +++$+++ 2000s
I don't know. Who do you want? +++$+++ 2000s
But, Lily-- +++$+++ 1930s
What are you going to do about it, shoot me? +++$+++ 1990s
There.  And don't you dare tell me that wasn't a proper kiss! +++$+++ 2000s
Juice? +++$+++ 1990s
That's the point -- this could change things. +++$+++ 1990s
Get out of here. +++$+++ 2000s
He stuck it in the ball return machine when he was a kid. Crushed all the nerve endings. Junior starts stroking the ketchup bottle with his dead hand. +++$+++ 1990s
That's some nerve! +++$+++ 1950s
Lisa -- there's something terribly wrong. +++$+++ 1950s
Oh, I had the radio on. +++$+++ 1970s
Nothing. +++$+++ 2000s
Now.  Wait.  You didn't actually sign with Sugar, did you? Tell me you didn't sign.  Because I'm still sort of moved by your "my word is stronger'n oak" thing -- +++$+++ 1990s
All of the sudden, I'm feeling kind of nervous.  God, I hate blind dates.  Why couldn't we just have arranged marriages in America? +++$+++ 1990s
Anyway, Claire slept with him... +++$+++ 2000s
Nobody could attack you.  You set your life up like one of your chessboards. You're impregnable -- but at the same time you've become trapped behind your own defenses.  You're cut off from everyone around you. +++$+++ 1990s
We were in love but I'm not sure I know what love is anymore. +++$+++ 1980s
Billy... What the hell's wrong with you? +++$+++ 1980s
... You worried everything all right now and we'll have to go home? +++$+++ 1990s
It's twitching but it's below the line you said was safe. +++$+++ 1980s
Yeah... +++$+++ 1980s
It's the big potato. +++$+++ 2000s
He'll be back soon. +++$+++ 2000s
I didn't leave.  I was just digging around. +++$+++ 1990s
I talk to her or you can forget about it. +++$+++ 1990s
Well I'm going to major in Business Administration and, I think, minor in Communications. +++$+++ 2000s
Why don't you get it? He's going to kill us all! +++$+++ 2000s
At the seven-eleven. +++$+++ 1990s
I guess I've come to quite a place. +++$+++ 2000s
And what if they meet a monster in their dream? Then what? +++$+++ 1980s
Lynch him! Lynch him! +++$+++ 1950s
I don't know... +++$+++ 1990s
Whoops. +++$+++ 1980s
What was that, I didn't hear... +++$+++ 1970s
Tell me. +++$+++ 1990s
I tried him, he can't go.  His son is being Bar Mitzvohed tomorrow... I'll go, boss. +++$+++ 1980s
From now on, we'll share Marla. We've been spending too much time apart... +++$+++ 1990s
What's the matter with him. I never saw Nick act like that before. +++$+++ 1940s
Now get this mug. You've got the kind of chin I just love to touch. And if you don't get out of here, I'm going to hang one right on it. +++$+++ 1930s
Don't worry about it. +++$+++ 1990s
We were in love... weren't we? +++$+++ 2000s
What things? +++$+++ 1980s
I'll call you. +++$+++ 1980s
Of course. How am I gonna forgive him after what he did?! +++$+++ 1990s
Be my guest. +++$+++ 1980s
Let's try this way!  Holy Maker. +++$+++ 1970s
Hello, Grandfather! +++$+++ 1960s
Oh my! Oh my... Maybe you better come out now, Miss Starling. +++$+++ 1990s
Donut, get your camera. See if it's broke. +++$+++ 1990s
Thank you. +++$+++ 1980s
That's what you have to say? How could it be true? I never even heard of any procedure like this. It's a joke. +++$+++ 2000s
I looked everywhere, honey, but all I could find was your hat. +++$+++ 1990s
Yes...  well, there's one more stage -- trying to figure out if it's any good. +++$+++ 1990s
In my absence, try not to sell cigarettes to any newborns. +++$+++ 1990s
Just come down to my place of business, for god's sake.  I have people here. +++$+++ 1980s
Boss, we better roll if we're going to hit this place, blow it up, and make that flight.. +++$+++ 2000s
Can I have this? +++$+++ 1950s
You have a name, missy? +++$+++ 2000s
Mr. Scott, all power to the weapons systems -- +++$+++ 1980s
I must go. I'm in a hurry. +++$+++ 2000s
Ready for what?  What are you supposed to be doing? +++$+++ 1990s
That is an affirmative. I have victory dance. Mmmmmmm. +++$+++ 1990s
Well, there are, but for some reason they stop working at five-fourteen every night. +++$+++ 1990s
I don't know what you're talking about -- Get fucked -- +++$+++ 1970s
Tell him I'm sorry, ok, yes, you do that, now, I'm sorry, tell him, for all the things I've done...I fucked up and I'm sorry.... And I'm Gonna Turn Away And Walk Now And Not Look At Him Not See My Man, My Earl, I'll leave now...and tell him it's ok and I'm ok. The whole thing was ok with me -- and I know. +++$+++ 1990s
These are good. +++$+++ 2000s
He saved our lives. +++$+++ 1980s
I can't imagine how you ever let a man like that go.  I owe Viktor everything. +++$+++ 2010s
Hmmmm..... +++$+++ 1990s
She don't look Jewish. +++$+++ 1980s
Everyone takes his turn. +++$+++ 1980s
Then what'd you come here for? +++$+++ 1980s
Don't, Paul -- don't doubt yourself -- don't make me doubt you. +++$+++ 1940s
That's Daddy! +++$+++ 1950s
Well, thank you for all your help, Mrs. Johnson. +++$+++ 1990s
So? +++$+++ 1980s
I'll say.  This is solid gold. +++$+++ 1950s
Yeah? +++$+++ 1980s
No, no! I won't sign any pa- pers. You can't make me-- +++$+++ 1980s
‘That which does not kill me makes me stronger.’ +++$+++ 1990s
I'm not finished. I'll only be in port one week a month and when I'm here you'd never catch me playing daddy with you 'cause it's not who I am. Like I told you on the phone, you I'd be better off in that state school back in Virginia. +++$+++ 1980s
Yeah. +++$+++ 1990s
I don't know. +++$+++ 2000s
Well, I hope that you and your wife can come to the I.A.C. conference in June. +++$+++ 1960s
All right!  What'd she say? +++$+++ 1980s
Leo, I don't know. +++$+++ 1990s
Ninety. +++$+++ 1980s
'"... or I'll huff and I'll puff and I'll blow your house down!" And inside their new house, the three little pigs just laughed -- ' +++$+++ 1980s
So what do we do? +++$+++ 1990s
Don't even start, old man. +++$+++ 1990s
What is it? +++$+++ 1960s
Look, I'm just going to come right out and tell you why I'm here, okay? +++$+++ 1980s
I'm so close I can feel it. +++$+++ 2000s
My sister - My ADOPTED SISTER - +++$+++ 1990s
Fuck!  Fuck!  Fuck! +++$+++ 1990s
Where is she then? +++$+++ 2000s
If you're going to be indiscreet, I wish you'd be a little more discreet about it. Rich men, like Winton, love you and leave you. +++$+++ 1930s
You're Ro'tin, aren't you...? There's something in the voice.  Would you be his friend Gal'na?  I helped your mother bathe you when you were a child. She still speaks of you. +++$+++ 1990s
Got it, teach. +++$+++ 2000s
What? +++$+++ 1990s
Watch my stuff. +++$+++ 2000s
But what happens when they do find out? +++$+++ 1990s
No! Not the camera guy! +++$+++ 1990s
The swamp, most likely... Lombardo's a swamp rat, knows the body will never be found there.  But he's made a mistake. +++$+++ 1990s
What? What is it? +++$+++ 2000s
I couldn't say. +++$+++ 1970s
Suit yourself, kid. This isn't for me to decide. Of course, you could make a later train and still be in Albany tomorrow morning. +++$+++ 1940s
Because my boyfriend, who I thought was in America, is in fact in the next room. +++$+++ 1990s
Oui. Nathan's silk suit, just like you asked. +++$+++ 2000s
Catch a movie? Miniature Golf? +++$+++ 1980s
Please, you jump in some guy's face, talk smack and you get a pat on your ass.  But because I'm a female, I get told to calm down and act like a "lady".  I'm a ballplayer, okay.  A ball player. +++$+++ 2000s
Awright.  Get into position.  I'm rolling. +++$+++ 1990s
Somebody has to do it. +++$+++ 1980s
Here he comes. +++$+++ 1990s
I think someone broke into my house. +++$+++ 1990s
-- the James Dean wannabe with the hair trigger -- +++$+++ 1990s
Well, we want good stuff. +++$+++ 1980s
Fine.  Phil, you still there? +++$+++ 1990s
I'm Allison, you're 'honey'. +++$+++ 1990s
I know that girl! +++$+++ 1940s
I'm excused. +++$+++ 1980s
But then when will we see each other? +++$+++ 1960s
Rambo and Brewer were selected as write-offs. +++$+++ 1980s
Yes. +++$+++ 1980s
Sparkling apple cider? +++$+++ 1990s
Me! +++$+++ 1980s
Why do you do it if it hurts so bad? +++$+++ 1970s
Special Agent Jones. +++$+++ 2000s
No further questions. +++$+++ 1990s
Who do you think I'm doing this for? I'm doing this for you! +++$+++ 1990s
Do Peter Sellers again. +++$+++ 2000s
Ellie, we can tear up the rule book on cold-bloodedness. It doesn't apply, they're totally wrong!  This is a warm-blooded creature.  They're totally wrong. +++$+++ 1990s
Yes. +++$+++ 1980s
We're late. +++$+++ 2000s
My husband can't know about this. +++$+++ 1990s
The only girlish thing you have lost. +++$+++ 1960s
Stay away from me... +++$+++ 1980s
I was just somewhere else -- how did I get here? +++$+++ 2000s
Six. +++$+++ 1990s
Call the motor pool and authorise personal transport. +++$+++ 1980s
I think I'd better go tomorrow. +++$+++ 1960s
He's allergic. +++$+++ 2000s
Leon could still have hung himself. +++$+++ 1990s
No lightspeed? +++$+++ 1980s
Too late for what? +++$+++ 1970s
If Rick has the letters, he's much too smart to let you find them there. +++$+++ 1940s
We know you were with her. +++$+++ 1990s
...Would you, would you call him up. I'll give you my number, and ask him... +++$+++ 1980s
I don't know. +++$+++ 2000s
I don't know. I really don't. +++$+++ 1990s
What do you think has happened to your son, Mrs Spitz? +++$+++ 1990s
You know who The Raincoats are? +++$+++ 1990s
What do you feel like singing, Bob? +++$+++ 2000s
Cool.  Is there a menu?  Or buffet? +++$+++ 1990s
Just "lay back, Mack"... lay back... +++$+++ 1980s
And why is it a vacant exercise? +++$+++ 2000s
I know.  I just like to see you get all worked up. +++$+++ 1980s
It's a folk song. +++$+++ 1990s
Not at first. Oh yes, a few sparrows out for kicks... +++$+++ 1960s
This is a mistake. We better forget it. +++$+++ 1980s
[Me, too. Tell me about the guardians.] +++$+++ 2000s
Snoopy.  Christ, I thought he'd be brain dead by now. +++$+++ 1990s
So what's up?  What'd I miss? +++$+++ 1980s
I bet Scraps is going to love Mercury. +++$+++ 1980s
For the last time, put them on the table. +++$+++ 1940s
Bothers everybody who works there, but to me... It was... +++$+++ 1970s
Each inch represents 150 miles... +++$+++ 1990s
If they was just here for the fuckin', how come they lit out the back window? +++$+++ 1990s
Chill.  We don't want your face coming off with it. +++$+++ 1990s
What's going on here? +++$+++ 2000s
If Laszlo and the cause mean so much to you, you won't stop at anything. All right, I'll make it easier for you. +++$+++ 1940s
YOU are the one that decided to climb into this -- +++$+++ 1990s
Oh yes!  Who could forget.  Afterwards you sent me that amazing case of Chateau Lafitte. +++$+++ 1990s
Don't be shy.  There's time to stop before you go too far. +++$+++ 1990s
What're you afraid's going to happen? +++$+++ 2000s
The attacks are unceasing: by night, the Dark Ones; by day, those of our people who have sold themselves to them, those traitors who are called the Slayers. +++$+++ 1980s
Oh, yeah? +++$+++ 1990s
Well, don't you somewhere? Stuff? Belongings? +++$+++ 2000s
Where were you? You said you'd be back at twelve. +++$+++ 1980s
No!  Ditto the professor- +++$+++ 1980s
If I did-I don't-now. +++$+++ 1990s
I don't care.  Hank.  End it. +++$+++ 1990s
Very funny. Very funny. +++$+++ 1940s
Kevin?  Do you not love me? +++$+++ 1990s
Please!  I want to help you. Let me help you. +++$+++ 1980s
No.... +++$+++ 1990s
Not that.  Anything else. +++$+++ 1990s
Well, keep your <u>wits</u> about you, and let's see if we can't... +++$+++ 1990s
But... what about Starks? +++$+++ 2000s
It's very possible Ordell's killed somebody. +++$+++ 1990s
Well, George, I invest for a lot of people. I make a lot of money for them. More than they could do for themselves. +++$+++ 1970s
And why is that? Has something happened? +++$+++ 1990s
But Greta say -- +++$+++ 1990s
Fire insurance! +++$+++ 1930s
Maybe... look -- just... +++$+++ 1990s
It must feel great. +++$+++ 1970s
What's wonderful about the air, James? +++$+++ 1990s
I'm genuinely happy that you found some peace, Nancy. But you can't forgive for Liz.  No one can.  And you can't forgive for me. +++$+++ 2000s
They're gonna dig up stuff from your past, they're gonna throw it at you. I got to know what they're gonna throw. You understand? +++$+++ 1990s
Yes, sir. But he still feels his people should share in the increased profits of our news division. He has proposed an additional 500 million dollar payment. +++$+++ 1990s
She's been without therapy up here and I will not allow her to ruin... +++$+++ 1980s
When? When are you going to do it? +++$+++ 1950s
Is she responsible for the punch? +++$+++ 1970s
For that I'd kill a nun on Easter Sunday. +++$+++ 1970s
Nothing. As before. +++$+++ 1980s
Y'know, the guys in robbery are gonna get kind of upset.  We're stepping on their toes of this one. +++$+++ 1990s
Gee, guys, what should I do? The car or Debbie? +++$+++ 1980s
I think you better tell us. +++$+++ 1990s
What you run out on me for!  What you leave me alone for? +++$+++ 1950s
The whole town's gone crazy. +++$+++ 1940s
I'm frightened, Mitch. +++$+++ 1960s
He's dead. They're both dead. You don't understand what is on this ship. This is a being that kills. That's what he does. That's all he does. And he is very good at it. +++$+++ 2000s
Yeah you are and you hate it.  You hate the fact that your hand is shaking and mine isn't.  That you're sweating your balls off and I'm not. You've got fear and hate in your belly like battery acid, all because of me. +++$+++ 1990s
Oh God, what did you say, you dumb bitch? +++$+++ 2000s
You win some, you loose some. +++$+++ 1990s
Actually, these tests weren't available twenty years ago. +++$+++ 2000s
Sam, let me ask you a question. You must really trust your wife. +++$+++ 1990s
That's a wolf's head. +++$+++ 1980s
Stop saying the word!  The word we cannot hear!  The word ... +++$+++ 1970s
But Pappy, they's inter-grated. +++$+++ 2000s
Jeff, if you're squeamish, just don't look. +++$+++ 1950s
Christ, Michael - what the hell are we doing...?  We don't even know - +++$+++ 1990s
Ten thousand francs for each one. +++$+++ 2000s
I don't know what he's told you --  What <u>has</u> he told you?  Would you like to tell <u>me</u> -- ? +++$+++ 1950s
Where is it? +++$+++ 2000s
Mr Poe? +++$+++ 1970s
I knew it.  What does she know.  You want me to sing something? +++$+++ 2000s
Where's he? +++$+++ 1970s
He's a freelance subversive? +++$+++ 1980s
Elena, what are you're talking about? +++$+++ 1990s
Get up!! +++$+++ 2000s
Oh, no sir. Certainly not. Anyway, it's none of my business -- four apples, five apples -- what's the difference -- percentage-wise? +++$+++ 1960s
Yes, perfect.  As a matter of fact, I ran into Simone on the lot the other day. +++$+++ 2010s
Yeah, well we're still a little young for Albany State Prison. Are you pissed about Al? I'm pissed too, but I'm not like "twenty-five to life" pissed. +++$+++ 2000s
Are you crazy? +++$+++ 1990s
Is this slow enough for you? +++$+++ 1980s
New guy... +++$+++ 1980s
... And do give me some room, Voltaire.  You're breathing on my head!  I hate it when you breath on my head! +++$+++ 1990s
No. +++$+++ 2000s
I just heard them Karl. +++$+++ 1970s
So what? +++$+++ 2000s
Who pays for them? +++$+++ 1980s
I tell you, I could fly around this room with my eyes closed! +++$+++ 1990s
The Russians. On the other side of the river.  All you have to do is hang on for a few more weeks. +++$+++ 2000s
... well I'm glad you told me. +++$+++ 1970s
Meaning my house. +++$+++ 2000s
Wish I could help, Sheriff.  But if you'll excuse me I'm going over to Harlin's to pick up my car.  Then I'm getting the hell out of this place. +++$+++ 1970s
You would not...? +++$+++ 1970s
Honey? +++$+++ 2000s
Go on - you can have one! +++$+++ 1960s
You want a muffin? +++$+++ 1990s
Ok, now that that's over with...what are you gonna make me for breakfast? +++$+++ 1980s
I can handle it. +++$+++ 1990s
It's cold. +++$+++ 1990s
What?! +++$+++ 2000s
Tell me... +++$+++ 1990s
DON'T touch me.  Just get away from me. Go! +++$+++ 2000s
There's not much horsepower left in the engines, but there's enough noise...once this baby's set...I'll rev it up...that slimy bastard will come for it like candy... +++$+++ 1990s
I'm gonna need that hand back, Ed. +++$+++ 1990s
Funded by whom? +++$+++ 1990s
Free, if you're the president. +++$+++ 1990s
I'm just trying to find...  Who owns this store? +++$+++ 1970s
I haven't. No. +++$+++ 1960s
No. +++$+++ 1980s
The new vehicle, plus forty thousand dollars. +++$+++ 1990s
Dropped him, that was it.  Sorry If I made a worse mess for you. +++$+++ 1990s
Merry, how... oh, Christ, of course, you had my phone tapped. +++$+++ 1990s
Thanks for the vote of confidence. +++$+++ 1980s
I was a friend of Harry Lime. +++$+++ 1940s
Because this is important -- so don't just be polite.  I'd really like to look...what's the word I'm looking for?... +++$+++ 1980s
If you graduate. +++$+++ 1980s
Can't get a little bit pregnant, Bud. +++$+++ 1980s
Love a cup of tea. With lemon. +++$+++ 1970s
I like to travel.... +++$+++ 1980s
Okay. We're all here. Today's Wednesday. D-Day is Friday night ... That gives us two days to prep ... We're going to find the ladies on our list, find out where they live, when they're home; that they're properly insured ... Let's get into the vans -- +++$+++ 2000s
Captain... we've got less than ten minutes before that Vulcan ship leaves the system. We've got to go <U>now</U>. +++$+++ 1990s
I don't know. +++$+++ 1980s
Don't get premature on me, Jimmy. We don't light up 'til the Fat Lady sings. +++$+++ 1990s
Ilsa... you're alright? +++$+++ 1990s
I'm an old friend of Cochrane's... I wanted to see how he was doing. +++$+++ 1990s
Yeah. There was this cloud and I video taped it. +++$+++ 1990s
Mrs. Dudley'll be waiting for you. +++$+++ 1990s
No. The fetus was dead. Her uterus was virtually *disintegrating*--my stitches pulled right through the tissue! +++$+++ 1990s
I'm never unfair. +++$+++ 1940s
If they crash, maybe he'll run.  You can shoot him in the leg or something. +++$+++ 2000s
Okay, so we got a state trooper pulls someone over, we got a shooting, and these folks drive by, and we got a high-speed pursuit, ends here, and this execution-type deal. +++$+++ 1990s
Well, Mr. Cosgrove, I'll answer you point by point.  The King is exceedingly averse to make peers, as you know.  Your claim, as you call them, have been laid before him, and His Majesty's gracious reply was, that you were the most impudent man in his dominions, and merited a halter, rather than a coronet.  As for withdrawing your support from us, you are perfectly welcome to carry yourself whithersoever you please.  And, now, as I have a great deal of occupation, perhaps you will do me the favor to retire, or tell me if there is anything else in the world in which I can oblige you. +++$+++ 1970s
I'm not, you know. +++$+++ 1990s
There's a place over there on the bluffs. When the fog is just right, like tonight, the lights of Main look like a kaleidoscope. +++$+++ 2000s
That's the whole idea of living in the country.  I thrive on the seclusion. +++$+++ 1990s
Remember, he's the son of a Senator, so go easy. Kid gloves. +++$+++ 2000s
So was I.  The usual investigation turns up nothing more times than not. +++$+++ 1990s
If I don't 'grow up...' +++$+++ 1980s
Jim, you've got to let me go in there! Don't leave him in the hands of Twentieth Century medicine. +++$+++ 1980s
This isn't Mr. Goodman's idea. He is your good friend, whereas I am a victim of your carnivorous lunar activities. +++$+++ 1980s
Got him here? +++$+++ 1990s
Age is a limit we impose upon ourselves. You know, each time you Westerners celebrate your birthday, you build another fence around your minds. +++$+++ 1930s
Why yes.  I met you at the dog races -- say, you could have won that race if you tried a little harder. +++$+++ 1930s
Great.  Well, I'm sure glad that's settled, aren't you? +++$+++ 1980s
I think if anybody had a hand in killing Hocker, you ought to ask or you should have asked Emory and Chick. +++$+++ 1990s
Really think so? +++$+++ 1970s
It's important! +++$+++ 1980s
Special Needs class. +++$+++ 2000s
What are you talking about? I don't understand all this mumbo jumbo and the funny looks on your faces. +++$+++ 1990s
Oh, no. Just right. Your age fits you. Yes, sir, you look a little older without your clothes on. +++$+++ 1940s
I'm falling!  I'm going to fall! +++$+++ 1990s
My bourbon. +++$+++ 1980s
Maybe.  but maybe not.  We still don't have anything linking this to PG&E corporate. Plus, there's the statute problem.  Plus, we're way short on manpower, so we'd need to bring on more lawyers ... +++$+++ 2000s
Yeah, well I wouldn't expect too much. +++$+++ 1990s
Very well. +++$+++ 2000s
Those who I deem unworthy to pass through this camp will quit, and those who refuse to quit I will kill. You ever hear of a training accident -- give me a sir, yes, sir! +++$+++ 2000s
No you won't. +++$+++ 2000s
That's not news, Zoe. +++$+++ 1990s
Are you able to back up this allegation -- or are you fishing? +++$+++ 1990s
It's right on Hawthorne Boulevard and Manhattan Beach Boulevard. It's red brick... +++$+++ 1990s
No, they didn't say -- +++$+++ 1990s
Oh, I can't remember.  But people do have bad dreams when their routine is disturbed. +++$+++ 1950s
No, No -- I -- I just thought you hurt yourself. +++$+++ 1930s
I heard his voice as clear as day. I better get back. Maybe something is wrong. +++$+++ 1990s
Yes? +++$+++ 1990s
My friend Monsieur Philipe is a friend of Florentino. +++$+++ 1990s
...Were you? +++$+++ 2000s
I'll need the sergeant's okay on that. +++$+++ 2000s
Yes, sir. +++$+++ 1990s
No and I don't plan on sticking around either. +++$+++ 1990s
The sooner we do this the better, Mr. Baker. +++$+++ 1980s
I gave you my card there. +++$+++ 1990s
The NSA thinks the UN is onto your work... +++$+++ 1990s
Dead end--it's a clone.  What about the Mustang? +++$+++ 2000s
Perfect. +++$+++ 2000s
Like I had to say it? No, I wanted to say it. +++$+++ 1980s
Oh, yeah?  Then how'd you find my house? +++$+++ 1980s
Really? You'd do that for me? +++$+++ 2000s
Would you like a sandwich? +++$+++ 1970s
Frankly sir, you look a little like my father. Probably explains the curious feeling of love I have for you. +++$+++ 1980s
No, it's fine.  I'm fine. +++$+++ 2000s
Change lanes.  Then watch your rearview. +++$+++ 1990s
As of this moment you're six years old... +++$+++ 1950s
Swim for it! +++$+++ 1970s
Blue Five, does that glare bother you? +++$+++ 1970s
I'm making a mess. +++$+++ 1990s
Hey, another one for me and another one for the lady. +++$+++ 1960s
Which one's the Colonel's? +++$+++ 1970s
Goodnight, Ike, we're all going to bed. +++$+++ 1990s
But I'm not joking. +++$+++ 1940s
No. +++$+++ 1940s
But your men are watching over Yu's compund? +++$+++ 2000s
When I thought about you I was mostly hating you. Where've you been hiding? +++$+++ 1990s
All right, look, if he took a break, it would just give everybody some time to maneuver. That's all I'm saying. It's all that I'm saying. +++$+++ 1990s
Fiction or non-fiction? +++$+++ 1960s
Nothing yet. +++$+++ 2000s
Forget it.  I was joking. +++$+++ 1980s
Then... Where the hell are we? +++$+++ 1980s
'Cause it's nicer than my place. +++$+++ 1990s
I'm here on behalf of the crew, sir. +++$+++ 1990s
No, miss. Smoking makes him spit and feel ill. +++$+++ 1960s
Al? +++$+++ 1980s
Fucking-a it's five clicks! At one point I had to cut through an ostrich farm. Fuckers are mean. +++$+++ 2000s
You're kidding. +++$+++ 1980s
Yeah.  I practically forgot.  But after you busted that thing, I got to thinking, "Jesus--maybe I'll start the violin again." That didn't just belong to Woodly.  That belonged to everybody.  Maybe he would have sold it to me, and I could have some fun.  After you busted the violin, boy, and Penelope walked out, I thought to myself, "Jesus--who could blame her?" +++$+++ 1970s
Honey, this tie has a spot on it, I can't wear this today. I got a 10:30 with Chuck. +++$+++ 1980s
Stairway, youíre wrapped, go to transport. +++$+++ 1990s
I feel really good. +++$+++ 1970s
Ahhh...A little high on the left, don't you think? +++$+++ 1980s
Well, I'm a little muddled.  The Munchkins called me because a new witch has just dropped a house on the Wicked Witch of the East.  And there's the house, and here you are, and that's all... +++$+++ 1930s
Ten minutes... +++$+++ 2000s
We'll be all right...  We will... +++$+++ 1970s
Aach! -- Oh, hi, Bo. +++$+++ 1990s
Darlin', you ain't seein' Santos again, are ya? +++$+++ 1990s
Look at that! +++$+++ 1990s
No, not really. They can't be bothered collecting half a cent from your paycheck anymore than you could. +++$+++ 1980s
Thanks, Sheriff. +++$+++ 1940s
I do. +++$+++ 1980s
Yeah? +++$+++ 1980s
I do have eighteen criminals under sentence of death, but I hold no prisoners-of-war. +++$+++ 2000s
This afternoon? +++$+++ 1990s
Aye, sir. +++$+++ 1990s
Both of these. +++$+++ 1990s
YOU KNIT? +++$+++ 1990s
We need scissors over here! Who's got scissors?  Okay, remember.  Jack and I go on first, I do the set-up, then introduce you. And you say ... +++$+++ 1980s
You know what I think? +++$+++ 1990s
I can't believe that we're eating Cantonese.  Is there no Szechuan up here?  Hunan? +++$+++ 1980s
You're not my brother.  The brother I knew would never have been caught by that dumb fuck Archer.  At least tell me the bomb is still going off. +++$+++ 1990s
Ahh. +++$+++ 1980s
Thanks, sister. How are ya. +++$+++ 2000s
I didn't see nothing. +++$+++ 2000s
Only in some ways. You're prettier... +++$+++ 1950s
I always thought there was something wrong with him. Heh heh heh. +++$+++ 1990s
Oh, yeah. I'm just curious about that kind of stuff. +++$+++ 2000s
Yes, sir. +++$+++ 1930s
NO, seriously - I know he's your boyfriend, but there's something about his upper lip that is so weird.  What do you think it is, Dad?  Jen says it's a moustache, I say it's a cluster of about 11 mosquitoes, resting. +++$+++ 1990s
No. This works better. With you gone and I don't have the money, he can't touch me. But I can sure touch him. After I find him I'll come and join you. +++$+++ 2000s
You don't. +++$+++ 1990s
I don't know what you mean. +++$+++ 2000s
But you didn't even taste your cocoa. +++$+++ 1990s
Whoopee. +++$+++ 2000s
Hey, go easy, Tatum. He didn't do it. +++$+++ 1990s
Shit.  It's my Galiano. +++$+++ 2000s
Hurry! She's lost it! +++$+++ 2000s
Oh fine, fi. Keeping out of trouble, you know. +++$+++ 1970s
Brought what on myself?! I didn’t do anything! +++$+++ 2000s
I know one thing he said.  It was when... when he took himself out and was standing up.  He said, "Don't worry, I didn't come." I can't forget that.  He said, "No little girl can ever make me come." +++$+++ 1990s
I'm waiting till the time's right. +++$+++ 2000s
What is? +++$+++ 1980s
That is bullshit! Mine is a bitch and yours is a psycho. I can't believe you're saying this, Marylin! There's nothing wrong with us. We're attractive and charismatic and successful and... I like us. +++$+++ 2000s
I watched her eat the watermelon. And all this juice started running down her chin and onto her shirt. +++$+++ 1990s
This is fuckin' post-pubescent Disneyland. +++$+++ 1990s
What do I care about Arthur! Did you see this stuff in the paper? How'd it get in there? What'd you do last night? Who were you talking to? +++$+++ 1930s
Obviously. +++$+++ 1990s
You booger. +++$+++ 1980s
I've always respected Bree.  I'd like to make something clear. +++$+++ 1970s
I can't handle this tonight. I'm going home. +++$+++ 1990s
What do you mean?  I checked them myself.  I made the calls... +++$+++ 1990s
Where else, but in a cage, does man belong? +++$+++ 2000s
Fourth measure, second beat - F.  Flam-mis a-cri-bus ad-dic-tis, flam- mis a-cri-bus ad-dic-tis. +++$+++ 1980s
X22. Read. +++$+++ 1990s
If this war is about more than Thomas, it's about more than Anne, as well.  Stay the course. +++$+++ 2000s
But I think it's time we stopped talking about me. A woman like you -- why haven't you ever married? +++$+++ 1980s
I'm not. No. But do you think we could liven it up with a few words now and then? +++$+++ 1960s
Who you calling? +++$+++ 1980s
He's handicapped, huh? +++$+++ 1990s
What? +++$+++ 1970s
After the revolution, the Paris cemeteries overflowed. They dug up all the old bodies and brought them here. Seven million people. Mostly very poor. +++$+++ 1990s
What was he in jail for? +++$+++ 1940s
Great.  Gotta go.  See you then. +++$+++ 2000s
I guess maybe I won't write that book after all. +++$+++ 1930s
This stuff's deadly -- I hope we know what we're doing. +++$+++ 1970s
Why haven't you been able to contact him? He should have returned from the neutron galaxy ages ago. He may be dead. ZOR-EL But what can you, a mere girl- +++$+++ 1980s
Well? +++$+++ 1990s
Very well. If Zira and Cornelius can prove that those scrolls don't tell the whole truth of your history; if they can show you definite evidence of another culture from an unrecorded past -- will you exonerate them? +++$+++ 2000s
Not getting an answer?  For Christ's sake!  Call 911!  Let's get it locked down here! +++$+++ 1990s
People were gettin' bloody noses - - things on your head - - aneurisms - - +++$+++ 1990s
I'll tell ya though, it's comin' up to the time when Marietta and me might just set up house together and settle down... I think that time's comin' up right soon. But like you said, everythin's relative. +++$+++ 1990s
Just five dollars, please. +++$+++ 2000s
Maybe. She's OK. +++$+++ 2000s
Now could you leave me alone? +++$+++ 1990s
We don't have to do this. I'm a daytrader. I could just go home. +++$+++ 2000s
I don't think you understand.    I won't wait. +++$+++ 2000s
It doesn't ring a bell.  I have to go. +++$+++ 1990s
Nurse! +++$+++ 1980s
Sissy Clark, 190 Riverside Dr., apartment 3C.  Tomorrow.  She's a nursing student.  Paying her way as a cocktail waitress at the Peppermint Lounge, on west 63rd.  Left work at two A M...killed in her apartment, between two thirty and five. +++$+++ 2000s
I'm sorry to say I know what you're saying. +++$+++ 1990s
Merle, hey Merle, you got any socks? +++$+++ 1970s
Where's Shane? +++$+++ 1990s
He black alright, he just ain't blue. +++$+++ 2000s
There, what's that place? +++$+++ 1990s
Yeah. +++$+++ 2000s
Gosh, no. Lipstick? What next? Mascara, blush, floral-print dresses? +++$+++ 2000s
I'm moving. Remember? What's with the hooded cloak? +++$+++ 1990s
I just fired Bob Alexander. +++$+++ 1990s
Julia's my second wife. +++$+++ 1980s
I can only write on a manual. +++$+++ 2000s
I can whip your ass. +++$+++ 1990s
How do you know? +++$+++ 1990s
I have an appointment this after- noon.  I need someone to take them to the park. +++$+++ 1990s
I see. +++$+++ 1990s
She's so big somebody could come alongside her on the other side and we'd never know it. +++$+++ 2000s
I said, do you want some water? +++$+++ 1990s
Let him go, he said. Let him go. +++$+++ 1990s
At-at-at-at-at. +++$+++ 1990s
--no way-- +++$+++ 1970s
It's simple.  What was your pal Louis' first musical instrument? +++$+++ 2000s
It's a long story.  Right now we gotta do somethin'. +++$+++ 2000s
You kept her in this filth in restraints...?. +++$+++ 1990s
How do you do, Skye? +++$+++ 2000s
That doesn't bother you, does it? +++$+++ 1990s
This Zen master surfer. +++$+++ 1990s
You stumbled into my hiding place. +++$+++ 1990s
It's not so bad. I know the night janitor. And there's a broken locker I can put my stuff. +++$+++ 2000s
What about Captain Amazing? +++$+++ 1990s
He keeps on acting like such an asshole! +++$+++ 2000s
Davis. I'm not one to bad-mouth anyone, your joke was amusing. But come on, man, you had one fatal flaw: Bateman's such a dork, such a boring, spineless lightweight, that I couldn't fully appreciate it. I wasn't fooled for a second. Now, if you'd said Price, or McDermott...Otherwise, it was amusing. Now, let's have lunch or dinner or something. Hilarious, Davis. A killer. +++$+++ 2000s
...and I'm going to get bounced and you're... +++$+++ 1990s
Right, I guess those are the kids -- +++$+++ 2000s
I've noticed it, too. I'll cough up the money, Ellen. +++$+++ 1980s
Problem? - No problem - yes, everything's going fantastically well, wonderful, marvelous, great career prospects, Alison in great shape, kids fine, beautiful home, I'm on Security Level Five now, and Mr Helpmann relies on me more and more, yes, couldn't be better, I feel terrifically motivated and job- rewarded - +++$+++ 1980s
Excuse me? +++$+++ 2000s
Because she doesn't know what a hint is. +++$+++ 2000s
Who won? How did it end? +++$+++ 1980s
Yeah. +++$+++ 1990s
He is speaking about a baggage we never even meet! What will be left in your purse when he meets his Juliet? +++$+++ 1990s
Just a little something of my own. +++$+++ 1940s
No, no, no! I disagree with you absolutely. That's the trouble with you artillery men. +++$+++ 1930s
What's he doing here? +++$+++ 1990s
How? +++$+++ 1990s
Seein' he loved the experience so much, I think we outta give him the pleasure again. +++$+++ 1990s
Waiting -- I'm waiting for news from Manchester. +++$+++ 1930s
I have to go now. I'm sorry. +++$+++ 1960s
They ran out of names a long time ago in this part of the galaxy. +++$+++ 1990s
What'd you say? +++$+++ 1990s
Yeah, but you fangs can see in the dark. What am I supposed to do? +++$+++ 2000s
And the good news is you won't charge me. +++$+++ 1990s
Micheal? Do you have something to tell me? +++$+++ 1990s
Gee. +++$+++ 1970s
What? +++$+++ 1990s
Hey, Ben. Thanks for coming down. +++$+++ 1990s
This puts me in a peculiar hole. +++$+++ 1940s
Vacuum-sealed globe ... shouldn't take long. +++$+++ 1990s
Come on, Esperanza -- how about it? We got to. +++$+++ 1950s
I doubt it. +++$+++ 1960s
Very well. I shall drop you and go on to the party. I have no intention of missing it... +++$+++ 1950s
We're getting married. She said she could tell I was a great artist – she could see it in my eyes. She said she wanted to be by my side and have inter-racial babies with me. +++$+++ 1990s
Any more, O -- ? +++$+++ 2000s
What are we gonna do? +++$+++ 1990s
How long you been lying there playing possum with us, huh? Answer me! +++$+++ 1990s
Yes, sir. +++$+++ 1940s
Never touched me. +++$+++ 1990s
Tom, you're the Consigliere, what do we do if the old man dies? +++$+++ 1970s
Michael, I don't have time. Please!  It's time you dealt with this and got over it.  Now come on! +++$+++ 1980s
I'm hardly doing a thing.  The less I think of it the better.  My parents are arranging everything. The Gous are a very powerful family. My marrying one will be good for my father's career. +++$+++ 2000s
-- all we know?  We don't know shit, Powell.  If there's hostages why hasn't anyone asked for ransom?  If there's terrorists, where's their goddamn list of demands?  All we know is that someone shot up your car, and it could be the same flake you've been talking to on the radio! +++$+++ 1980s
Hold on... I know I have it... +++$+++ 2000s
If he can do it, yes. +++$+++ 1930s
Hello? +++$+++ 1990s
Well, actually, we've never met officially, but I bumped into you at the cafeteria and you were so sweet. I said, "I'm sorry," and you said, "Watch it, white bitch, or I'll put my size eight in your ass." I thought how cool. I wear a size eight, too. Anyway, this is my best friend, Cindy. +++$+++ 2000s
Wh-- She's never said anything, and we're very close.  She'd tell me such a thing. +++$+++ 1980s
I've got a feelin' today. +++$+++ 1990s
We'll talk about it later.  Right now, you gotta get changed. +++$+++ 1980s
Well, one was for salad... +++$+++ 1990s
[Not this way. Call it a little favor, call it a little thing I'm going to do for you. I'm going to make Chicago come alive for you. You'll owe me one.] +++$+++ 2000s
All this for laying traps on private land? +++$+++ 1990s
I need to see you, Ballard. I need to talk to you about the project. +++$+++ 2000s
Serves you right. Oughta be careful who you take up with on the road. You can't go plyin' your trade in my camp. +++$+++ 1930s
... He killed Win... he enjoyed it... +++$+++ 1980s
I suppose he was trying to make me feel bad. +++$+++ 1940s
What? +++$+++ 2000s
Like the saber-toothed tiger. +++$+++ 1970s
Don't feel like nothing. +++$+++ 1990s
Listen, Father! "Young Lochinvar smitten with Susan Paine"! +++$+++ 1930s
Satch, would you listen to me here.  Just you and me.  Can I talk to you here, alone? +++$+++ 2000s
They called, they're going to settle, what I want to do is build up as much ... +++$+++ 1970s
Now let's keep going here. +++$+++ 1960s
Thanks for the offer, Adrian.  I'll let you know. +++$+++ 2000s
Forget it, Carmen. The Mobile Infantery does a thankless, dirty job, so they naturally tend to be short-tempered, thoughtless and rude. +++$+++ 1990s
Thanks. I made them by hand. +++$+++ 2000s
Do you still...see each other? +++$+++ 1980s
So -- maybe I'm old enough to tell you how to run your life? +++$+++ 1940s
Who we are. Don't you think they're going to be PISSED? +++$+++ 1990s
Because of your phone calls. +++$+++ 1990s
Evening. Table for one? +++$+++ 1990s
Is Sunshine your real name? +++$+++ 1970s
Oh, oh.  That sounds personal. +++$+++ 1990s
They have found a way to penetrate our shields. +++$+++ 1990s
Their next target.  The name is Neo. +++$+++ 1990s
I'm not gonna break it, I just wanna see it change colors. +++$+++ 1990s
I will meet you, but only one way -- if Robert the Bruce is there, and puts his hand on my Bible, and swears his loyalty to Scotland. +++$+++ 1990s
So what did you say to my parents on the phone? +++$+++ 2000s
You're kinda the best thing that's happened to me in a long time. +++$+++ 1990s
I don't know what's keeping me.  I should've been here a long time ago. Now how about my proposition? +++$+++ 1930s
Oz, it's okay, I know. +++$+++ 1990s
Yeah... I know what you mean. +++$+++ 1990s
My Diary's in Berlin. +++$+++ 1980s
His death was -- yes, he died as he lived. +++$+++ 1970s
We must talk. +++$+++ 1980s
Is your back still killing you? +++$+++ 2000s
Jeffrey. +++$+++ 1980s
Believe it. +++$+++ 1980s
So many people - know me. I wish I did. I wish someone would tell be about me... +++$+++ 1950s
With your gun?... +++$+++ 1980s
I may run out of money, but you have already run out of bread. Two years is a long time for your comrades to wait. +++$+++ 1930s
-- Me? Neither. +++$+++ 1980s
How much? +++$+++ 1990s
To the stars. +++$+++ 1990s
Ssshhhhh! +++$+++ 1980s
Don't be ridiculous! They're just a bunch of harmless old men. My grandfather was in there. +++$+++ 1980s
That's just a dream, William! +++$+++ 1990s
This is crazy. I come home, you go to your room. You go in the kitchen, I go to my room. It's stupid. +++$+++ 2000s
I know better than you what people will say when they have to.  When they brought me in for questioning I informed on my friends the very first day. +++$+++ 1990s
She's gone! +++$+++ 1990s
Well, you're pretty close. It's only about two miles from here. +++$+++ 1990s
Well, I'm running out of trees, so look me in the eye like a man and tell me you don't know!  Convince me! +++$+++ 2000s
Caught my first tube this morning. +++$+++ 1990s
Yeah, French guys from France. +++$+++ 2000s
We really must go, Mr. President. +++$+++ 1990s
He paid you man. +++$+++ 1990s
Eh, what's all this? +++$+++ 1960s
It must've been a time.  A golden moment. +++$+++ 1990s
Yes. +++$+++ 1990s
I’ve scheduled a medical for you. +++$+++ 1990s
Well, I feel I owe you something for all this... +++$+++ 1950s
I think it should be outlawed. +++$+++ 1990s
Well, that's all that wrestling is. Except usually there's more grunting and squirming before the pin. Well, it's your first time. And you're out of your weight class. +++$+++ 1990s
I don't love him. I love Ronald. +++$+++ 1990s
Just let me rest for a second. +++$+++ 1990s
There must be some connection between the plane and this place. They must have deliberately brought us here. Why, Bob? What reason could they have for doing a thing like that? +++$+++ 1930s
How can I help but mind? I'm constantly humiliated...  just because I haven't money. +++$+++ 1930s
"You Send Me." +++$+++ 1990s
What is that, some kind of Chinese proverb? +++$+++ 1990s
Your call is come through. +++$+++ 1980s
What about it? Wouldn't you agree that a great deal of mischief has been done in the name of love? +++$+++ 1970s
Don't make me tell you, Jason. +++$+++ 1940s
What you are talking about is a gamble on moderation -- when I gamble, I prefer to gamble on force. +++$+++ 1990s
...to him. +++$+++ 1990s
Everyday I have my friend Rick here bring a newly-cut red rose in with him and keep it behind the bar.  And I award it to a woman of exceptional beauty. +++$+++ 1990s
You think I'm the WHITE ANGEL? +++$+++ 1990s
They don't have a murder weapon? +++$+++ 2000s
I don't know. Salmon. Don't you always have white wine with fish? +++$+++ 2000s
I don't have time for all this shit!  Just handle it, Bob!  Keep it out of the White House.  What else? Kissinger's waiting -- he's gonna throw a tantrum again if I don't see him, threatening to quit ... again. +++$+++ 1990s
Yeah.  Right. +++$+++ 1980s
Take a whiff of heaven. +++$+++ 2000s
Look, Lieutenant. All your dough won't help you here. Because here you're on your own. And no mother to throw you a lifebelt. Now let's see how good you can swim. +++$+++ 1950s
Uh, Amber? We're not puttin' on our Talent costumes. You need to put on your "Physical Fitness" outfit. And let's shake a leg, ladies. +++$+++ 1990s
Dad, this is what I really wanted to ask you.... +++$+++ 1930s
Injected Windex!  Why would he switch to a new m.o.? +++$+++ 1990s
Did you see anything in the files? +++$+++ 2000s
Ah -- that's where reason took hold. +++$+++ 1940s
Yes, Mr. Preysing -- that's what we want to know. +++$+++ 1930s
Not English. +++$+++ 1990s
No what? +++$+++ 1990s
Thank you for coming.  Would you care for a drink? +++$+++ 1990s
No, I'm serious...You're really good. +++$+++ 1980s
I know. I'm Andy McDermott. Terrence's nephew. +++$+++ 1990s
Well. What do you want to do? You want to steal one or just drive your car? +++$+++ 1990s
What the hell are you talking about? +++$+++ 1990s
Who's controlling your mind? +++$+++ 1990s
But there's one thing. The desk clerk seemed to be a little bit suspicious. I mean -- I don't know what their policy is -- but -- +++$+++ 1960s
How could they get by him? +++$+++ 1990s
Yes? +++$+++ 1990s
Let's have lunch! +++$+++ 1990s
What's up? Jess ready? +++$+++ 2000s
I haven't seen her in months. +++$+++ 1990s
Don't want weak legs. +++$+++ 1970s
Then? +++$+++ 1990s
You're kidding me. +++$+++ 2000s
You've been talking to her on the phone for weeks! +++$+++ 1990s
Come, come. You don't really expect me to fall for -- +++$+++ 1990s
Louder, girl! +++$+++ 1990s
Oh no! Tell her she's got to go back... +++$+++ 1950s
Walter. +++$+++ 1990s
So I said to myself, "All right, if he wants to look at them, let him look at them. No harm in that." And then he said, "Say ah." And then I said, "Ah." And that's all I remember ... And when I woke up, I still had my tonsils, but my pocketbook was gone. +++$+++ 1930s
Your Majesty -- some men are content to read about things.  I must see them with my own eyes.  I cannot be other than I am. +++$+++ 1990s
Okay?  I just blew up.  I feel orgasmic. +++$+++ 1990s
You're marrying again. +++$+++ 2000s
Does this violate the patient/doctor relationship? +++$+++ 1990s
And a *lot* of paper! +++$+++ 1930s
You know about animals -- their habits -- will it come back? +++$+++ 1940s
You won't shoot me.  That's not your style. +++$+++ 2000s
Funny -- you look married. +++$+++ 1990s
Doug sees beyond that stuff to what the person inside is like. That's why I'm marrying him. +++$+++ 1980s
He only had a hundred an' thirty. -- I think he's good for the rest next week, Mr. Gazzo. +++$+++ 1970s
Wait. How about this? +++$+++ 1990s
Come on. Let's go. +++$+++ 2000s
Can I ask you where you were the night Teresa Banks was murdered? +++$+++ 1990s
I ain't gonna leave a seven- hundred-dollar Remington behind. +++$+++ 1990s
You're not gonna tell Mom, are you? +++$+++ 2000s
Came  on back.  Let me show you where it fits in. +++$+++ 1950s
So was I. So don't give me any shit. Your business is just as bad. At least I'm up front about it. You kill people slowly. Your corporate take overs can decimate a families livelihood over a year sometimes two. Now you know how it feels. +++$+++ 2000s
It'll be very interesting to see how you go about solving this, Inspector-- +++$+++ 1930s
Of course.  Minister Johnstone. +++$+++ 1990s
Easy Sketchy. +++$+++ 1990s
A free thinker. +++$+++ 1980s
Well, I - +++$+++ 1990s
What're you askin' me for -- put 'em in the first helicopter comes in tomorrow. +++$+++ 1970s
You couldn't? +++$+++ 1990s
Am I artifact or dream?  You might ask that about anything. +++$+++ 1990s
Can't you just quit?  Walk away? +++$+++ 2000s
Thirty-seven! +++$+++ 1990s
But my neck hurts... and I have a slight cough... +++$+++ 1990s
...four years ago... +++$+++ 1970s
That <u>is</u> the plan...I mean, goddamn it!  What the hell are those things?  How could they bury an entire Plymouth station wagon? +++$+++ 1990s
I know. It won't go unnoticed. +++$+++ 2000s
Please prepare carefully.  This couldn't come at a better time. +++$+++ 1980s
Making it with my mother? +++$+++ 1970s
And they'll go out the minute there's another ray.  A cylinder reported down by Huntington Beach.  That's a job for the Navy. +++$+++ 1950s
Jordan.  I always hoped we'd get together -- though just now I'm gearing up for a child-care vote that -- +++$+++ 1990s
It was made clear.  Anyway, stay ballsy.  First week's hell, then it levels out.  Until S.E.R.E. training, anyway.  That's hell-and-a-half. +++$+++ 1990s
You mean -- +++$+++ 2000s
You haven't paid the cab.  He won't give us your bags 'til you pay him. +++$+++ 1990s
How did you know I was here? +++$+++ 1990s
Just gimme the damn remote! +++$+++ 1990s
Some other time, George. +++$+++ 1940s
He says things.  Bad things. +++$+++ 1990s
Alright, let's check it out. +++$+++ 2000s
Why, do you think? +++$+++ 1990s
But I have my clothes on! +++$+++ 1990s
What you have to get personal about so quick? All I mean is you could possibly read a book. +++$+++ 1990s
I don't care, Philip.  You want to go chasing Barbara Zelman, go ahead.  Just watch out for those buck teeth. +++$+++ 1980s
What? +++$+++ 1980s
A decent life?  Excuse me?  As what?  A janitor? +++$+++ 1990s
Well, it looks like we'll be getting our new school. +++$+++ 1960s
One time he was doing a rekkie of the Libyan coastline.  This is, like, right before we bombed Khadaffi into the past tense.  So his crew does a nighttime infil, maps all the big artillery placements and stuff, then turns around to get the hell gone.  But between them and the water are five Libyan guards, all armed to the nuts. +++$+++ 1990s
We have to launch his ship by tomorrow afternoon. +++$+++ 1990s
Benjamin -- I want you to know I'm available to you. If you won't sleep with me this time -- +++$+++ 1960s
Are there any other shuttles? +++$+++ 2000s
Right... +++$+++ 1980s
That's marriage. +++$+++ 2000s
We can't leave him! +++$+++ 1990s
Is it coming from our own computer? +++$+++ 1990s
And what do we get out of it? +++$+++ 1980s
Wing attack, Plan-R.  That's exactly what it says. +++$+++ 1960s
Are you screwy? +++$+++ 1930s
Why? +++$+++ 2000s
I still don't understand why you keep her around. +++$+++ 1990s
That depends on the tip. +++$+++ 1930s
You must be going somewhere. +++$+++ 2000s
Sure you are.  You're just a happier woman, cause you don't have to deal with maxi-pads and underwire. +++$+++ 2000s
But yours is the one who's going to subpoena me, Sam.  Force me to testify in court.  He came by the garage this afternoon.  Gave me this piece of paper. +++$+++ 1990s
Nice jugs. +++$+++ 2000s
D.C., Chief. +++$+++ 1990s
Yeah? +++$+++ 1990s
Do you think I'm strange? +++$+++ 2000s
Come in, Mr. Juarez. I'd stand, but, well, you know. +++$+++ 1990s
You don't like me? +++$+++ 2000s
I was, too. +++$+++ 1960s
So avoid using the word 'very' because it's lazy.  A man is not very tired, he is exhausted.  Don't use very sad, use morose.  Language was invented for one reason, boys--to woo women--and, in that endeavor, laziness will not do.  It also won't do in your essays. +++$+++ 1980s
I think it may help us but there’s a slight chance it could make things worse. +++$+++ 2000s
That is correct, Major. +++$+++ 1960s
Had a lot of blood in him. +++$+++ 2000s
Oh, I'll call you up some time. And if your social duties permit - why - +++$+++ 1930s
Close up shop! +++$+++ 1990s
Tomorrow morning, before the store opening. +++$+++ 1990s
Just checking, young sir. +++$+++ 1990s
All right, so I made another deal. +++$+++ 1990s
It's not the gas, Dad! +++$+++ 1980s
...No. +++$+++ 1990s
I don't like what he does. +++$+++ 1980s
The idea of going after guys like you appealed to me. +++$+++ 1990s
Yup.  Thanks for the ride.  You all take care. +++$+++ 1990s
Doctor King is my favorite. +++$+++ 1990s
You'll know soon enough. +++$+++ 2000s
Lip reading. +++$+++ 1960s
You want to "profile" me? Find out what makes me "tick"? Write about me, go on a talk show, give me a nickname? +++$+++ 2000s
A lovely piece of theater. Small but important. +++$+++ 2000s
I know what's eatin' you, kid. But I got two thousand dues-payin' members in my local— that's seventy-two thousand a year legitimate and when each one of 'em puts in a couple of bucks a day to make sure they work steady— well, you figure it out. And that's just for openers. We got the fattest piers in the fattest harbor in the world. Everything that moves in and out— we take our cut. +++$+++ 1950s
Oh, just like in the script! +++$+++ 1990s
I shoulda saved him 'cause he <u>believed</u> you? +++$+++ 2000s
Ya-hoo, let's'play ball! +++$+++ 1970s
What would you like, beer? +++$+++ 2000s
I'm real sorry.  My stockbroker must have transferred the wrong account... C'mon in, I'll write you another one. +++$+++ 1990s
You're lawyers.  How can you let this shit go by!  Look!  This?  Nixon can't say this. +++$+++ 1990s
Here, boy! +++$+++ 1930s
Lester, this is my friend Jill and this is Johnny Pope. +++$+++ 1970s
I think you'd better sit down. +++$+++ 1990s
Well, it wasn't a reduction like you do it!  Boiling down half a ton of bones... +++$+++ 1990s
I'm going to go powder my nose. +++$+++ 1990s
His head.  Someone cut it off. +++$+++ 1990s
ON CAIN, AS SHE LOOKS AROUND. +++$+++ 1990s
I know. +++$+++ 2000s
Kill myself. +++$+++ 1980s
It won't take but a minute. It's a votive offering for a lady who was cured just when she was dying of fever. Our Lady of the Helpless granted her a favor. +++$+++ 1960s
Intestines. +++$+++ 1990s
Shut the door, Lester. What do you think this is, a picnic? +++$+++ 1970s
They both have some growing up to do.  But they're good people, they're starting with love. They've got time. +++$+++ 1990s
Out my way in Montana we always call a bluff. +++$+++ 1930s
You're hung up again. +++$+++ 1990s
That-a-boy. Hospital. +++$+++ 1980s
James Looks Twice? +++$+++ 1990s
What did you do with her? +++$+++ 1940s
Louis the Sixteenth wore a fabulous stone, called the Blue Diamond of the Crown, which disappeared in 1792, about the time Louis lost everything from the neck up. The theory goes that the crown diamond was chopped too... recut into a heart-like shape... and it became Le Coeur de la Mer. The Heart of the Ocean. Today it would be worth more than the Hope Diamond. +++$+++ 1990s
Cuz once in a while soil need a change. Corn take up a lot of nitrate in the fertilizer. So next crop what ya do is plant ya some soy beans. That give off a lot of nitrate. Change keeps it all growin' and growin' strong.  Sting a bit? +++$+++ 2000s

Okay, Joe. +++$+++ 1950s
Fifty years. The rep is known around Philly, an' a good rep can't be bought, but I don't have to tell you that. +++$+++ 1970s
Here. I'll turn down the air conditioner. +++$+++ 1990s
Let's talk about the work that you care so much about. +++$+++ 2010s
I only exchanged a few casual words with her, as one would ordinarily do on a public bus... +++$+++ 1960s
Are these philosopher going to be here to help you fight your war? You know why I don't trust revolutions?  Because each of us is who we are:  we make speeches, print pamphlets, and we never change.  The world is not a philosophical abstraction, Mister Adams, it's us.  And, I don't believe you can ever change human nature. +++$+++ 2000s
I love you, Vanessa. +++$+++ 1990s
It means you don't talk to anybody. You don't draw attention to yourself in any way.  Do you understand that? +++$+++ 1990s
Yes how are you, Janet?  Are you happy? +++$+++ 1980s
You men remain seated! +++$+++ 1970s
There seems to be some confusion about your registration. I believe I can find you a place at the Ambassador. Many persons of the Jewish faith find it quite... +++$+++ 1990s
How old are you? +++$+++ 1980s
You watch that mouth. +++$+++ 1990s
I touched a nerve. +++$+++ 1990s
Good Lord, Freddie! What have you got in there? +++$+++ 1980s
I'm sorry. It just...It seems silly. Like kissing a girl. +++$+++ 2000s
The Aquarium was swell. If I lived in New York, I'd go there every day. I'll bet you do. +++$+++ 1930s

Don't go out of your way. +++$+++ 1990s
You did too. Sybok couldn't possibly be your brother because I happen to know for a fact that you don't have a brother. +++$+++ 1980s
It doesn't sound too bad. I'll try and stay awake. +++$+++ 1980s

How else was I going to get you here?  I haven't seen you in a week. +++$+++ 1980s
How did you come to have my address? Found it, did you.  Among her things. +++$+++ 1990s
His journals, letters, maps, books... +++$+++ 2000s
Where'd you go? +++$+++ 1990s
I could carve a better man out of a banana! +++$+++ 1970s
Everybody out, back to your tents, <u>now</u>! +++$+++ 1990s
Thanks. +++$+++ 1990s
That's what I mean... 'Night, Roy. +++$+++ 1990s
"Where the cup that holds the blood of Jesus Christ resides forever." +++$+++ 1980s
You're trying to save Sparazza? +++$+++ 2000s
Christ, it's Ho-Jon! +++$+++ 1970s
I'll have to find some more. +++$+++ 1980s
Look I-I-I'll be okay.  I'll be okay. +++$+++ 1980s
I don't thinkI can. +++$+++ 1990s
How 'you doin' man? +++$+++ 1960s
He's lost complete faith in me-- +++$+++ 1930s
Well... I mean... what am I supposed to say here, Bern?  Is this a riddle or what? +++$+++ 1990s
What went wrong?  Hang on, I think I know ... You kept things from her. +++$+++ 1990s
Fuck. Wade Whitehouse. It's people like you that keep this fucking town from prospering. Whatever somebody does to improve things around here, you gotta find fault with it. +++$+++ 1990s
Nonsense +++$+++ 1990s
I just stopped your heart for five seconds. It felt like an eternity, didn't it? Did you know that you can stop the human heart for up to ten minutes before the onset of brain damage? +++$+++ 1990s
Hi. +++$+++ 1970s
Great minds think alike. +++$+++ 1990s
So what makes you so special? +++$+++ 1990s
What time is it? +++$+++ 1990s
Maybe...? +++$+++ 1990s
Shhhh...don't tell no one.  Job security. +++$+++ 1980s
Did he say anything about me - tell me? +++$+++ 1940s
Oh my God. +++$+++ 1990s
It's impossible. +++$+++ 1990s
Instead you're going to bust your ass for five years so you can be broke? SKYLAR No, so I can be a doctor. +++$+++ 1990s
But why? +++$+++ 1980s
A yert.  Ruth is a living legend, Rex. At a time when most women are in Boca, having early bird specials -- she's working so her husband can be in Montana. In a yert. +++$+++ 2000s
If only I could find her. If only she could see me now, here, with such lovely kind friends. You, Mrs. Treves, and you, Mr. Treves. Then maybe she would love me as I am. I've tried to hard to be good. +++$+++ 1980s
Seeing you were her sole benefactor, and I'm the executive of the will, Kirsty's entire estate would have to be donated to the city. +++$+++ 2000s
It's happened before, you know! Some of the world's happiest marriage have started 'under the gun' you might say. +++$+++ 1950s
Well, Normie - you won't have to worry about this one being finished for a lonnnnng time.  How are the hands...? +++$+++ 1990s
Listen, I don't need any encouragement, but my idea of heaven is a solid white night club, with me as the head liner, for all eternity and they love me. +++$+++ 1970s
Dad, you and I have talked about this.  Lloyd and I have talked about this.  Believe me, this is well-covered territory. +++$+++ 1980s
I'm on Sunset. Near the Beverly Hills hotel. Wanna meet me for a drink in the Polo...? +++$+++ 2000s
Bimboo? +++$+++ 2000s
Well, honey, doctors are sadists who like to play God and watch lesser people scream. +++$+++ 2000s
Come here, son... +++$+++ 1970s
I can appeal in five. I was hoping you could help me Mr. Fazeli. +++$+++ 1990s
What are you doing? +++$+++ 1990s
I gave him yours.  Said, here, you want to write, I think this is a relative.  I guess I thought I was being true to Jenny.  Who told me she didn't have a father -- before proceeding of course to tell me why. +++$+++ 1990s
But I don't play anything. +++$+++ 1970s
All he can. All he can. +++$+++ 1990s
Man, I must really be stoned.  Thanks, buddy. +++$+++ 2000s
We trust you, Lloyd.  You know that. +++$+++ 1980s
Hurry -- hurry -- +++$+++ 1930s
I know. +++$+++ 2000s
So, what? The thing with the glass? Price did that? +++$+++ 1990s
If they catch you here, we'll both be in big trouble. +++$+++ 1980s
That, that was <u>business</u>... +++$+++ 2000s
...Count it if you want. +++$+++ 1980s
Denying? +++$+++ 1990s
Be careful. +++$+++ 1980s
No. I didn't know that. +++$+++ 2000s
You were there when I last saw him. +++$+++ 1990s
Shut up, will you? +++$+++ 1990s
If the Mario brothers weren't Jersey's third largest family, I'd say kiss my ass.  But considering your status, I'll say slurp my butt. +++$+++ 1990s
Well, I just want to know the procedure. I don't want to upset your routine. Do you want any jam? +++$+++ 1990s
'Cause you're gonna get me a disguise. +++$+++ 2000s
That wasn't my fault. +++$+++ 2000s
That is how V'ger will survive. +++$+++ 1970s
Well, I certainly would have heard about that. +++$+++ 2000s
Okay... +++$+++ 1920s
I believe you. Did that nice doctor let you out? Or is this you improvising again, Grady? +++$+++ 2000s
I'll be leaving now, Mrs. Stanwyk. +++$+++ 1980s
The men. Do any of them still live around here? +++$+++ 2000s
They're fine. My old man was a bus driver, mom a nurse--I was sort of born to it, I guess. +++$+++ 1990s
How could you possibly? +++$+++ 1990s
And where do you put these ghosts once you catch them? +++$+++ 1980s
I was doing my job. +++$+++ 1990s
Well, well, I'll have to put my thinking-cap on about all this. You'll leave the money as a deposit?  Very good. +++$+++ 1990s
Sit in this chair, and I'll pose you. +++$+++ 1950s
It'll be even shorter if I get that new job.  Come on. +++$+++ 1980s
Thelma, I'm going to Mexico.  I think I can make it in two and a half days, but I'm going to have to haul ass.  Are you up to this?  I mean, I have to know.  This isn't a game.  I'm in deep shit.  I gotta know what you're gonna do. +++$+++ 1990s
Come on, gimme some more details. How'd it happen? Some fuckin' drunk kill her? +++$+++ 1990s
Here it is.  A bird on one side. His cage on the other.  Now, stare at it.  The bird seems to be in his cage. +++$+++ 1990s
I find these wisecracks increasingly less funny! 'Aged in Wood' happens to be a fine and distinguished play- +++$+++ 1950s
They murdered my soldiers. Ten Belgians who I sent to get the lady minister. +++$+++ 2000s
And these are my associates, the Shoveler. +++$+++ 1990s
Neither do I. +++$+++ 2000s
Supposing she's an assassin? +++$+++ 2000s
I'm telling you what I have to do. What you have to do, in case you forgot, is come up with premium of a thousand bucks. +++$+++ 1990s
Explain what? How you were waiting until the time was right, and then you were going to dump me for her? +++$+++ 1990s
Coffee, Ed? +++$+++ 2000s
Your brother was a good man. +++$+++ 1990s
Take it, man! You're all right! Hold it in! GUARD! +++$+++ 2000s
What makes you so sure? +++$+++ 1990s
He's got a gun!! +++$+++ 1980s
As for our plan of action, anybody'd be insane to go in from the ground floor... +++$+++ 1990s
Oh well, then I'll put some cookies at the top of the stairs for you gals. +++$+++ 2000s
Because they told us that we mustn't use weapons, now, when the time is right. +++$+++ 1960s
Enjoy it, sweetheart... +++$+++ 2000s
You propose to a woman you should offer her a ring of engagement. +++$+++ 1980s
You don't want to say hi to your father? +++$+++ 1990s
These people are contemptible. They have no sense of dignity at all. +++$+++ 1960s
At the point -- I don't -- Look you'd be on TV maybe one or two times each. I'11 try to avoid I'11 go out of my way to avoid, getting together with you. Believe me. +++$+++ 1990s
I won't. +++$+++ 1990s
Do what? +++$+++ 1990s
What's this? December 8th, 1958? +++$+++ 1990s
You'll get to see the file on this case. And there's another reason. +++$+++ 1980s
How are you doing? +++$+++ 1990s
You was just doing your job. +++$+++ 2000s
I promised to protect her from people like you. +++$+++ 1990s
Sweetheart, you can get a whole big bunch. +++$+++ 2000s
You see? Life can be so simple. +++$+++ 1930s
Yes, Betty? +++$+++ 1990s
This tie cost more than your entire wardrobe. +++$+++ 1990s
What? I... I wasn't saying... +++$+++ 2000s
No, no, no.  You don't need my truck. You need somebody else's truck... +++$+++ 1990s
What? +++$+++ 2000s
She did.  Bring her back.  Now.  For a talk. +++$+++ 1990s
Yeah, but not seriously. Christ, you're ready to walk down the aisle- I'd say that constitutes something more than just seeing somebody. +++$+++ 1990s
You said it like it was a big joke, Bob. Like he's wild. +++$+++ 1990s
Like what you're doing. I'm not going to eat you up.  I need your help, and if you keep staring at me like that. I might start screaming. +++$+++ 1990s
It's slander. It's reckless disregard. I'll sue you and your fucking Jew paper. +++$+++ 2000s
Because I got off to a wrong foot with my own thing, you know.  B-b- b-but I need a dramatic change in my life. FATHER  You're gonna believe in Jesus Christ? +++$+++ 1980s
I think what you did... +++$+++ 1990s
You coming up on him? +++$+++ 1970s
No. They would never do that. +++$+++ 1990s
You're serious?  You'd help me... +++$+++ 2000s
We weren't rich.  But we weren't poor either. +++$+++ 1990s
Jesus, look at you   You're glowing. +++$+++ 1990s
Vince D'Agosta.  Am I out? +++$+++ 1990s
Why not just use a scope and a poison dart and snipe him from a hill? +++$+++ 1990s
Oh goody, nothing like spinning my chair around to a techno mix of Hava Nagila til I puke. +++$+++ 2000s
No.    145 Ridgeroad Way. +++$+++ 2000s
You're not the quiet type, Frances. +++$+++ 1980s
Bring him over sometime. I have some other stuff to show him. +++$+++ 1990s
I wouldn't say that--  I'm glad he's dead--yes--I'd thought of killing him-- but I didn't-- +++$+++ 1930s
I'm calling it three. +++$+++ 2000s
Do we know anything about him? +++$+++ 1990s
What would it take? +++$+++ 1990s
We've created a monster. +++$+++ 2000s
No, see, sweetheart, you don't want to stand up for parasite 'cause I can fuckin' smell him from here. You know what? Tow words, man: roll on. +++$+++ 1990s
His mother had a cookout a few weeks ago. He could do a lot better if you ask me. +++$+++ 2000s
Jesus, what a day. Felt like I couldn't've sold ice water in the Sahara. Jesus. Okay, so you don't want insurance, so okay, that's your loss. But God, people can be rude. Feel like I have to talk to a normal person like just to restore a little of my... +++$+++ 1990s
Like a home, for one thing. +++$+++ 1960s
Keep it between us girls? +++$+++ 1990s
Not you. Them. +++$+++ 1980s
I just, I don't know... +++$+++ 1990s
Nurse! Nurse! +++$+++ 1980s
Well, yes your nose is. Very. +++$+++ 1960s
...twenty-five thousand? +++$+++ 1990s
I do.  And I practice with them. At least three hours a day. +++$+++ 2000s
I'd say about thirty feet, sir. +++$+++ 1980s
Here are some blankets.  This is a good song, this is a really good song. +++$+++ 1980s
But that's an hour's drive. +++$+++ 1990s
So what do you want with me, Jimmy? +++$+++ 1990s
You moved? +++$+++ 1990s
What are your rates? +++$+++ 1990s
We're doing something -- ? +++$+++ 2000s
Then we have to find a safe port around here.  Got any ideas? +++$+++ 1980s
As a representative of Moscow... +++$+++ 1930s
...have you come back? +++$+++ 1930s
I want you to know we're going to do everything, in our power to get you out as soon as possible. Believe me. +++$+++ 1970s
I'm sorry. +++$+++ 2000s
Give it to me. +++$+++ 1990s
Look, a lot's been going on.  That's what I wanted to tell you guys about. I need to tell you.  You see... a while ago, I met this guy -- +++$+++ 1990s
Oh, about ten days ago. +++$+++ 1980s
I took advantage of you and worst of all, I'm not alone. I did this with a kid.  I was just on some ride where I thought I was in 1ove enough for both of us.  I did this.  And at least I can do something about it now. +++$+++ 1990s
I like 'em small. When you're inside a little Asian chick, it's like your dick is the axle that holds her body together. +++$+++ 2000s
What do you do? +++$+++ 2000s
I've been calling you for five minutes! Didn't you hear me? +++$+++ 1980s
Please, Jam, we're trying to vent some hostility here. Sure the whole thing may be your fault, but who's gonna get pissed off at you? +++$+++ 1990s
Oh, thank you, Amy. +++$+++ 1940s
- - shut up. +++$+++ 1990s
Ricky?  Where...what... +++$+++ 1980s
Just walk over here quietly now-- and there won't be any trouble. +++$+++ 1950s
The kind that gets divorced, but still stay friends. +++$+++ 2000s
On it!  I'm in it ... They think I did it! +++$+++ 1930s
Stop picking on him. +++$+++ 1960s
Is this normal? +++$+++ 1990s
Do you want your buttons on the left or the right? +++$+++ 1990s
It's just... I leave behind friends, family, a coupla good job offers in Chicago and in three dizzying weeks I've helped acquit a coke dealer, a speed dealer -- +++$+++ 1980s
It's about time. +++$+++ 2000s
I love you. +++$+++ 2000s
I assume you are making those cartoon noises to attract my attention.  Am I correct in my assumption, you fish-faced enemy of the people? +++$+++ 1960s
I better get you home before you catch your death from pneumonia. +++$+++ 1990s
On the modern novel - you remember what we arranged and we want you to talk on the Crisis of Faith. +++$+++ 1940s
It's the site of their new museum and we're taking it over.  Operation Deflower Mayflower is going full speed ahead. +++$+++ 1990s
He will be waiting... +++$+++ 1940s
All right, suppose it wasn't Tom Grunemann; where does that get you? +++$+++ 1970s
We could hardly say no. +++$+++ 2000s
Yes, Major. +++$+++ 1960s
Now I'll pump it up...  ... and you just turn the handles.  Okay. What do you smell? +++$+++ 1970s
Yeah, RIGHT. +++$+++ 1990s
Here. Let me put these in some rubbing alcohol. +++$+++ 1990s
You sure you don't want a ride to work? +++$+++ 1980s
I’ll call again. +++$+++ 1990s
You're going to need special care for a long time to come.  It's not going to be easy.  Not for you, not for any of us.  Because we love you so much.  And it's going to cost money.  More than we can imagine. +++$+++ 1990s
The Son'a reports claim they didn't fire until after he malfunctioned. +++$+++ 1990s
No, it is. It's just one more thing to add to your "things that make you a better person than me" list. +++$+++ 1990s
This is fucking unbelievable.  Zuzu, it's a long story, you see... +++$+++ 1990s
Right! +++$+++ 1990s
Figures. +++$+++ 1980s
Stay in the car. I'll only take a second. +++$+++ 2000s
Alright, do what you want. But keep the screws on him. He's a wild card. That could be either good or bad. +++$+++ 2000s
Professor Tripp? +++$+++ 2000s
Compensate! +++$+++ 1990s
He has to look here or I won't get a clear shot.  Call him, Margo. +++$+++ 1990s
Even that could be a trick. You escape, then show up at the address which the brothers in prison gave to you, and so you are able to contact me ... +++$+++ 1960s
I don't think I could. +++$+++ 1990s
Friends call me Otis - sometimes Tricky Otis. +++$+++ 1950s
You're groping.  I have been fair. It's my move now. +++$+++ 1990s
I don't know -- the gym, the fights. I <i>know</i> he don't miss the fights.  Having some tomorrow night at the State Theater.  He use to take me. +++$+++ 1990s
I'm not a hire car.  It's against regs? +++$+++ 2000s
No. +++$+++ 1990s
Your prerogative, Senator. +++$+++ 1990s
I would have figured you an R.N. by now, or, maybe Med School. +++$+++ 2000s
Sounds like a two weeks' notice to me. +++$+++ 1930s
Was she the only one? +++$+++ 1990s
You know what a hostile gesture that is to me? +++$+++ 1970s
This is the shell.  What about the gun? +++$+++ 1990s
Yeah. +++$+++ 1990s
Yes. +++$+++ 2000s
Not anymore, not in the city. +++$+++ 1990s
It seemed like my life was slipping away, somehow. I was a knot in the middle of a wet rope. Everything was futile and nothing had value. +++$+++ 1990s
OK, cop. I want you to give yourself and your friends on the force a message. Tell them I've got my own reasons to be very interested in whomever did the job on the nuns. I'll double the Church reward if you bring those punks direct to me. 100 G cash. Get it? +++$+++ 1990s
I don't believe you had a mother. +++$+++ 1990s
It's not gonna take long, Sam. +++$+++ 1990s
A cup of tea would be nice.  Would it be alright if I sit down for a few minutes, Mrs. Otto?  I want to talk to you. +++$+++ 1990s
That staggering. His dying so quickly.  In your campaigns, have you never seen men who staggered before they died, who talked incoherently —— walked blindly. +++$+++ 1940s
It's going to be closer.  You better get going. +++$+++ 1980s
Stanford. I'm leaving in June after I graduate. +++$+++ 1990s
I can't hear him. +++$+++ 1970s
We don't have a choice Jen. We're stuck until he comes back. +++$+++ 1990s
Now you are being rude. +++$+++ 1990s
Neither do I. +++$+++ 1990s
Poor Madame Yakushova... here we are talking in mysteries.... I'm sure you wonder what it's all about. +++$+++ 1930s
No. No, they're white. He's got a nice dog. +++$+++ 1970s
Adrian -- you've lost it. +++$+++ 2000s
Take your time. Enjoy L.A. +++$+++ 1990s
She should be shortly. +++$+++ 1990s
Millions, Stephen -- And sexual favors. +++$+++ 1990s
I wanted you here so we could have a few months together.  Maybe everything happens for a reason.  Something bad to force something good. +++$+++ 2000s
Well, where? +++$+++ 1990s
Take the Getty Center exit -- make a right onto Cisco.  It'll be a narrow winding road.  You can't miss the house.  It's a mansion built back in '29 -- Spanish -- boarded up since the quake. +++$+++ 2000s
If he's one of those Things, we've got to get to him before he changes... Nauls, you and Childs and I'll check the outside shacks... +++$+++ 1980s
Hi.  Listen.  Could I steal you a second? +++$+++ 1990s
The EPA?  What's he want? +++$+++ 1980s
Five bucks! You mean you're going to charge me five bucks just to look at it? +++$+++ 1990s
I thought, geez, is that Margie Olmstead? I can't believe it! +++$+++ 1990s
But Irena is in the garden. She's right there, under the tree. +++$+++ 1940s
I'm really beat.  I need some serious "z's"-- +++$+++ 1980s
Have you been hurt? +++$+++ 2000s
This is where I get off. +++$+++ 1950s
That was to get him to talk!  Get rid of that thing, will you? +++$+++ 2000s
Wow you are out of it. +++$+++ 2000s
Yes.. +++$+++ 1990s
I'd rather take my chances with them... than with Francis. +++$+++ 1970s
I've been investigating sightings for seventeen years, Mr. Shermin. This one's real. We have a dead extra- terrestrial in that tent and another one in the area that might be alive. We've been visited. It's finally happened and the sooner Washington accepts that and starts figuring out how we're going to deal with these beings, the better off we're going to be. +++$+++ 1980s
You must have some idea about him. +++$+++ 1990s
I don't understand.  Aren't you frightened? +++$+++ 1980s
What? +++$+++ 1990s
But Mose Harper said... +++$+++ 1950s
How's it going? It's been a while... +++$+++ 1990s
Yes. +++$+++ 1990s
Hi. +++$+++ 2000s
I apologized, I offered to help. +++$+++ 1990s
What about the Cromwells? +++$+++ 1980s
Malcolm, they keep calling, threatening us. I'm going crazy, when is this going to stop? +++$+++ 1990s
It's obvious that the girl doesn't want to accompany you, isn't it? +++$+++ 1980s
I know. And that's great. But it would be great in a better way, not a better way but a different way, if I could find him and bring him back. +++$+++ 2000s
Yes, they don't like hearing it and find it difficult to say.  Whereas without batting an eye a man will refer to his "dick" or his "rod" or his "Johnson". +++$+++ 1990s
Put your arms around me. +++$+++ 2000s
I do.  I take it all very personally.  Very nice meeting you, Vivian. +++$+++ 1990s
The door's locked. I'll gotta go around... wait here. +++$+++ 2000s
Einstein, right?  We'll see ya. +++$+++ 2000s
What is that? +++$+++ 1990s
Get me a typewriter.  I'll finish the notice. +++$+++ 1940s
What's the fucking point in any case...?  What's the point.  I got to argue with you, I got to knock heads with the cops, I'm busting my balls, sell you dirt to fucking deadbeats money in the mattress, I come back you can't even manage to keep the contracts safe, I have to go back and close them again...What the fuck am I wasting my time, fuck this shit.  I'm going out and reclose last week's... +++$+++ 1990s
Just fine. +++$+++ 1950s
Nah. +++$+++ 1990s
You fucked us over. +++$+++ 2000s
Five? +++$+++ 1990s
I want to talk to you. +++$+++ 1940s
Engaged. +++$+++ 2000s
...Congratulations, kid, you've really outdone yourself. Reinvented the wheel. I'm going to recommend to the Board that we proceed immediately with this, uh... with the, uh... that the dingus be mass-produced with all deliberate speed. Of course, as president of the company the ultimate decision is yours. +++$+++ 1990s
I didn't. I got a job, too.  I wonder if that hurt her, my not letting her sacrifice for me?  Some people are so willing to suffer for you that they suffer more if you don't let them. +++$+++ 1960s
He no longer roars or spits. He no longer taunts the guards or molests his fellow wards -- +++$+++ 2000s
Helen-Thomas-Webber!  Maybe we have been down here a little too long!  Please excuse her French. +++$+++ 1990s
He was getting on . . . and then this man with luggage and . . .  oh, it's a long story. +++$+++ 1980s
That the virus was taken from Philadelphia to San Francisco, then to New Orleans, Rio de Janeiro, Rome, Kinshasa, Karachi, Bangkok, then Peking. +++$+++ 1990s
Those are my clothes. +++$+++ 1990s
Are you open? +++$+++ 1990s
Gibarian was under enormous -- +++$+++ 2000s
Not really. +++$+++ 1990s
Maybe he's talking to himself. +++$+++ 2010s
I don't wanna work at all. +++$+++ 1930s
You think things would be any different now? +++$+++ 1990s
Okay, ma'am, just a moment. +++$+++ 1990s
But the point is Dickie -- well we know this -- Dickie loves Marge and he misses her and apparently he's come to his senses... +++$+++ 1990s
Yeah. +++$+++ 1980s
Oh. +++$+++ 1940s
Yeah. +++$+++ 1990s
HARRY Dunne. +++$+++ 2000s
Wow. Hey, I was just about to order some dinner. You eat Chinese, right? +++$+++ 1990s
Perhaps. +++$+++ 1930s
'U.S.S Indianapolis.' 1944. +++$+++ 1970s
These can be such trying situations everyone seems to make such a to-do over a simple little accident. Of course, they can be very frightening, and I must apologize for David, he's never had an accident before. +++$+++ 1970s
No, we're not. +++$+++ 1990s
Hi. +++$+++ 1980s
Time out! +++$+++ 1970s
He... didn't have me..  I told you- +++$+++ 1990s
How? +++$+++ 2000s
Disappointment? J'etais destroyee! I was in bed for a week! Positively sick with fury! I called in the gardener and said, 'Monsieur Gonzalez, either those azaleas come up next spring or you are terminee! +++$+++ 1990s
I'm telling you it's a forgery. The paint's still wet for God's sake. +++$+++ 1990s
I've taken the spear for a lot of people, Sway. Including you. Can't we improvise a little here ... ? +++$+++ 2000s
...So Cornelius was telling the truth! +++$+++ 1990s
What's your problem? +++$+++ 1980s
Sorry, I don't remember. +++$+++ 2000s
Be cool, man. You're having a paradoxical reaction. It can happen.  Didn't I tell you this guy was stressed out? +++$+++ 1990s
Me? +++$+++ 1980s
Stop saying you're sorry. I want information, not regrets. +++$+++ 1990s
Nancy?  Would you sit with me awhile? +++$+++ 1980s
Who do you think changed the parade route? +++$+++ 1990s
At my age, I'm going to take any pill that makes me feel better. +++$+++ 1990s
You wouldn't dare. +++$+++ 1980s
Going away doesn't mean you leave Lasher behind. He was on Rowan's deck - and the plane...  geography seems irrelevant now. +++$+++ 1990s
I told you, he's one of Dino Velvet's stock players... +++$+++ 1990s
How much time do you need? We have seventeen hours and forty-two minutes. Now: what is in the Core? +++$+++ 1990s
Was her breakfast conversation that bad? +++$+++ 2000s
It matches the pictures. +++$+++ 1990s
You should have tried harder. +++$+++ 2000s
Rachel come on. +++$+++ 1980s
I guess still in the locker. +++$+++ 1990s
Two of the horses ran off, but that pinto you're riding hung around. +++$+++ 1980s
What it will be. +++$+++ 2000s
Yes. He spoke to me. He said I would fight bravely tomorrow. I have never dreamed of Merlin before. +++$+++ 1980s
Heh heh. We wanna do her now! +++$+++ 1990s
That's the best part.  She gets it all -- everything. +++$+++ 1990s
Rinaldi... Rinaldi...  What region do you come from? +++$+++ 1990s
Yeah. +++$+++ 2000s
Maybe you should be. +++$+++ 2000s
Say, isn't this your twenty dollars? +++$+++ 1940s
I'm from Akron. +++$+++ 1990s
I've searched the entire world for you, Buffy. +++$+++ 1990s
I'm the Sufi. +++$+++ 1980s
Who's that? +++$+++ 1990s
Beverly! Not the Sterners! +++$+++ 1990s
Beat the shit out of someone who hates you. +++$+++ 1970s
Not as single-minded as the others, not as sybaritic.  Almost thoughtful. She's useless. +++$+++ 1990s
Where were you? +++$+++ 1980s
Can we go up? Do you mind? +++$+++ 1990s
Hey, <u>the movie's getting made</u>. That's the main thing. +++$+++ 1990s
And Gaston, I was happier all day long. I felt I'd contributed something. +++$+++ 1930s
Did you? +++$+++ 1970s
What is...  ...Coke? +++$+++ 1980s
Before or after the explosion?  Mueller -- +++$+++ 2000s
He didn't give you an address? He didn't give you a phone number? +++$+++ 1990s
Tomorrow night as a matter of fact. +++$+++ 1990s
Well, I mean...I wanna be on TV. Maybe have a talk show or something. Like Conan. Or early Letterman. +++$+++ 2000s
Do you know what to do? +++$+++ 1990s
I don't know... maybe I'll live on a boat, sail to all the places I've never been. +++$+++ 1990s
Got her right where you want her, Junior. +++$+++ 2000s
Please, Sylvia!  It's a quarter to nine! +++$+++ 1960s
Michael - I saw him!  Twice!  Carlotta said I  ---  killed Graham - with - with my anger. +++$+++ 1990s
I -- lost something. +++$+++ 1940s
Uh huh. +++$+++ 2000s
Don't mock, Claudia... +++$+++ 1990s
Th-th-they, they wanted me for a screen test. +++$+++ 1980s
That's ancient history.  That has nothing to do with you and I. +++$+++ 2000s
Don't want to film this? +++$+++ 2000s
You idiot. Off the record, deep background: I've got that beach crawling with undercover cops. +++$+++ 1980s
You realize what is at stake? +++$+++ 1990s
No, I don't want one.  Hey, Mr Clark, how you doin'? +++$+++ 1990s
Yes. +++$+++ 1980s
It's up there, on the Tower. +++$+++ 1990s
You don't know him. I'm so stupid. +++$+++ 1990s
Physicians are a waste of time. You'll have more luck with this charm of mine... it saved my life at Agincourt! +++$+++ 2000s
Um. +++$+++ 1970s
Shouldn't you have used a toggle bolt? +++$+++ 1990s
Jeffrey? +++$+++ 1980s
There's no lady here. +++$+++ 2000s
Do you often make a habit of sitting on strange men's beds? +++$+++ 1990s
Coupla days ago they dug up a body in Washington Heights - Mary Finelli.  Girl disappeared in '68.  Turns out she was his first kill.  Which means he probably knew her.  Most serials know their first victim.  I'm gonna do some checking - see if I can put any of this together... +++$+++ 2000s
Geoffrey's not in Cairo.  He's not actually a buffoon.  And the plane wasn't a wedding present. It belongs to the British Government.  They want aerial maps of the whole North Africa. So I think he's in Ethiopia.  In case you were counting on his sudden appearance. +++$+++ 1990s
Oh, shit. +++$+++ 1990s
I'm not mad.  I am, but I'm not.  Y'know? +++$+++ 1990s
I waited up till midnight. +++$+++ 1950s
I don't know. +++$+++ 2000s
Ahhh...nothing. +++$+++ 1980s
Two hundred meters. +++$+++ 1980s
Where? +++$+++ 1980s
Tore up from the floor up? +++$+++ 2000s
Nothing, if you work in a fill- ing station.  And I'm getting rather bored with that sport jacket, and those same baggy pants.  Max, what's a good men's shop in town?  The very best... Well, go there ! +++$+++ 1950s
We're having some problems with ARCADE... +++$+++ 1990s
What about the staff?  They’re in on what’s going on, aren’t they?  How many of them? +++$+++ 1990s
That's good. At least they're interested. +++$+++ 1990s
We'll deal with that when we come to it.  <u>This</u> is producing.  <u>This</u> is what they pay off on...come on, Pal, Boots and Saddles... +++$+++ 1990s
I'm a bowler. +++$+++ 1990s
Now. You say the driveway's on your side of the house. So I guess you don't sleep in the same room. +++$+++ 1960s
Don't wake the kids... +++$+++ 1990s
For a movie? +++$+++ 1990s
Perhaps I was never meant to live with a woman... +++$+++ 1990s
Tell him what, what do you want me to tell him? +++$+++ 1990s
I'm sure he could give you some courage. +++$+++ 1930s
"I can always find someplace else to work. Someplace that'll pay me a fortune and give me a view of the French Riviera ..." +++$+++ 2000s
They're --  -- What? +++$+++ 1990s
Well, he got away, didn't he?  Riding a donkey not far from here when the lion sprang on them- donkey took the brunt of it- then suddenly the lion ran off. +++$+++ 1990s
I... feel.... pretty. +++$+++ 1990s
Hey, watch it! +++$+++ 1990s
There's other things to be learned. +++$+++ 2000s
I hear he's around Palm Springs. Dealing our product. Product we sold to you for five hundred thousand dollars.  Why do you keep talking to me bullshit? I think maybe I have Ramon and Ceasar staple your tongue to your chin. What do you think? +++$+++ 1990s
It is waiting for you in the garage. +++$+++ 1970s
Goodbye, Mr. Fielding. +++$+++ 1950s
Maybe there was traffic. +++$+++ 1990s
Elizabeth! Little Elizabeth! Why you're so... middle aged! +++$+++ 1990s
Sometime after 1:00 a guy's gonna call here and give you the name of a horse.  All you do is take this two grand across the street to Shaw's place and bet it on that pony.  There's nothin' to it, but don't take too much time.  We only have 3 or 4 minutes after you get the call. +++$+++ 1970s
No, I can't. You know what I heard the other day? "Heartbeat-It's Lovebeat," by little Tony DeFranco and the DeFranco Family. I haven't heard that since I was in fifth fuckin' grade. +++$+++ 1990s
MARK IT ZERO! +++$+++ 1990s
I want you to hurt me. +++$+++ 1990s
I don't have your number, stop by the shop. +++$+++ 1970s
Want a list? +++$+++ 1990s
Places where the road bends, places away from buildings, places where the traffic thins out. But you don't have to understand. I do. So no talking. +++$+++ 2000s
That's not Paul Owen. Paul Owen's on the other side of the room. Over there. +++$+++ 2000s
Huh? +++$+++ 1950s
Yes. +++$+++ 1990s
Invite me in, Pike. +++$+++ 1990s
What. +++$+++ 1990s
He would take you on.  Yes. +++$+++ 1990s
I guess you're,right.  Well, what do you say we get a little midnight snack? Theo's should still be open. +++$+++ 1980s
You know? +++$+++ 1980s
Jesus... +++$+++ 1990s
He just wanted a few minutes before -- +++$+++ 2000s
I was supposed to take the children to New England next week. +++$+++ 1970s
Give me some credit. I got you this far, let's go to the grand jury. This is never going to stop if we - +++$+++ 1990s
They'll be sending you up there soon enough. And not just for a visit, neither. +++$+++ 2000s
We have to stop meeting like this. +++$+++ 1990s
Satan's in this little fella tonight! +++$+++ 1930s
Katherine?... Katherine who? +++$+++ 1970s
Oh. I see. +++$+++ 1990s
Staff sargeant detailed me to prepare firewood for the break- fast cooking. +++$+++ 1980s
Diane? +++$+++ 2000s
Usual bullshit.  You make one smart move and everybody wants to be your friend... You know somethin', shootin' guys sucks. Especially compared to this. +++$+++ 1980s
I found him. +++$+++ 1990s
Why are you doing this? +++$+++ 1990s
Anything today? +++$+++ 1950s
...I want to....I want so many things, Claudia. Maybe we can just talk to straighten our things out....there are so many things that I want to tell you -- +++$+++ 1990s
Then you came to a desert and mountains... +++$+++ 2000s
Deals? +++$+++ 2000s
Hey, I brought some friends. And some beer. +++$+++ 1980s
Uni High Tigers, sir. Don't you remember ? I was captain of the team. +++$+++ 1990s
There's going to be some irate citizens when they find out they're paying for water they're not getting. +++$+++ 1970s
Jump in. +++$+++ 1990s
That's very linear Sheriff. +++$+++ 2000s
Shut your ass up and grab the wall! +++$+++ 1990s
She's the one to blame. Not me. +++$+++ 1990s
I better do this, Stan. +++$+++ 2000s
Who said it wa's me, hub?  Anyway... he fell off a ladder.  It wasn't really my fault. +++$+++ 2000s
Does Dorothy know her husband is dead? +++$+++ 1980s
Then don't. +++$+++ 1990s
I'm tellin' you, she'll be there, I know she'll be there. Dressed up and everything. +++$+++ 1980s
If he's reasonable, maybe we can make some kind of deal. If not. We'll have to re-consider our options. +++$+++ 2000s
In a little while. That's what you want, isn't it? +++$+++ 1960s
There's a guy down the hall.  Complaining about the noise.  Says he can't sleep. +++$+++ 2000s
And he's a patient of yours? +++$+++ 1990s
I'm sure she found your lectures fascinating. +++$+++ 1990s
Claire, Claire, Claire, if you're not dead, he's going to assume you're with me. +++$+++ 1990s
Hey, you guys, what's going on? +++$+++ 1980s
The way you drove that car, I figured you for the streets. +++$+++ 1980s
That's no way to talk... +++$+++ 1950s
What do you do for a living? +++$+++ 1970s
You blew it -- big time.  She doesn't want you back. +++$+++ 1990s
They want me to do things for them. +++$+++ 1990s
My house. +++$+++ 1990s
Your husband returned at, what, seven o'clock? +++$+++ 1990s
There's a light up ahead. +++$+++ 2000s
Thanks Walter. +++$+++ 1990s
What run him off? Tell me that! +++$+++ 1990s
Oh, Ted, please be careful. I worry about you so much. +++$+++ 1980s
He's right. You'd feel much better about it. +++$+++ 1990s
I'll kill myself. +++$+++ 1970s
You really use strong language. +++$+++ 1990s
That's going to fit me? +++$+++ 1990s
Now? +++$+++ 1990s
Stop it, stop it, you satanic whore! +++$+++ 2000s
Well? Supper at my place? +++$+++ 1970s
Who are you? +++$+++ 1940s
But, Bishop... +++$+++ 1990s
This is nuts. +++$+++ 1990s
She just called.  She doesn't even know.  It's probably the last time I'll ever hear her voice.  That's weird, isn't it?  You spend Christmas at somebody's house, you know, and you worry about their operations and you see them in their bathrobe, and... I dunno... +++$+++ 2000s
I'm a little worried, James. +++$+++ 2000s
Yes I am. +++$+++ 1960s
How fortunate. +++$+++ 1980s
We are trying to stand out. Right near his address. Easier to get them to come to us, than to try and find them. ..now keep your eyes open, something might present itself. +++$+++ 1980s
No joke. This is probably the best hamburger I've ever had. I'm serious, I've never had a hamburger taste this good. +++$+++ 1990s
I always wanted to go to Zegema Beach. +++$+++ 1990s
...we, we love her, Dick and me... +++$+++ 1980s
"Love your enemies"... +++$+++ 2000s
So why did you need the Addam's Family mansion for a scientific test? +++$+++ 1990s
Then I guess Walter can kiss that arm of his goodbye.  He don't use it for no good deeds anyway. +++$+++ 1990s
Can I hold him? +++$+++ 1980s
Y'know? I'm sure of it. Y'know? And there's a strong streak of goody- goody in him that is going to blow this deal for me if I don't do something about it.  Something! +++$+++ 1970s
I know your mad at me, okay, but I can't let you do this. +++$+++ 2000s
One of the plagues on members of Congress--office-seekers, cranks, people with pet bills. Get my son into West Point--or *outta* West Point. I've got a scheme to put people to work. How do I get rid of cockroaches? Some woman's composed a hymn to replace the Star Spangled Banner. Want to hear it? +++$+++ 1930s
Good morning to you, Mr. Delapot. +++$+++ 2000s
Why don't you just stick your finger in and stir it up. +++$+++ 1990s
Six rounds. 357. +++$+++ 1990s
I'm just going to get the name of their truck! +++$+++ 1950s
Police. They have their head in their asshole and they still can't find shit. +++$+++ 1990s
Oh, yes, that's right. +++$+++ 1960s
Stop it. +++$+++ 1970s
Congress has informed the army that it is bankrupt and cannot pay the soldiers pensions. +++$+++ 2000s
I'm not sure yet. I've had a shock recently, and I'm only beginning to get over it. Perhaps I'll go back to the convent one day. +++$+++ 1960s
Holy shit. That girl? +++$+++ 1990s
Git up. I got sump'n to show you. +++$+++ 1940s
I'll bet he's got an opinion on the stock market too. This apartment is already ahead of its time. I call it the "demolished" look. They've already heard about it at House and Garden and they're coming next week to photograph it before it gets... lived in. Is that alright? I'd love to have it in my portfolio. +++$+++ 1980s
You bet I've got a better offer. +++$+++ 1940s
AHHH!! The wine cellar!! In a bottle of Chateau Margaux. A metal cylinder... Don't... Don't - AAAAH! +++$+++ 1990s
Throw your gun down now! +++$+++ 1970s
For what? +++$+++ 1990s
I would not know. Maybe. +++$+++ 1990s
I think on account of his nose. +++$+++ 2000s
My writing career! Your hair written by Clementine Kruczynski.  The Tom Waits album is Rain Dogs. +++$+++ 2000s
A champagne cocktail, please. +++$+++ 1940s
How long you here, Joe? +++$+++ 1990s
I'm sorry... +++$+++ 2000s
There's a compass in the handle. +++$+++ 1980s
Sounds intriguing. +++$+++ 1990s
Aunt May, what happened? +++$+++ 2000s
What do you know about boats? I bet you can't even swim. +++$+++ 2000s
Yeah, just a nip. I feel like hell, all the carryings-on next door. +++$+++ 1990s
Where shall we go for dinner? +++$+++ 1950s
Well, thank you Mistuh Sleep 'N Eat. +++$+++ 2000s
Oz. +++$+++ 1990s
Jon, he's hooked up to a full-spectrum polygraph. No one has ever beaten -- +++$+++ 1990s
And yourself too in the process. God, you're so beautiful. Why couldn't I see that before? +++$+++ 1990s
Cause he was a liar. And I hated him.  "Get your head out of that machine, wise up to the real world." The more he mocked me the deeper I went. Cause if being savvy meant being like him --  Guess that's why I'm kind of clueless, even now. Didn't cultivate my conniving side. 'Not sure I even have one. +++$+++ 2000s
Yes? +++$+++ 2000s
As God is my witness, I have never done anything to that woman. +++$+++ 1990s
You won't be committing a crime. The man will cheat, you'll just be doing your job, that's all. +++$+++ 1990s
Watch out for that tree. +++$+++ 1990s
What about the rules? +++$+++ 1990s
I'm fine. Yes. I'm fine. +++$+++ 1990s
You feel? +++$+++ 1990s
"And her ritual feast continues as she prepares to make a sacrifice out of the seventh fiance.  So all bets are on and we hope that this boomerang bride isn't honeymooning with Las Vegas odds makers because many predict that this girl is out of there before the race... before the rice hits the ground"  Holy moly. +++$+++ 1990s
I'll get her.  Have a good Christmas, Matt.... +++$+++ 1980s
CARTMAN! +++$+++ 1990s
What? +++$+++ 2000s
Good day to you, M'Lords. +++$+++ 1990s
I have the letters right here. +++$+++ 1940s
Either it goes to Mitchell or it comes here. +++$+++ 1990s
A slight, a slight, well, no, we're gonna <u>deal</u> with it, we just, I need a little readjustment...we need to re<u>think</u>... +++$+++ 1990s
So, Mark's working at the State Department now. +++$+++ 2000s
Absolutely. +++$+++ 1990s
Sure, on me.  I got Diner's Club. +++$+++ 1970s
Wonder what's happened to Fenner. +++$+++ 1930s
Yeah. I'll go check on your boy. +++$+++ 1990s
Undoubtedly. Not the ascetics of course but, well Saint Thomas More... +++$+++ 1980s
Won't your father help you with that? +++$+++ 1990s
I will not have any damned ultimatums put to me, Lou.  I'll accept your resignation. +++$+++ 1990s
I reckon Mr. Woolridge got me hired on to work for Bill Cox's outfit. +++$+++ 1990s
I don't know.  It just woke me up. +++$+++ 1970s
They've never caught him before, what makes you think they'll catch him now? +++$+++ 1990s
Don't you dare touch me!  What the devil do you think you're doing? +++$+++ 1960s
Excuse me, Agent Mackelway? +++$+++ 2000s
That's the beauty of the system. This is a fugitive chat room. It moves from place to place, chat rooms that are normally empty at certain hours: a gardening website, Chaucer buffs, a dating service. A pre- arranged code shows up in one of fifty porn rooms -- that's where I stumbled across it -- notifying "friends" to meet at a certain time, usually midnight to three Eastern Standard, at a certain website -- a deserted chat room, say, "How to Plant Perennials." Come Tuesday, twelve a.m., bingo, these like-minded deviates log on and start yakking it up: explicit sex crime gossip, who did what to whom, who wants to do what, when, why and how. +++$+++ 2000s
Like Cocoa Puffs.  Good.  Captain Crunch.  Bad.  Shreds the roof of your mouth.  I mean you hear, "Tricks are for kids!"  And you think, "I'm a kid, I guess they're for me."  But your baby brain's got no idea that Fruit Loops are, like, a million times better.  I'm going to save our kid all that pain. +++$+++ 2000s
I give you my soul... +++$+++ 1930s
Non.  Please. +++$+++ 1990s
No, Mr. Lounds. You'll be just fine. +++$+++ 1980s
So do I. +++$+++ 1950s
What are your favorite buildings, David? +++$+++ 1980s
No, all the good ones are married. That's why Brad thinks he's God's gift to women. This woman anyway. He's single. He won't take no for an answer, but he's the only one who's asking. And he knows it. +++$+++ 1980s
Like gang-busters. Now, remember, if you don't want to go to jail, we gotta put your boss in jail. +++$+++ 1990s
How did it happen? +++$+++ 1990s
We can't be sure of that. +++$+++ 1940s
Yes laddie, I have her. +++$+++ 1980s
And this, only one of these letters, Major. I have lots of them. +++$+++ 2000s
Maybe you're right. +++$+++ 1980s
Good.  I've got a broken back from carrying you all these years anyway. +++$+++ 2000s
What does it look like I'm doing? +++$+++ 1990s
Yeah, you do that huckleberry. I'll still be here. +++$+++ 1980s
Yes, I could smell it on his breath, like I can on your's. +++$+++ 1990s
Laws don't touch men like Thaddeus Rains. Only justice does. +++$+++ 2000s
Me too. +++$+++ 1990s
I didn't shoot West... +++$+++ 2000s
I never thought it would end.  Then it did.  It was so great to be saved, I couldn't stop laughing. +++$+++ 2000s
Fine. We hit this bank. +++$+++ 2000s
That works on my nerves, you bein' so buddy-buddy with him. +++$+++ 1990s
You fucked up little prick! +++$+++ 1980s
Mr. President, the press guys asked if you could come back for a minute. +++$+++ 1990s
It was on your shirt! +++$+++ 1980s
It... was nothing.  A nightmare, nothing more.  Go away, I -- +++$+++ 1990s
Well, then, I--I *thank* you, Miss Saunders! Nothing better could have happened--. Yes *sir*, Miss Saunders, we're going right ahead with it! +++$+++ 1930s
One of yours? +++$+++ 1980s
Okay. +++$+++ 1970s
Why not? +++$+++ 1980s
I did that for your own good, fella.  Now I'm not going to pull rank on you.  When this is over, I'll be happy to step outside with you and settle this thing.  Right now my orders are to locate General Ripper and put him on the phone with the President. +++$+++ 1960s
Maybe because you're looking her in the face. +++$+++ 2000s
Right, right... +++$+++ 1990s
And what are you like? A wino? +++$+++ 2000s
How often is that? +++$+++ 1960s
Dil, this is Jude. +++$+++ 1990s
'Dem dat hides can finds says I'... I seen him, the clever tit, sneaking looks at it late at night, talking to it. +++$+++ 1970s
Wallowing in sin and lust... +++$+++ 1990s
You're really twisted, Gordon. You're incapable of giving to anybody because deep down inside you there's a poverty that every last dollar in the world won't fill. +++$+++ 1980s
Two years. +++$+++ 2000s
Eight and twenty-four. +++$+++ 1980s
Now you're talking... +++$+++ 2000s
Miss Clara's boy, Emory, to start with. The Johnson's Hocker was another one... +++$+++ 1990s
[What is his name?] +++$+++ 2000s
What about you? You haven't eaten in days. How come you're never on this side of the microscope? +++$+++ 2000s
No problem.  We're in. +++$+++ 1990s
I had immense plans. +++$+++ 1970s
It's a little late. +++$+++ 2000s
Which gives us about five hours. Why'd you call me? +++$+++ 2000s
Oh, I fell on my keys.  I've got to get out of here. +++$+++ 1960s
Get to what? +++$+++ 1940s
Enterprise maintaining full impulse power... +++$+++ 1980s
No, I mean if he can get in, maybe I have a chance. +++$+++ 1990s
You brought a fucking Pomeranian bowling? +++$+++ 1990s
I like banks.  That's where the money is. +++$+++ 1990s
From Interpol? +++$+++ 1990s
Majesty! +++$+++ 1980s
I'm really very sorry - I was banking on this coming through, because it's only five minutes from my surgery... +++$+++ 1990s
One guarantee.  Payment's entirely at your brother's discretion and, as a gift, dependent on your satisfaction. +++$+++ 1990s
I loved my taxi. Went twelve hours nonstop. Stopped only to pee. I peed under the Manhattan bridge. Peed many times in parks and playgrounds. +++$+++ 2000s
I can't handle that thing. +++$+++ 1980s
They are singing for me. +++$+++ 1950s
Since when?  Usually you leave 'em with nothing but a kick in the teeth. +++$+++ 1950s
I'd turn around, but I'm afraid you'd strangle me. +++$+++ 1980s
Al, as far as you're concerned, I'm the Don. +++$+++ 1970s
Mace, the guy had a knife.  To my throat.  In my living room. Relaxing might be right out, okay?! +++$+++ 1990s
Oh, here you are, Justice Zinnowitz -- I'm at cross-purposes with these gentlemen -- will you clear up the situation? +++$+++ 1930s
It's my belief that Dolores was doing exactly what she'd been doing for years.  Besides, the school board's insurance on Dolores is minimal.  A few million at the very most.  The really deep pockets are to be found in the town, or in the company that made the bus. +++$+++ 1990s
Okay. +++$+++ 1970s
He told me he was going to Hell. +++$+++ 1990s
So talk to me tomorrow.  After the gig. +++$+++ 1980s
Rod -- +++$+++ 1990s
Which way? +++$+++ 1980s
She's definitely part of this.  It's weird, for a while Ivy was all I could think about.  But then... +++$+++ 1940s
Lisa Fremont. +++$+++ 1950s
Dr. Argon, I demand an explanation. +++$+++ 1990s
His name is Frank. +++$+++ 2000s
How many points you got left on your license? +++$+++ 1990s
I'd like to use the sanitary facilities, if I may. +++$+++ 1970s
You'd think I was mad. +++$+++ 1980s
Give me the address. +++$+++ 2000s
Listen, what is this? What do you want? +++$+++ 1950s
Would you be willing to have dinner with me? +++$+++ 1990s
Darling, calm down. Why do you need a lawyer? Haven't you your little Volga boatman? +++$+++ 1930s
It will not be long before Longshanks too is encased in stone, and his crowns divided for others to wear. +++$+++ 1990s
Surely you know the one who made you... +++$+++ 1990s
Yeah.  Happening, isn't it? +++$+++ 1990s
When you need us, you love us, when you don't, we're shunned by the rest of the department. +++$+++ 2000s
How did you spot the ambush in Torrell? +++$+++ 2000s
...because if you don't, they die... +++$+++ 2000s
That what he says. Right? +++$+++ 1960s
How can I? You lied to me -- the way Charles did -- and after promising you wouldn't. Oh, I want to believe you, Peter... oh, but I can't call you that anymore, can I? It will take me a while to get used to your new name -- which I don't even know yet. What is it?  Aren't you going to tell me?  Hello -- ? +++$+++ 1960s
Now, Nuke, would I do a thing like that?  Hey kids, this is the great Ebby Calvin "Nuke" LaLoosh. +++$+++ 1980s
Diego is a bright boy -- a pleasure to teach -- but so serious... Brothers should be raised together, Colon.  Even brothers from different mothers... +++$+++ 1990s
You know, here we are having coffee together, and discussing education and business and economy...and we don't even know each other's names...full names I mean. +++$+++ 1980s
Thanks, but Miss Dawson and I are going out to see the sights. +++$+++ 1930s
Uh father, I know she's been through a lot... but the sacred stones..we don't have much time.. +++$+++ 1990s
Uh, narcolepsy. +++$+++ 1970s
Good hunting. Hayes out. +++$+++ 1990s
I want to be able to see us, Nick. I... I'm going to go into the bathroom now and put in my contacts, OK? Is that OK?  I want to be able to see us when we make love, OK? +++$+++ 1970s
Smart aleck! +++$+++ 1930s
We'll think of something. +++$+++ 2000s
You came out early. +++$+++ 2000s
I can and I am and I will - tomorrow! I gotta think about the little Wharvey gals! They look to me for answers! Vernon can s'port 'em and buy 'em lessons on the clarinet! The only good thing you ever did for the gals was get his by that train! +++$+++ 2000s
Will you meet with him? +++$+++ 2000s
Nothing.  It's just not there. +++$+++ 2000s
And what do you think you will find in another land? +++$+++ 1990s
Lord Nelson, Napoleon's troops.  I fear for the women and the property values. +++$+++ 1990s
I think it's time we got some professional help. +++$+++ 1990s
All right, but later. I've got a meeting now. +++$+++ 1950s
Baby, I'm in the middle of work. +++$+++ 1970s
I'm sorry. +++$+++ 1980s
What is it? +++$+++ 1990s
I gotta use the phone. +++$+++ 1990s
Who's your friend? +++$+++ 1980s
No -- +++$+++ 1990s
No! +++$+++ 1970s
Boys, boys... don't forget Russia is your mother country. Three sons walking out all at once... that's too much for any mother. +++$+++ 1930s
You're irresistible.  I lose control. +++$+++ 1980s
And God said to Avram, take yourself away from your land and from the place you were born and from your father's house into the land -- a different land -- and I will show you.... +++$+++ 2000s
Don't you have to finish the game ? +++$+++ 1990s
What a ridiculous thing to say. +++$+++ 1990s
Showing Vicki what she missed out on by being such a dull kid.  Now, the first thing you need in making a prank call is, of course, a phone.  This one, for instance. +++$+++ 1990s
Well, to tell you the truth, I'm having some trouble getting started– +++$+++ 1990s
Yeah. +++$+++ 1980s
Yes ... Tommy.  What are you doing here? +++$+++ 1990s
You don't really -- +++$+++ 2000s
INT. ICE CREAM TRUCK/BOX - DAY. +++$+++ 1990s
Thank you, sir. +++$+++ 1960s
I don't want to hear about your fucking dreams! +++$+++ 1980s
Do you know it? +++$+++ 2000s
What do you expect me to do about it? +++$+++ 1970s
Yeah, just started. +++$+++ 1940s
The law says people with disabilities cannot be terminated, so long as they can perform the duties required by their position... +++$+++ 1990s
You sure you know how to do this. +++$+++ 1980s
Got it. So take a walk, Ben... I'm going to borrow Susan for a second. +++$+++ 2000s
I know, I know--I have that dream all the time.  We're almost home. +++$+++ 1980s
I'm workin' on it. But she doesn't seem to be goin' for him. +++$+++ 1990s
And get a bunch of fools sniffin' around here? +++$+++ 2000s
I was not. +++$+++ 2000s
Hopefully the whole sad chapter is over.  And everyone, including your family, will find peace. WILL I just want to...thank all of you, for everything you've done for us. +++$+++ 1990s
It's actually been giving me Freddy nightmares. +++$+++ 1990s
And what do you do, Lucy? +++$+++ 1990s
You have a really nice place here...Paul. How much did you pay for it? +++$+++ 2000s
Ninotchka, you know I am your friend, you can trust me.... Did you bring back anything else? +++$+++ 1930s
Toys for... adults? +++$+++ 2000s
What'll I do if something comes up? +++$+++ 1930s
Ahh, there is yet time. +++$+++ 1960s
Oh, come on, we've seen it. I'm not in the mood to see a four-hour documentary on Nazis. +++$+++ 1970s
You're a couple o' sticks shy in your column, Ann. +++$+++ 1940s
The set-up is wrong.  We're doing all the legwork, and at the end of the day, we're still paying retail.  We're getting middled. +++$+++ 2000s
Incredible, isn't it? Well, I think John has had enough visitors for one day, Mothershead. I've got a lecture at the college, I'll be back this evening. +++$+++ 1980s
Thank God this plate was already fixed. +++$+++ 1990s
I know... +++$+++ 2000s
I know precisely where he'll be. +++$+++ 1990s
Andrew -- HOW DARE YOU!!  For all we knew, you were DYING!  Look at your mother -- she's still shaking! +++$+++ 1990s
Right. +++$+++ 1970s
You know what a hurry we're in. +++$+++ 1980s
Oh!  Oh, Zeke!  Help!  Help me, Zeke!  Get me out of here!  Help! +++$+++ 1930s
Give him the you-know-what. +++$+++ 1980s
From that moment on, I foresaw what I might be.  Already I felt the earth flee beneath me, as if I were being carried away up to the sky. +++$+++ 1990s
Let me come, too.  Please don't leave me alone. +++$+++ 1970s
Lizard DNA and human DNA on the same strand?  Impossible.  The sample must be contaminated. +++$+++ 1990s
Shopping, really? I should tell my friend. +++$+++ 2000s
I know.  Help me get a sample. +++$+++ 1990s
Well someone clearly let him out before Monica opened the gate. +++$+++ 2000s
I'm no spy -- where do I fit in? +++$+++ 1990s
Which is why I hoped you'd snub him. +++$+++ 1990s
This is the front entrance, right? You get through the slots, you hit craps here, not blackjack. Blackjack's here to here -- lined up. What's this, the cage? Cage is over there, hard to get to, you got it all mixed around -- +++$+++ 2000s
I'm not screwing around with you man...I hate the cold water. +++$+++ 1990s
Didn't ya think, Mary? +++$+++ 2000s
Way to go, Mom! +++$+++ 1980s
At last!   A call!  A cry of distress ...  Concorde!  Brave, Concorde ... you shall not have died in vain! +++$+++ 1970s
I could give it some thought, Ben, but my leg is very sore. +++$+++ 1970s
I don't know it was made out of driftwood and dipped in sulfuric acid.  It was out there... +++$+++ 1950s
I helped. +++$+++ 1990s
Hah! No, I'm not. Actually, I used to be, but the therapist I had was really ineffectual in helping me deal with my problems. Of course, I lied to him constantly, so I guess I can't hold him totally responsible... +++$+++ 1980s
No thanks. I had some. How would you like to take a walk for, say, half and hour? +++$+++ 1990s
Gatorade. +++$+++ 1990s
I... No. +++$+++ 1990s
End of the road, boys. It's had its twists and turns - +++$+++ 2000s
Well, Sammy's dead. Yeah, fell over in the bed with a chick twenty years younger than him. Had twenty-five grand in his pocket. +++$+++ 1990s
No. No. That's not it. We don't kill him. We don't kill anybody. But I like the way you're thinking. You're focused and you're trying to follow. No, what we need to do is start a fake Special Needs class. +++$+++ 2000s
I know. I write like a child. +++$+++ 1990s
I guess I would've felt sorry for the universe. +++$+++ 1990s
I hate sucking dick! +++$+++ 1990s
Listen to it, Brian... Jump when I say... It won't get us. +++$+++ 1990s
I don't want the job.  Don't do that to her.  She's worked too damned hard for it. +++$+++ 1990s
Okay. Tell me. What's the Five Point Plan? +++$+++ 1980s
Good thing in a situation like this. +++$+++ 2000s
I cannot, Athos.  Dearly as I love you, I cannot. +++$+++ 1990s
I think he's moved... +++$+++ 2000s
-- no -- Marie -- <u>no</u>! -- it's not like that -- +++$+++ 2000s
No further questions. +++$+++ 1980s
You wish to close this account today? +++$+++ 1990s
Well, I was thinkin' about smokin' actually... My mama smokes Marlboros now, used to be she smoked Kools? I stole 'em from her beginnin' in about sixth grade. When I got old enough to buy my own, I bought those. Now I've just about settled on Mores, as you probably noticed? They're longer. +++$+++ 1990s
Will you shut up... Just give me a drink. +++$+++ 1960s
Oh yeah? +++$+++ 1990s
It's further than I thought... a worm is sure to come....  I'll plant a thumper, that should divert it. -- Paul moves off into the shadows.  Suddenly, Jessica SEES a burst of LIGHTNING illuminate the mountain of rock in the distant and the vast dunes before them. +++$+++ 1980s
You know each other? +++$+++ 1990s
You and Kathryn gonna stay here? +++$+++ 1980s
He only appears to be inside the cage.  The point being... +++$+++ 1990s
Hey . . . hey. Where did the Building and Loan move to? +++$+++ 1940s
Wednesday next. Frank looks across the room at Jack. +++$+++ 1980s
I came to find my grandfather. +++$+++ 1980s
Oh, come, Madam -- please come. +++$+++ 1930s
You're going to have to stop this disturbance or I shall arrest you. +++$+++ 1980s
Malaysia's tanking.  We're meeting in ten in operations. +++$+++ 2000s
That bad? +++$+++ 1990s
Professor, what's the history of this house? +++$+++ 2000s
It's Grandma. I can't talk to her now.  I'm sorry, Grandma. +++$+++ 1980s
You're entitled. +++$+++ 1950s
L.A.P.D. +++$+++ 2000s
You and I should work together. +++$+++ 1940s
Then do you propose to arrest all of us, Citizen Lieutenant?  For I was not there alone. +++$+++ 1990s
Look at this.  An ambyloid reovirus protein.  That explains why the computer's confused.  The plant's infected with a virus. +++$+++ 1990s
At some point a man's got to get serious about his future. I'm sure you have no idea what I'm talking about. +++$+++ 2000s
Sit down! +++$+++ 1990s
If you say so. +++$+++ 1990s
I worked Vice, Narcotics... Violent Crimes... and I saw every known depravity.  I was lost, Mace.  In outer darkness.  Then I busted this strung-out little teeny-hooker. When I met Faith she was just another runaway giving twenty dollar blowjobs to buy crank.  Another lost soul. +++$+++ 1990s
Cool pictures.  You a fan? +++$+++ 1990s
Thank you. +++$+++ 1980s
I already told you I'm not. +++$+++ 1950s
Cancel lunch.  Make reservations at Campton Place for me and Mr. Butts. +++$+++ 1990s
What's all this for, more security? +++$+++ 1990s
Sorry, can you give us a moment? +++$+++ 2000s
Let's waste him.  No offense. +++$+++ 1980s
Besides, it's historically inaccurate. +++$+++ 1990s
He left the club with his girlfriend about midnight.  That's the last time anybody saw him. +++$+++ 1990s
Engine room! What's happening?! +++$+++ 1980s
Take my advice.  Get the hell out of there.  It's a bad place.  Always has been. +++$+++ 2000s
How many you see? +++$+++ 2000s
But there may be a few around somewhere. +++$+++ 1970s
And you play cricket?. +++$+++ 1990s
Cop. +++$+++ 2000s
So why're you even considering it? Are you? +++$+++ 1990s
Look, maybe I should just... +++$+++ 2000s
What do your friends call you? +++$+++ 1990s
God, I hope that thing didn't bring down a virus. +++$+++ 1990s
Christ, I smoke a pack-and-a-half a day, and I tell myself I could be worse.  It's just so damned pleasurable. +++$+++ 1990s
You can't just stay out half the night and carry on, Jeffrey. There's got to be some order, Jeffrey. I thought it would have been nice to call your father when you got home but now it is much too late. +++$+++ 1990s
'Respected journalist'-- On your knees... +++$+++ 1990s
I can't stand a voyeur. I'll be back. +++$+++ 1990s
Are you asking this committee to believe that you attended a meeting of a communist party front organization in order to impress a girl? +++$+++ 2000s
Shadow games ... +++$+++ 2000s
You know Rach, Discount Mart is having a sale on Halloween costumes. +++$+++ 1980s
You better check on it, Mr. Dunn.  I'll stay here and fly the ship. +++$+++ 1980s
Anything like work aroun' here? +++$+++ 1940s
It better be. +++$+++ 1990s
You're right. It's your version. You should come over to the studio sometime. +++$+++ 1990s
I used to go with him...I don't know where the hell he is.  I haven't seen him for two weeks. And I don't think I will.  He owes me money... +++$+++ 1980s
That's okay, you... we-we can walk to the curb from here. +++$+++ 1970s
I.. +++$+++ 2000s
Does Rachel make a lot of money? +++$+++ 1990s
No, there's no other way. +++$+++ 1960s
You're making it out like we're friends here or something. I met him alone twice. +++$+++ 2000s
That's good. That's very good. Now Harold, you go out and gas up the Ford, check the oil and tires, we don't want any problems on the road. One more thing... If anybody but you comes back... +++$+++ 1970s
Oh, are you a spy for the other side? +++$+++ 1950s
Then I'm glad I lost the bag! I'll write you the check immediately. +++$+++ 1930s
Yeah. A real tragedy. +++$+++ 2000s
Why didn't you mention it in your letters? +++$+++ 1980s
You should see the other bitch. What time you got? +++$+++ 1990s
Need any disks? +++$+++ 2000s
Of what? +++$+++ 1990s
I thought Heller was a double op? +++$+++ 2000s
Can I help you, Mrs. Argon? +++$+++ 1990s
It's nothing, Doc.  Just a... touch of indigestion... something. +++$+++ 1990s
You were great. +++$+++ 1950s
My husband didn’t need to slap me about, Mr Lombard. I volunteered... +++$+++ 1990s
Poor dear... Let's get you back in bed and I'll get them for you. +++$+++ 1990s
Hey Bob, come on! Talk to me hunh, it's your friend Red, I'm only asking you for three days chief... +++$+++ 1980s
Did you say..."Peggy"? +++$+++ 1980s
It's nothing - it just goes up - it's the safest thing in the world. Safer than a car.  Don't worry about it, Sal - it'll be all right ... they're great ... +++$+++ 1970s
Who are you? +++$+++ 1980s
Why? She's a junkie. +++$+++ 1970s
This the right place? +++$+++ 1980s
Did he ever mention specifically a girl or woman in New York? +++$+++ 1970s
I didn't protect him, lady. He trusted me. And I didn't protect him... His father...I lost his father to the streets and now, Chuy... +++$+++ 1990s
Hello. +++$+++ 1990s
He has a six months lease, and has used up a little over five and a half months of it.  Quiet. Drinks, but not to drunkenness. Pays his bill promptly, with money earned as a consume jewelry salesman -- wholesale. Keeps to himself, and none of the neighbors got close to him, or his wife. +++$+++ 1950s
What was that all about? +++$+++ 1990s
That depends on the man. +++$+++ 1990s
Yes? +++$+++ 1980s
Thanks. I thought I was gonna have to go to the hospital. +++$+++ 1990s
General Greene? +++$+++ 2000s
I'm going to stay with you until you fall asleep.  And then I'm going to get some brandy. +++$+++ 1990s
Jack. +++$+++ 1980s
Can't you? +++$+++ 1930s
Yes, sir. +++$+++ 1990s
For what? +++$+++ 1920s
You know. +++$+++ 1990s
Your what? +++$+++ 1990s
A doll? +++$+++ 1990s
Are you makin' fun of me --?  This is RIDICULOUS! +++$+++ 1990s
I understand.    I went to the Bar Association.  They tell me you're going to be disbarred. +++$+++ 1970s
Paisley Porter. +++$+++ 2000s
Tell me about them... +++$+++ 1990s
I don't care if you've got the Good Housekeeping seal of approval... I'm not looking for company. +++$+++ 1990s
I'd better go in. +++$+++ 1950s
Okay. +++$+++ 1950s
I'll make sure there's no kids left in the dorms... +++$+++ 1990s
It's my head, I'll be the judge of that. Anyway, who are you? +++$+++ 1980s
Yes, General. I am glad you came by. I overheard something that I think you should know about. +++$+++ 2000s
Any more ... +++$+++ 2000s
YOU'D fuck your uncle! +++$+++ 1990s
Yeah...I think they're just deciding what to do with us. +++$+++ 1980s
I love you dad. +++$+++ 1980s
You aren't staying? +++$+++ 1990s
That isn't true. +++$+++ 1990s
Diane 1. +++$+++ 2000s
I'm sure that ain't the only place he's sticking those pencils. +++$+++ 2000s
...using steroids.  I was a juicer. Diabonol, then, Wisterol -- it's for racehorses, for Christsake.  Now I'm bankrupt, divorced, my two grown kids won't return my calls... +++$+++ 1990s
That's new territory for us...but yes, we can look into that.  Explore shelter possibilities, funding bodies. we could - +++$+++ 1990s
Wait -- wait -- don't get up tight -- what I meant was we'd need a whole drum for that -- +++$+++ 1970s
Really -- you went with him for two years. +++$+++ 1980s
You better be, motherfucker. +++$+++ 1990s
What's that--detour? +++$+++ 1940s
No.  If you're smart, you run like hell. +++$+++ 1990s
You know where I'm from? +++$+++ 1990s
What time does the show go on? +++$+++ 1960s
The point is that she's upset. She's - and you got a fuckin' problem. +++$+++ 1990s
Is this 509-9027? +++$+++ 1990s
Splendid.  I'm actually in the stock- market, so not really similar fields, though I have done some amateur stuff -- P.G. Wodehouse, you know -- farce, all that.  'Ooh -- careful there, vicar.'  Always imagined it's a pretty tough job, though, acting. I mean the wages are a scandal, aren't they? +++$+++ 1990s
A magic dishcloth. +++$+++ 1980s
Can't you remember your own name? +++$+++ 2000s
One leg!  Like the Red Cross or something? +++$+++ 1990s
What about Neil? +++$+++ 1980s
More your line. +++$+++ 1990s
Look. That telegram was all scrambled. It was actually from Thompson, not to him. Western Union must have gotten the names reversed. I have to get going. I have to get out to the track. +++$+++ 1990s
Don't start. Look. +++$+++ 1960s
What do you want? +++$+++ 2000s
Well, Mr. Renton, I see that you attended the Royal Edinburgh College. +++$+++ 1990s
I have to leave now. +++$+++ 2000s
You scared me. +++$+++ 1990s
That's okay, that's okay, just shut the door. +++$+++ 1970s
Well that would be even better gossip. +++$+++ 1990s
So where are you now? +++$+++ 2000s
Yeah... +++$+++ 1970s
About two-thirty. +++$+++ 2000s
I can be real stiff. +++$+++ 1990s
Sorry. +++$+++ 1990s
Why don't he just tell 'em the truth? +++$+++ 2000s
She's got a juvenile record from New Orleans.  Parents died when she was 13. +++$+++ 2000s
What? +++$+++ 1990s
I was just looking at Carla's picture. +++$+++ 1950s
There was no plan! I was just young and stupid and scared! +++$+++ 2000s
So long, Colonel. +++$+++ 1970s
It's what he would have wanted, sir. +++$+++ 1990s
None at all? How about those 'underground' comics? +++$+++ 2000s
What are you then? +++$+++ 1960s
At the trial, you said you were at your apartment that night. Alone. +++$+++ 1980s
Don't crowd him. +++$+++ 2000s
He just did the Gettysburg Address in Sioux. What did he say? +++$+++ 1990s
Ever notice how cats always seem to turn up around dinner time? +++$+++ 1990s
Hiding. +++$+++ 1960s
You better watch your mouth, cunt, you're gonna get hurt. +++$+++ 2000s
Great.  Big ears, too? +++$+++ 1990s
Hey, no strings, right?  That's what you always said.  Just good pals who have the hots for each other. +++$+++ 1990s
Are you planning on working tomorrow? +++$+++ 1980s
Glad of it. +++$+++ 1990s
And that was only my first try. +++$+++ 1990s
It never ends. +++$+++ 1950s
You comin' in to hold my hand? +++$+++ 1970s
Yes you -- shut your mouth -- get out -- you're discharged. +++$+++ 1930s
Aye, that'll about do it. +++$+++ 2000s
Who? Some car hop, or a dress extra? +++$+++ 1950s
Thank you.  God bless you for helping us. +++$+++ 2000s
Sexual assault, Daryl.  Five years.  But you got lucky, right?  You got away with something else.  Something you figured nobody knows about. +++$+++ 2000s
You knew the arm slash was not "Zorro." +++$+++ 2000s
How should I know? "Solving a problem," I guess. Or needing to control everything. I don't know.  I've gotta get in there. +++$+++ 2000s
"Some prophet guy." And a city man. But he had to travel to the desert -- where there was quiet -- to hear the words of God. +++$+++ 2000s
The orbiting devices would be controlled from the point, then...? +++$+++ 1970s
Barnes believes in what he's doing. +++$+++ 1980s
Thanks for your help on the glasses thing. +++$+++ 1990s
--jeeeeeeeeesus-- +++$+++ 1970s
Toward the Pole! +++$+++ 1950s
Ah, the hair.  Blue, right? It's called Blue Ruin. The color. Snappy name, huh? +++$+++ 2000s
When I gave you my gun and you almost shot me. +++$+++ 1990s
How do you know he's dead? +++$+++ 1960s
So, do you enjoy being an actor? +++$+++ 1990s
No, you don't understand. It's here in these statues... +++$+++ 2000s
Please, the children. +++$+++ 2000s
Not unusual. +++$+++ 1970s
No, Doc, a private secret! It's perverted, it's pitiful. What am I -- Dr. Frankenstein? Aren't you repulsed? +++$+++ 1990s
Fine. +++$+++ 1990s
What time? +++$+++ 1980s
Very nice. What is it? +++$+++ 2000s
Yeah. He's knows of one all right. +++$+++ 2000s
Mama mia.  Just because you were a nerd once doesn't mean it's going to happen again. That's why you have me for fashion consultation. +++$+++ 1990s
Would you like a glass of tea or something? +++$+++ 1990s
Somethin' wrong with ya phone? Been callin' the last few days. +++$+++ 2000s
Do you want personal insights and adolescent secrets?  I don't do those. +++$+++ 1990s
Seventy-five. +++$+++ 1940s
Oh, there's no tellin' what that girl could've accomplished, and she never had it easy. Never really had a childhood... caring for her father, going to school. +++$+++ 2000s
Like how? +++$+++ 1990s
Look, I don't need to hear any of this working class hero crap. Some party boat skipper who's killed a few sharks... +++$+++ 1970s
It is kind of amazing. The dentist says she has perfect teeth, there isn't a cavity in her mouth. +++$+++ 1990s
Sandy, you have to chill out, at least two-thirds of the kids in our class are still virgins. He can't butcher all of us. +++$+++ 2000s
Say!  Do any of you guys know the Madison? +++$+++ 1970s
Yes. And tomorrow? I have a high maintenance selling painter coming through... So I'm out. Can you take him? +++$+++ 1990s
Yeah, we were just standing there. You said something about your shoulder hurting, then you just hit the ground like a sack of potatoes. +++$+++ 1990s
I did not get the report from an MI-6 agent. +++$+++ 1990s
Daya deo dono Dato.  Dalutan! +++$+++ 1990s
Oh? +++$+++ 2000s
What else did he tell you? +++$+++ 1940s
Do you understand why I came here? +++$+++ 1970s
Bob! I think I hear motors! +++$+++ 1930s
Hello? +++$+++ 1940s
Ally.  That's right. +++$+++ 1990s
You can't do this!  You owe me, O'Brien.  I made you plastic!  I made you! +++$+++ 1990s
Where are you going? +++$+++ 1970s
You want to be like that, Swann? Mud and shit? +++$+++ 1990s
Anything at all. I presume you won’t want to take the boy with you when you’re finished?  There’s a £500 fee for disposal. The boy is yours, you understand? +++$+++ 1990s
Bollocks, I’m sorry. I had no idea this would be so difficult. +++$+++ 2000s
Zeke. +++$+++ 2000s
Must be a garrison in town. We're in occupied territory, boys. +++$+++ 2000s
She was the one-- +++$+++ 1990s
There are complications. +++$+++ 1990s
See that tram coming around the corner? +++$+++ 2000s
It was. What sadness lengthens Romeo's hours?" +++$+++ 1990s
Don't count it. +++$+++ 1990s
Good. +++$+++ 1990s
He spoke to me. You want me to dis him? +++$+++ 2000s
It's OK.   It's good to let it out. +++$+++ 2000s
Just what the hell is wrong with you? +++$+++ 1990s
Great. Grab his feet. We'll throw him in the trunk. +++$+++ 2000s
July fourth weekend. Storm season starts today. The clouds roll in like clockwork. +++$+++ 1990s
Booo! +++$+++ 1990s
Man, I ain't ready to be goin' out nowhere -- +++$+++ 1990s
Fletcher, get away from there... +++$+++ 1990s
MPH RMPH RMPH RMPH RM!!! +++$+++ 1990s
I know, like five chickens had to die just so she could look that stupid. +++$+++ 1990s
You're looking magnificent, Leon...  ...isn't he, General Savitzky? +++$+++ 1930s
What the hell can I do? +++$+++ 1980s
You said it! +++$+++ 1930s
I can't believe you're doing this. +++$+++ 1990s
Are, too. +++$+++ 2000s
What's happened?  Kip!  What's happening? Don't shoot, please, don't shoot anybody. +++$+++ 1990s
His dream?  You can't control your dreams.  And you can't control your fears, can you? +++$+++ 1990s
No further questions. +++$+++ 1990s
All right, then. No more interruptions.  ... at noon, she met her subjects again. This time as their Queen. +++$+++ 1980s
No, no, what, what is it? +++$+++ 1990s
Das mussen sie doch wissen. Ich meine ohne grund wird die politzei doch nicht ins Hans komme Fraulein Schmidt, ein schande... +++$+++ 1940s
Then just help me find a girlfriend! That's all I ask. I'll give you every single card I've got left! +++$+++ 1990s
I've done the slut thing, David. It's really kinda old. +++$+++ 1990s
You! Activate circuits 29 through W7 and start Full Power Coordinates on Exterior Defensive Systems: +++$+++ 1980s
It's a romantic and tragic drink. +++$+++ 1980s
In private.  They got cameras and alla that crap in there. Microphones. +++$+++ 1990s
Al ???!!! +++$+++ 1980s
Maybe, but if you didn't I think you would have kept on walking. +++$+++ 1990s
Lava's hateable.  I never thought of that. +++$+++ 1990s
It's not the structure but the spirit which dwells within. There are three rooms and a kitchenette dedicated to hospitality. +++$+++ 1930s
I do the research. +++$+++ 1950s
Bite his ear! +++$+++ 2000s
Supposing he wants to get bad with us? +++$+++ 2000s
Well, she was a little upset at first, and that's why I thought you ought to hold your peace when you talked to your people last night...you did, didn't you, Louis? +++$+++ 1980s
The Kommandant also sends you clean blankets. He wants every man to have a new, clean blanket. +++$+++ 1950s
No, Sir. +++$+++ 1990s
How come ... ? +++$+++ 2000s
No you guys... Something happened... You guys wanna hear something creepy?  I don't think Kenny is dead. +++$+++ 1990s
No.  Look, we're kind of.... +++$+++ 1970s
Wha -- +++$+++ 1990s
Tell me about von der Null. +++$+++ 2000s
Write what you want. Just try not to make it so obvious that you're crazy about me. +++$+++ 2000s
Not everyone can have X-ray vision, you know. +++$+++ 1980s
Bad dreams? +++$+++ 1990s
Oh, it was...  ... Most of the time. +++$+++ 2000s
Jesus Christ is coming back and he's really pissed. +++$+++ 1970s
I don't know now. You-you wanna go to another movie?  So let's go see The Sorrow and the Pity. +++$+++ 1970s
No.  I don't think so. +++$+++ 1970s
I don't think we have anything to talk about. +++$+++ 1970s
We're on our way home. I just...we're running a little late. +++$+++ 1990s
I'm sorry, I'm not a weaver! +++$+++ 1990s
Is that what her daddy tells her? +++$+++ 1990s
We don't know. +++$+++ 2000s
It's . . . it's locked. +++$+++ 1970s
Wait up there, Claude. You give that guy your corn bread and the next thing you know you'll be ironing his shirts and clipping his toenails. +++$+++ 2000s
Hi. Hi Sandy. I'm sorry to bother you, but I've got to talk to you. +++$+++ 1980s
You are the Princess. +++$+++ 1990s
Yes - now let's see - where do you suppose the steward set it up? +++$+++ 1950s
--the crest of a lion and a dragon and a single word:  Courage. +++$+++ 1990s
How about me?  Do you think if I concentrated and put my whole soul into it, that some day I might be a putterer? +++$+++ 1930s
Mom, please don't start that again.... +++$+++ 1980s
Fantastic.  The Girlfriend Lottery. +++$+++ 2000s
Yours not to reason why, Miss Teschmacher. Relax! Enjoy it!  Just look at that smog! +++$+++ 1970s
What did I say? +++$+++ 1980s
Your hair looks so cute like that. +++$+++ 2000s
Boys just passing through? +++$+++ 1960s
Well, I got up one morning and went to work... just like any other day, except it was my first since hearing about the baby. And, I... I felt this fear and anxiety washing over me.  I looked around, and I thought, how can we raise a child surrounded by all this?  How can a child grow up here?  So, that night, I told her I didn't want us to have it, and over the next few weeks, I convinced her it was wrong.  I mean... I wore her down, slowly. +++$+++ 1970s
I've got you floored... We're off ... Take the curb... Man, can you corner... Know not to get on it ... Momentum shift ... Don't get on those brakes too hard ... Get her up on her tires. Up on her toes. Up ... Up... Up. +++$+++ 2000s
Like all living beings, Admiral each according to his gifts. The ship is yours. +++$+++ 1980s
Gee. You shouldn't take it so seriously, Jean. That's why you can't stop taking drugs. You always think people don't like you. Everyone likes you. +++$+++ 1990s
Almost. I figure we should find us a place to stay and then go eat. +++$+++ 1990s
I'll tell you another thing.  We might have led the world once into the Industrial Revolution, now we lead with television commercials. We're the best, it's as simple as that.  Even the Americans will admit it now ... the camera work, the acting, the scripts, special effects.  We've got the lot.  Nearly all the good directors here have ambitions to make serious films.  That food you're eating. +++$+++ 1980s
You're crazy to let go of a chick who calls you Lotte. I tell you that as a friend. +++$+++ 1990s
What're we going to do?! +++$+++ 1980s
I thought you were going to join us. Jesus, Garland, you left me alone with those people. +++$+++ 1990s
I want children, I want a family. But I don't know when. +++$+++ 1970s
... his snoring, yeah.  He says it's worse than ever.  That snaffle one...? +++$+++ 1990s
I had no thought of offending you, Oona. +++$+++ 1980s
You think Freeze will take the bait? +++$+++ 1940s
Yes I do. +++$+++ 2000s
Look at these people behind you. I'm totally convinced they're Satanists. +++$+++ 2000s
What...?  <u>Oh</u>. +++$+++ 1990s
Blackjack, Nick, blackjack I am good at. I mean, they'd give us some free games or something, wouldn't they? Since you worked there? +++$+++ 2000s
We can keep it in the bathroom. +++$+++ 1990s
What do you mean we. +++$+++ 1980s
Who is he? +++$+++ 1970s
I sure remember Tommy.  Mind if we talked about something else? +++$+++ 1980s
Get into business with this crew, identify them.  Illuminate their network.  If you're lucky, discover their source, how they penetrated us.  We'll indict and take it from there... +++$+++ 2000s
I'm glad you have such confidence in me. +++$+++ 1990s
There's Peggy with Michael Fitzsimmons. +++$+++ 1980s
So that the Old Mill, the Old <u>Mill</u> represents...the wheel of fate is that too... +++$+++ 2000s
Not that I'm glad you were sick, but I had a chance to do some thinking last night. +++$+++ 1980s
Yes. +++$+++ 1990s
What? +++$+++ 1980s
I was wondering. +++$+++ 2000s
You see what I see, Bork? +++$+++ 1990s
I've got eight hundred pounds. Oh Jesus. +++$+++ 2000s
See if they make sense.  To begin with, I think you should throw out all that psychological stuff -- exploring a killer's sick mind. +++$+++ 1950s
For Christ's sake, why not? +++$+++ 1990s
Troughed off. Protected. Like, you know, like he got a moat around it. +++$+++ 2000s
Gee! That musta been terrible.  I guess he had it coming to him though. But don't you worry about me. I don't talk. I never talk. Take my word for it. Gee, I wouldn't want anything to happen to my kids. +++$+++ 1930s
Hey... you got a minute? Hey. He's got two million in the box, am I right?  Okay, you let him keep your jewels. We take the cash and the only other thing he cares about.  Huh?  Her majesty. We go to Europe. You dye your hair, get some pl- +++$+++ 1990s
What are we going to do! +++$+++ 2000s
Not really. They just said it might be because we trained at Houston and they trained in Marshall, and that we're being charged against differ- ent accounting offices. +++$+++ 1960s
They were safe and could sleep. +++$+++ 1990s
No. +++$+++ 1930s
Aye.  And it is the trouble befallen us that brings me here.  I entreat you to tell me the cause of our surrounding sorrow, most lovely of the lovely. +++$+++ 1980s
Are you sure? +++$+++ 1990s
Those aren't guards.  They're valets. +++$+++ 1990s
They want to dump Tiger and have me endorse their damned chariot, right? They don't waste time... +++$+++ 2000s
That's better, but you've still got a long way to go.  Talk to Reiben, he's a natural and works at it, he'll give you some pointers. +++$+++ 1990s
I liked the bit you did about Baltic chastity belts. Too bad no one else did. +++$+++ 1980s
You don't understand! It's her father... +++$+++ 1990s
Hold on a sec.  Lois, you sure you wouldn't rather do this in the morning? +++$+++ 1990s
But he does seem familiar? +++$+++ 1980s
Aren't you worried you could die a virgin? +++$+++ 2000s
Give it back? Are you nuts? +++$+++ 2000s
Why should I? We're happy, aren't we, darling? +++$+++ 1930s
Shit. You're not planning -- +++$+++ 1990s
Why are you doing this to me? I'll give you whatever... +++$+++ 1980s
You can't believe how much he's improved. +++$+++ 1990s
Dark Valdez. +++$+++ 1970s
Nothing.  That's all I can say. +++$+++ 1990s
You can see the outline of a butt. +++$+++ 2000s
I guess what I mean is, my mother married my dad after you...and then I was born, so I thought that...maybe you got divorced because of me. +++$+++ 1990s
I'm going to make this Ms. Pauline thing work. Lines of communication between the cliques. You were a phase.... +++$+++ 1980s
What? +++$+++ 1970s
How do you know she is a witch? +++$+++ 1970s
Sure. Hey, but the biggest thing I didn't tell you . . . +++$+++ 1940s
When I came upstairs, you stayed to finish your drink. I told you to turn off the TV when you were through.  Come to think of it, I also told you you could sleep in the maid's room. +++$+++ 1990s
Please hurry. +++$+++ 1980s
Okay. Make me an isosceles. +++$+++ 2000s
Joanna said that? +++$+++ 1970s
I'm game.  Sure. +++$+++ 1990s
Oh no!  We can't fight this thing! There's only six hours of air left -- we're dead men! +++$+++ 1970s
Trade Re1ations. +++$+++ 1990s
Well, this might come in handy. +++$+++ 1940s
You're a very intelligent girl, Tracy. You have many admirable qualities.  But someday maybe you'll learn that being smart and always being on top and doing whatever you need to do to get ahead, and yes, stepping on people to get there, well, there's a lot more to life than that.  And in the end, you're only cheating yourself. +++$+++ 1990s
Ah, ya know.  Neighborhood's not what it used to be.  Kid no more'n five swiped a candy bar the other day. +++$+++ 2000s
Wait a second Sid. Don't you go jumping the gun. You haven't seen the best part.  With the aides of the computer revolution of y2kI've been able to steal your voice.  Ain't it cool? Listen to what the police are gonna find next to your lifeless, mutilated body. +++$+++ 2000s
Oh, perfect!  He reminds me of Ichabod Crane.  His Adam's apple keeps jumping up and down whenever he gets excited. HANNAH  Listen.  He's a lot better than your ex-husband.  He's got a good job.  Would you light those, please? He's-he's-he's not a dope addict or anything. +++$+++ 1980s
What do you mean?  You gambled it? +++$+++ 1990s
"Dad." +++$+++ 1990s
Uh, ninety days. And now I just have to go once a week. See, I'm rehabilitated. +++$+++ 1990s
My clothes have always been perfectly serviceable. +++$+++ 1990s
But how are we gonna -- +++$+++ 1980s
I don't know, the attorney gen... the...some consumer office, um... +++$+++ 1990s
Free-lance?  Oh really?  You think I don't see?  You think I took vows yesterday?  I know what you're up to. You and Reverend Mother. +++$+++ 1990s
Gee, Eddie, I'm a rabbit.  We always run. +++$+++ 1980s
Where you going? +++$+++ 1950s
I know.  It sucks.  I suck. +++$+++ 1990s
What are the doctors saying? +++$+++ 2000s
What's the matter?  What's the matter with you?  You look pale.  You okay? +++$+++ 1980s
Later. +++$+++ 1980s
But, we had requested -- we were hoping to take her back to Genesis... +++$+++ 1980s
We felt his presence. +++$+++ 1980s
Tommy.  Come on. Relax. +++$+++ 1990s
Is it familiar? Have you been here before. +++$+++ 1980s
Donna, are you my best friend? +++$+++ 1990s
That would give us only three seconds to revive him... +++$+++ 1960s
What? +++$+++ 1990s
And co. A lot of co. Oh, God, I've thought about you so much. +++$+++ 1990s
It's a good one all right. +++$+++ 2000s
What makes you so sure he's the one? +++$+++ 1980s
Do you want something to drink? +++$+++ 2000s
That's it, man.  That's the whole story. +++$+++ 1990s
I deduced it. Once you walked in. +++$+++ 2000s
Okay. +++$+++ 1950s
What's going on? +++$+++ 2000s
Yeah, thanks for everything. +++$+++ 1980s
But it didn't stop. I know it didn't stop. Granny told me it didn't. +++$+++ 2000s
Tiger's challenged you and Jerses has made me an offer, made us both an offer:  you take a fall. +++$+++ 2000s
Yeah. +++$+++ 1980s
That's in Maverick County. +++$+++ 1990s
Yeah. +++$+++ 1980s
Maybe, yeah.  Hell, I don't know. +++$+++ 1990s
On what charge? +++$+++ 2000s
B:  Ryan is dead.  He's been blown up by the German equivalent of Wade, whose name I know you don't want me to mention.  There's nothing to find. The biggest piece is the size of a pea.  We wander around, looking for him until the Germans pick us off, one after another. +++$+++ 1990s
So you have the answers... +++$+++ 1990s
I guess not Cooper... +++$+++ 2000s
What's on the call sheet? +++$+++ 1990s
Try a year and a half. He bands her an old snapshot. PILAR looks at it-- +++$+++ 1990s
Wow... +++$+++ 1990s
How do I know that? How about it, pretzel-man? What's your story? +++$+++ 1990s
No oxygen to the brain. +++$+++ 2000s
Why'd they break off?  Was there water in that canyon? +++$+++ 1950s
Class of eighty-six!  I didn't know you were there. +++$+++ 2000s
Okay. +++$+++ 1990s
How many were there? +++$+++ 1990s
Yes. Uh, how will we recognize this Doctor Schneider when we see him? +++$+++ 1980s
No!  Tis not the time!  I want no part of your frolic. +++$+++ 1980s
Whoa.  No shit. +++$+++ 2000s
I pose an unacceptable danger to the public, remember? +++$+++ 1990s
I believe the beverage has provoked an emotional response. +++$+++ 1990s
It's like jelly. +++$+++ 1990s
I do know.  Be two places at once... learn to hit a baseball or turn a cartwheel... eat breakfast with chopsticks... +++$+++ 2000s
Ease off, John .. +++$+++ 1990s
Half the time he's bluffing. +++$+++ 1980s

Blood . . . my . . . blood . . . +++$+++ 1980s
He has a big mouth.  Yes!  It seems to me I did read something about that incident as a student.  But you have to remember that a worm -- with very few exceptions -- is not a human being. +++$+++ 1970s
Don't strain yourself. +++$+++ 1980s
I was fired by Wyant Wheeler. I plan to bring a wrongful termination suit against Charles Wheeler and his partners. +++$+++ 1990s
Gotta find me first, you pansy-assed Mama's boy. +++$+++ 1990s
Buzz has been moving the cash out in hollow bowling pins. Sid and Breeze throw sideways glances at each other. +++$+++ 1990s
Everyone else was wrong and the one fucking lunatic was right! +++$+++ 1980s
Andrew hardly needed leading.  He was a very passionate man.  He was eager to explore.  I gave him what he wanted.  We fulfilled each others needs. +++$+++ 1990s
Yes, sir. Rubinstein takes out a notebook. +++$+++ 1970s
What about rule number three: Don't get involved with dispatchers named Love. +++$+++ 1990s
-- watch the mouth, homeboy, I don't need to hear that word -- +++$+++ 1990s
I can't work this. +++$+++ 1990s
I have... eight-fifteen. That's not right, is it? +++$+++ 2000s
I didn't know you were so kinky. +++$+++ 1990s
Not mad. +++$+++ 2000s
Yes, absolutely. Is there a ballet in Figaro? +++$+++ 1980s
Directory enquiries. Can I help you? +++$+++ 1990s
I know it, son. But tonight's going to be even tougher. +++$+++ 1970s
What... does he... look like? +++$+++ 2000s
We drugged her.  So she wouldn't remember. +++$+++ 1920s
Where is she? +++$+++ 2000s
See here, child, when you have this pain in your back, where is it? +++$+++ 1940s
Looks like weather. +++$+++ 1990s
Thank you, Kenny. +++$+++ 1990s
Ruth's already taken him home. +++$+++ 2000s
Huh? +++$+++ 1990s
Exactly!  We've got to take the war to them.  Hit 'em where it hurts -- right in the nuts.  More assassinations, more killings.  Right, Al? +++$+++ 1990s
It's all, gone wrong, nothing's working out. +++$+++ 1980s
He's doing the same thing you did to him, playing Letterman on TV. +++$+++ 1990s
What do you mean?  What happened! +++$+++ 1990s
OH.  "I'm a Yankee Doodle Dandy, Yankee Doodle is my ... " Listen, this is not place to talk.  Come! +++$+++ 1960s
They're in 7D. +++$+++ 1990s
Yeah +++$+++ 1990s
Oh! +++$+++ 1930s
What?  We both have cars. +++$+++ 1990s
We go underwater? +++$+++ 1990s
Good night, Steve. +++$+++ 1940s
Does he have to stay here over night? +++$+++ 1990s
Did you knock on the door yet? +++$+++ 1990s
Like if something happened to him, he could still get us. +++$+++ 1990s
You thought wrong. I haven’t seen Leon for months. +++$+++ 1990s
Yes, sir. +++$+++ 1930s
What do your friends call you?-- The ones that know you well?--and like you very much? +++$+++ 1990s
It was blown up with the plane. +++$+++ 1990s
How 'bout the tree? You want the tree? +++$+++ 2000s
You think this is the guy who did it? +++$+++ 1980s
They killed her.  And they're trying to buy it... +++$+++ 1970s
Do you ever get like the slightest inkling that you might want to help me instead of doing absolutely nothing? +++$+++ 2000s
Norman Cay is not a person.  He is an island, George.  In the Bahamas.  From what they say, it is free and it's Diego's new home. +++$+++ 2000s
I think I'm gonna have a fucking heart attack. +++$+++ 2000s
And what would this be, Sweet and Low? +++$+++ 1990s
I don't even know why I'm afraid, Uncle Charles. I can't even remember when it started. Don't you think it's time I found out and got over it? +++$+++ 1980s
...the Suitcase Bomb.  ACT ONE Albania denies it. President comes on the air, "Be Calm."  Okay, now: Good.  Now, Alright.  Act <u>TWO</u>...  I need the following here.  Right now:  Johnnie Green, Liz Butsky, and get me the Fad King. +++$+++ 1990s
Oh Christ. Julia... +++$+++ 1980s
A Jedi's power is measured by the amount of the Force that is stored within him, and I have little of the Force left in me. +++$+++ 1970s
"60 Minutes," the television show? +++$+++ 1990s
Hurry, Sister! +++$+++ 1990s
Look at it this way, it's their contribution. If we'd explained it to them, they'd probably have given it to us anyway. +++$+++ 2000s
Yes, this is Doctor Marrow. +++$+++ 1990s
I know it's you, Grady, I just... Christ, Grady, do you know what time it is? +++$+++ 2000s
You're so far off!  Hal... Hal Sinclair... your co- star.  Remember now?... No, I don't think he's put on weight.  Anyway, you think he's right for "Eternity Forever"?... not the right type?... a different direction...  I'll try to talk her into it. +++$+++ 2010s
Water? +++$+++ 1990s
My office will fill him in and help expedite.  Look forward to meeting you at the proper time.  Jumping off now... +++$+++ 1990s

Well, he's succeeded in impressing half the world. +++$+++ 1940s
... is that I sent them here. I told them she came here sometimes. With her dirtball boyfriend. That's exactly what I said. +++$+++ 2000s
Actually, I had a crash course from my mother the night before my prom. +++$+++ 1980s
How much? +++$+++ 1990s
Tell her you need to see her. +++$+++ 1990s
All of it. +++$+++ 1970s
Sure. +++$+++ 1990s
Sure will, pal, sure will. +++$+++ 1990s
Goddam right. +++$+++ 1980s
He was hot, wasn't he? +++$+++ 1980s
The guy was history when he killed Kelly.  You knew that. +++$+++ 1990s
Smile, little sister, smile. +++$+++ 1980s
Wendy... How would you like to go get some ice cream? +++$+++ 1990s
Um--hello? You want to like take a look? +++$+++ 1990s
Who is this guy, anyway? +++$+++ 2000s
I'm for that. +++$+++ 2000s
Okay... +++$+++ 1990s
Your father is Julian Cross, isn't he? +++$+++ 1970s
I'll always go back to that church. +++$+++ 1990s
I am not!  I'm a terrible mother! I'm an awful mother.  I yell at him all the time.  I have no patience.  No...No.  He's better off without me.  Ted, I've got to go...I've got to go. +++$+++ 1970s
What are you asking me? +++$+++ 2000s
What does it mean? +++$+++ 2000s
It's a miracle. +++$+++ 1980s
What? +++$+++ 1990s
Hey look.  You think I'm gonna run out on ya or somethin'?  Just cause we hit it big.  Luther, I owe you everything.  If you hadn't taught me con, I wouldn't know nothin'. +++$+++ 1970s
There always are.  But there are also three men and three guns. Matched forensically.  A few loose ends don't matter. +++$+++ 1990s
Sustained. +++$+++ 2000s
God, I haven't seen you all day. +++$+++ 1990s
Ok, well, travel safely. See you soon. +++$+++ 2000s
Meet me at 4:01, top of the run. That'll give you a minute to freshen up. +++$+++ 2000s
Yes. +++$+++ 2000s
Yes. But my boss reckons you’d still be better off as a limited company. For expenses and all that, you know? It’d cost you about £100 but he said it’d be worth it.  Of course, you’d need a partner to register. But that’s a formality. I mean, I could be your partner. I mean, just as a name, right? +++$+++ 1990s
"...especially Spencer's Theorem..." +++$+++ 2000s
You're sure?  There was nothing? +++$+++ 2000s
I'll tell you how come.  The Barrack Chief gave them the green light. And you, our Security Officer, said it'd be safe. That's how come. +++$+++ 1950s
Sure I'm insane, but I've got some good news for you.  This magnolia is leaving your sweet smelling vanilla joint. This bird in a cage is gonna button his own pants from now on. And that is what is known as telling the mother- in-law. +++$+++ 1930s
Okay. He's driving along and this fuckin' cat jumps in front of his car, and so he hits this cat-- +++$+++ 1990s
I understand sir.  Could you slide your shorts down please? +++$+++ 1990s
Damn skippy. He like it, too. +++$+++ 1990s
But what? +++$+++ 1970s
Time out. +++$+++ 1990s
Yes, I do. +++$+++ 1970s
You heard voices, you know you did. +++$+++ 2000s
Hal will have my head for this. +++$+++ 1990s
Good. Good. Do not let Vig out of your sight. +++$+++ 2000s
I mean, listen, two people don't get along, at some point you gotta call it... I mean, it's none of my business, but I ... I think that's what you gotta do. You gotta take it somewhere - +++$+++ 1990s
I bribed the Minister of Health to have you transferred to Kigali. +++$+++ 2000s
Good.  So shall we leave it at that then? +++$+++ 2000s
But what did he see that made him panic? +++$+++ 1980s
Just do it. +++$+++ 2000s
That's me. +++$+++ 1990s
Like it were a piano? +++$+++ 1990s
Not a lot of difference. +++$+++ 1990s
Oh God Veronica, my afterlife is s-o-o boring. If I have to sing "Kumbaya" one more time... +++$+++ 1980s
When? +++$+++ 1980s
He divorced his wife -- he married Marylin -- he divorced Marylin -- and he -- remarried his WIFE? What kind of sick -- +++$+++ 2000s
He's a lucky man.  Do I know him? +++$+++ 1990s
Trust is something you earn, over time. You don't just inherit it overnight like a gazillion dollar empire. +++$+++ 2000s
Yes.  Don't hurt me. +++$+++ 1980s
Well you guess what.  The Mayor sent me. I have your Mr. Barrenger with a history of... +++$+++ 2000s
We have some unfinished business. +++$+++ 1980s
You'd drifted right through the core systems.  It's blind luck that deep-salvage team caught you when they...are you all right? +++$+++ 1980s
That you left? or that you didn't say 'goodbye'? +++$+++ 1970s
Before he can get there here comes this Federal Marshal, and Franky's indicted for Jury tampering, they throw him in jail, he's gonna be disbarred, his life is over.   Jimmy, gimme another drink.    How are you? +++$+++ 1970s
Hello, Neo. +++$+++ 1990s
She's <u>dying</u> and <u>Rache</u> is your mother now! +++$+++ 1990s
This is the right day. +++$+++ 1950s
Yes. +++$+++ 1980s
Since when did you drink diet soda? +++$+++ 1990s
I don't want to go that way.  Find a way that we don't have to go through Texas. +++$+++ 1990s
Okay...don't forget to get another therapist for next week. +++$+++ 1990s
Hey, tabloids paid Ted Bundy - famous serial killer - half a million for his interview.  And how much you think Monica got for writing book about the President coming on to her?  It pays to be a killer or a whore in this country. Look, you want magazine or not? +++$+++ 2000s
Fine.  Have them do some. +++$+++ 1980s
My Lord, enemy commander wishes a truce to confer. +++$+++ 1980s
A single hour. +++$+++ 1970s
Oh, no! She hasn't been here at all! I would have seen her, you know. I've been right here all the time, putting olive oil on my rubber plant leaves! +++$+++ 1950s
I'm crucifying him. +++$+++ 1930s
What happened? +++$+++ 1980s
I don't know why she bought me a tie! -- She's a generous person -- and she's a nice person -- and I could be settin' her up to be killed... you want the fuckin' tie? +++$+++ 1980s
No. +++$+++ 1980s
Oh, man! +++$+++ 1990s
What'd I tell you? +++$+++ 1980s
I hit him from the floor with everything I knew! +++$+++ 1930s
I mean, I don't know, he's seeing someone else or something, but... +++$+++ 1980s
Somebody better tell me what's going on and tell me fast! I can take so much and then... +++$+++ 1960s
Think you can narrow it down for me. +++$+++ 2000s
Four minutes. +++$+++ 1990s
Right here, Mom... +++$+++ 1990s
Who, for instance? +++$+++ 1930s
Ahm.  That thing I was doing tonight -- I'm not doing it any more.  I told them I had to spend the evening with Britain's premier equestrian journalist. +++$+++ 1990s
Boy, don't you hate it when that happens? +++$+++ 1990s
No, no, I-I-i, uh, I don't use any major hallucinogenics because I took a puff like five years ago at a party and +++$+++ 1970s
Oops! Time for class. Meet me after? On the benches? +++$+++ 2000s
It isn't safe for you to remain in this area. +++$+++ 1990s
No -- +++$+++ 1990s
We'll bring them up just like we brought you. It's called a transporter beam... +++$+++ 1980s
What's wrong with your hand? +++$+++ 1990s
We take a weeny little wedge, bang on it a couple of times, and bust off a chunk of the metal.  Yet any spacecraft -- even at a low velocity, say 200 miles an hour -- crashes into the water -- it's gonna be like hitting concrete, it would crumple like paper.  But there isn't a dent to be seen anywhere.  Not even a scratch. +++$+++ 1990s
-- Price killed her, there's no other explanation -- +++$+++ 1990s
Where is the little lady? +++$+++ 1990s
A recoil, with no compensating mechanism. +++$+++ 2000s
I'm going with the patrol boat to make a tour around the islands. +++$+++ 1960s
HELLLPPP! +++$+++ 2000s
You were wrong, it did hurt. +++$+++ 1970s
Look are you just fiddling around with me or what? +++$+++ 1980s
I mean do you feel like telling me what were the circumstances? +++$+++ 1960s
What's the matter? +++$+++ 1940s
You seem to have an answer for everything. +++$+++ 1990s
Jasper Lamar Crabb? +++$+++ 1970s
I cannot tell a lie. +++$+++ 1980s
The Farpoint mission? Data, that was seven years ago. +++$+++ 1990s
Don't kill me. Oh shit, please no. I'm Rocco. I'm the funny man!... the funny man... the funny. +++$+++ 1990s
Think I should put the skateboard in bed with him? +++$+++ 1980s
Yes. +++$+++ 1990s
I hope so. Is that the end then? +++$+++ 1970s
Pleasure. +++$+++ 1990s
You'd better try to get some sleep, Bob. +++$+++ 1930s
Ha ha ha! +++$+++ 1990s
Yes.  Fine. +++$+++ 2000s
Yeah, Boss? +++$+++ 1940s
V'ger travels to the third planet to find the Creator. +++$+++ 1970s
Joe, don't do this -- +++$+++ 1990s
Eighty cents a word--three--six--nine words. That'll be seven twenty, but it's too much--I'll show you how to save some money. +++$+++ 1930s
What about Fleur-de-Lis?  Their slogan's 'Whatever you desire.' +++$+++ 1990s
Excuse me... +++$+++ 1990s
Jani! Where are you? +++$+++ 1990s
Now you've fallen into his trap. When he goes to bed at night Burgel dreams of inspiring as much fear in others as they inspire in him. +++$+++ 1990s
-- I guess you haven't. +++$+++ 1990s
Don't give me that preoccupied scientist crap.  I'm trying to get ready for.... +++$+++ 1980s
Walter-- +++$+++ 1990s
I'm not a lonely spooky writer like you. Nursing a hundred grudges. I'm a man who loves life. +++$+++ 2000s
Hi--!  The gun was empty! +++$+++ 1990s
No argument. +++$+++ 1980s
Mmm.Hmmm. +++$+++ 1990s
Tell your mother. +++$+++ 1990s
I hope so, too. +++$+++ 1940s
I'm really tired, Dad... can I just go to sleep? +++$+++ 1990s
I tried to grab you -- save you -- +++$+++ 1990s
Yeah. +++$+++ 1990s
No baby.  I'm serious.  Cancel that meeting.  I got more fruit that needs checking.  Come home with me now. +++$+++ 2000s
It's too late... We already tested it on Organa Major.  It appears your data never got through. +++$+++ 1970s
Come on speak up, Gooding, I'm trying to run a business here. I can't have people flipping out in the break room when they should be slaving away at their desks. +++$+++ 2000s
How'do. +++$+++ 1950s
Solid rocket fuel at twenty-five thousand kilograms... +++$+++ 1990s
Oh darling -- is that for me? +++$+++ 1990s
I thought maybe you just came for the ride. +++$+++ 1990s
What are we doing here? +++$+++ 1990s
How come that's all you talk about anymore ? +++$+++ 1990s
It's sinking, Harold. Going over the horizon - where we are all going to go. It's getting dark. "Let each man hold on to his candle and get a light where'er he can." +++$+++ 1970s
But I might not have. +++$+++ 2000s
I said keep your nose out of my life. No kid is going to tell me how to run it. +++$+++ 1940s
Yes. +++$+++ 2000s
In the back...feels like an arrowhead. +++$+++ 1960s
Because I think you're writing on spec and with a first person interview, you might actually sell that thing. +++$+++ 1990s
The Torah says not to light a fire on the Sabbath, because it's work, correct?  But if alternating current's running through the wires every second of every day, and I throw a switch, send it here instead of there, how is that lighting a fire? +++$+++ 2000s
You know, when you dumped me for that wimp, I thought, Cole, she'll be back. God wants the two of you to be together, and sure enough... +++$+++ 1980s
He certainly could. About a month. +++$+++ 1940s
It's PG&E saying to the judge that we don't have a case.  Their lawyers go -- +++$+++ 2000s
You want to bet? +++$+++ 1990s
Looks like he planned, something. He shut up his apartment and his shop. +++$+++ 1930s
Psst! Hey, Martini, wake up! +++$+++ 1970s
Oh, Kyle. +++$+++ 1980s
Shh.  It's okay. +++$+++ 2000s
That's right. +++$+++ 1960s
We don't know of anything, Master... +++$+++ 1960s
Will the Senator yield for a question? +++$+++ 1930s
I guess living up here makes people look older. +++$+++ 1990s
turns around and Juliet presents her with a brown paper bag. +++$+++ 1990s
No. +++$+++ 1990s
Maybe six months with good behavior.  One to five. +++$+++ 1970s
It is possible the French authorities will find a reason to put him in the concentration camp here. +++$+++ 1940s
Todd, if you're gonna make it around here, you've gotta speak up.  The meek might inherit the earth but they don't get into Harvard. know what I mean? +++$+++ 1980s
Oh no.  Look -- I like you. I wouldn't keep coming here if I didn't like you. +++$+++ 1960s
I am not mad. +++$+++ 1930s
They'll shoot you, Animal! +++$+++ 1950s
He's your brother, you figure it out.  Maybe he made another bomb. +++$+++ 1990s
If I had to guess by your eyes, I'd say you were fifty. +++$+++ 1990s
Didn't know I needed a reason to come home. +++$+++ 2000s
Wrong. That is flat out wrong. Hell is for cowards, for hypocrites who fear to live by the strenght of their own convictions. This is war. Given the circumstances, and given the fact that we are alive and they are not, we have chosen life over death. Two wrongs don't make a right. So our conviction and execution would only mean more death here, not less. +++$+++ 1990s
We were called in by the Jerome base... +++$+++ 1990s
No we don't. +++$+++ 1960s
Frank would open you. +++$+++ 1990s
This must be some important boat. +++$+++ 2000s
I'll show you the cabin. +++$+++ 1960s
Because... +++$+++ 1990s
Can I look for myself? +++$+++ 2000s
Then, I need you.  We all do. Without your victory the men would have no hope at all. +++$+++ 2000s
Were <i>you</i> alone? +++$+++ 1990s
Honors -- hup! +++$+++ 1980s
The reason why I wanted to take a walk, Mary, is 'cause I wanted to talk to you. +++$+++ 1930s
Where's Regan's father? +++$+++ 1970s
Oh no; quite the contrary. He's really just a child. +++$+++ 1960s
I go home and paint the kitchen. +++$+++ 1990s
It's oregano.  You got ripped off, pal. What are you gonna do with all this? +++$+++ 2000s
And you missed this?  How are you going to miss something like this? +++$+++ 1990s
We just have to make a new beginning. +++$+++ 2000s
Yeah.  I'm not trying to replace your Dad... or steal your Mom.  I just want to be your friend. +++$+++ 1980s
You don't understand. +++$+++ 1990s
Who? +++$+++ 1990s
That happens to be the truth. +++$+++ 1930s
Oh.  Congratulations. +++$+++ 1990s
Nova, yeah she looked pretty sweet. +++$+++ 2000s
Because mother read it in a book somewhere, and if mother's little darling doesn't take her fingers out of the salad bowl this instant, mother's going to wring her little neck. +++$+++ 1930s
But I won't. +++$+++ 1960s
But I don't want to go, I am enjoying it. +++$+++ 2000s
I'm Taryn White.  I only came here because it was a better deal than juvie hall.  Also, I guess 'cause I'm going through some very stange shit. +++$+++ 1980s
Yeah, thanks. +++$+++ 1990s
I don't know. +++$+++ 2000s
No other aspiration? +++$+++ 1990s
-- I guess I just blocked it out, that's all. +++$+++ 1970s
And my passport? +++$+++ 1940s
Come around to the cigar store tomorrow morning at ten o'clock and we'll talk about it, okay? We'll see what we can work out. +++$+++ 1990s
Knox, you are so infuriating! +++$+++ 1980s
You can let go. +++$+++ 2000s
Surely you'll grant me a final word. +++$+++ 2000s
What! +++$+++ 1970s
Aaah ... stop picking on me... you're as bad as the rest of them. +++$+++ 1960s
What, did you see it work in some movie you got beat up in? +++$+++ 1990s
They were inside.  They booby trapped her apartment! +++$+++ 2000s
That bum.  So what if he has a Porsche, he can't treat you like that...it's Friday night for crissakes. +++$+++ 1980s
You pathetic piece of shit. I can say whatever the fuck I want and you won't have a clue, you fucking retard. +++$+++ 2000s
Tim, you're gonna have to let go.  I'm going to count to three. +++$+++ 1990s
That's right, Mr. Stone -- there is --  -- just one little formality. I'd like your signature here -- see. And when it's done -- it's done for seven years.  It's our usual form. Of course -- we may be able to take up the question of a renewal in due time. +++$+++ 2000s
That was before I found out what it was. +++$+++ 1990s
Let's go in the other room... +++$+++ 1990s
Telly is at Steven's? +++$+++ 1990s
Yeah ... +++$+++ 1990s
To set yourself a puzzle you won't ever solve. You know how many towns, how many		    * guys called James G? Or John G? Shit, Leonard, I'm a John G. +++$+++ 2000s
No, I'm sorry.  I'm saying I'm sorry. I talk like a jerk sometimes -- +++$+++ 1990s
We're alive. +++$+++ 1990s
... Looks like a convention. +++$+++ 1980s
I'm a hacker! +++$+++ 1990s
Ohhh yes.  No, no.  Just a little, you know...We're fine. +++$+++ 2000s
Right here, Mrs. Kane. +++$+++ 1940s
That's Kim...and this one's Thelma and that's Mrs. Willewska and this is daddy and that's Batman and over there is Robin. +++$+++ 1970s
Stop it, Dil -- +++$+++ 1990s
You've earned it -- the horse ranch on the Toulomoe -- the girl in the spotted gingham. +++$+++ 1940s
Chinese food? +++$+++ 1980s
You haven't finished your beer. +++$+++ 1950s
Ask if he can check how many sick days I've taken since I've worked here? +++$+++ 2000s
Me? +++$+++ 1930s
Honey, he is Mr. Right. +++$+++ 1990s
Uh, well, you just said you were going downtown. +++$+++ 1970s
My signal's fading. +++$+++ 1970s
We'll die if we stay here! +++$+++ 1990s
...And for our Supreme Commander over here and our Commander-in-Chief in Washington. +++$+++ 1970s
No. +++$+++ 1990s
Know what?  Know what, goddammit! +++$+++ 1990s
Yeah. I mean a little, you know. +++$+++ 1980s
Watch? You mean just watch me? Doing it alone? +++$+++ 1970s
No wonder your uncle's so weird... +++$+++ 2000s
What, again? +++$+++ 1930s
So are you.  I mean you're a neat guy. We better get back. +++$+++ 1990s
I think you should ask Mr. Rand that. +++$+++ 1970s
Now look, darlin', this is no time to go off into the fourth dimension. +++$+++ 1990s
It's okay. +++$+++ 2000s
I thought only hookers drank those things. +++$+++ 1990s
How the hell would I know? I wasn't a philosophy major. +++$+++ 1990s
Mike's out -- I think he went to Silver Meadow to see if you were hanging around there. +++$+++ 1990s
Oh. Have a good day at school. +++$+++ 1990s
I was informed just as Laszlo was about to leave the hotel, so I knew I'd be on time. +++$+++ 1940s
You see? We can't have anything to do with John.  You and me will go down to the parlor. +++$+++ 1950s
If you put her on the shit list because of her reaction here tonight I'll go to Dickerson. +++$+++ 1980s
Where's you get the alloy for the throttle itself? +++$+++ 1990s
I'm sorry, I should have been watching where I... +++$+++ 2000s
Lay on, MacDuff. +++$+++ 1960s
Unfortunately no, these Americans are smart, they pay me only half now, half when I get them back to Cairo, so I must go all the way. +++$+++ 1990s
No, c'mon, stop playin'. The girl that you kissed when we got there. Where s he live at? +++$+++ 2000s
Evan wake up, oh please wake up! +++$+++ 2000s
How many you got in there? +++$+++ 1970s
Uh-huh. +++$+++ 1940s
What happened? +++$+++ 1980s
I don't know what you're talking about. +++$+++ 2000s
No it's not. Do you know how you did it Will? +++$+++ 1980s
It's all right. I'm not hurt. +++$+++ 1940s
GUARD!!! +++$+++ 2000s
You left out condescending. +++$+++ 1990s
What unit were you with ? +++$+++ 1970s
No. +++$+++ 1990s
Murder. +++$+++ 2000s
You're a good man. Jimmy the Finn. +++$+++ 2000s
Bastard. +++$+++ 1980s
Point is, listen to them.  They've lost faith in old symbols. They're ready to bond with you, the icon of the future.  If it works, don't fix it... +++$+++ 1990s
Come on, I'll show you around. +++$+++ 1980s
... How did you get into marine salvage? +++$+++ 1990s
No, this is just the second unit. We'll do the main footage later. +++$+++ 1990s
Do we have to? +++$+++ 1950s
I have need of friends. +++$+++ 1980s
What guns? +++$+++ 1970s
Let's just say the Force is something a Jedi Warrior deals with.  It is an energy field in oneself, a power that controls ones acts, yet obeys ones commands.  It is nothing, yet it makes marvels appear before your very eyes. All living things generate this Force field, even you. +++$+++ 1970s
Come on Dorothy. +++$+++ 1980s
How's it going? +++$+++ 1990s
Yes! +++$+++ 1930s
She was beaten, and bloodied, and it was going to go on, uni... +++$+++ 1990s
Always thought "can't" wasn't in a man's vocabulary. +++$+++ 2000s
Don't you? +++$+++ 1990s
We got married at the City Hall and I think it gave bad luck the whole marriage. +++$+++ 1980s
Yes. +++$+++ 1990s
Me. I can only take it up to fifteen minutes. Cause I get bored. +++$+++ 1990s
What are you going to do? +++$+++ 2000s
Will I believe you when you tell me something? +++$+++ 2000s
There's my dad with Joanie. +++$+++ 2000s
I thought I'd invest in a film. I want to sort of become involved in the process of making a film, meet the people who make films, learn how it's done... +++$+++ 1970s
No, no... But Mark -- a jealous boyfriend gone mad. Maybe he kills men you date. +++$+++ 1980s
There's nothing more to talk about. +++$+++ 2000s
By the way, we gotta go see Ma tomorrow. +++$+++ 1980s
No -- in my room. +++$+++ 1960s
What kind of animal? +++$+++ 1980s
Unscheduled surgery.  He'll be waltzing along momentarily.  What're you doing tonight? +++$+++ 1980s
You told him I was here and he wanted to know if I was beating you up. +++$+++ 1970s
You killed Santa Claus? +++$+++ 2000s
Her doctors murdered her. They gave her the wrong anesthetic and they put her in the hospital for life.  Her doctors murdered her. +++$+++ 1980s
Did you meet Captain Kirk? +++$+++ 1990s
Apropos of nothing... so. So so so so -- +++$+++ 2000s
Today is March second, 2063. The time in Montana is oh-eight-forty- five. +++$+++ 1990s
One shot -- for emergencies. +++$+++ 1990s
It means...I'm a paranoid nitwit who's never let his baby girl out of his sight for the simple reason he's a paranoid nitwit. So why don't you just say &quot;Oh Dad&quot; and get on the damn plane already? +++$+++ 1990s
And I won't never tell about the money. +++$+++ 1950s
Lynn. +++$+++ 1990s
Not according to the men in blue. +++$+++ 1990s
Don't thank us too fast, Viktor. You know what we have to do? +++$+++ 2010s
Yeah. +++$+++ 2000s
Diz--get what he says to the people back in that State. It's up to you and the boys. Keep those wires hot. Fire away, pal! +++$+++ 1930s
What for?  We've got a job to finish ...Why are you making the monitor? +++$+++ 1980s
Cute young thing, too. +++$+++ 1980s
You did. +++$+++ 2000s
You, too, Roy. +++$+++ 1990s
Just be cool. +++$+++ 1990s
Did Sam call to tell you he wouldn't be over this weekend? +++$+++ 2000s
That's for me to know and for you to find out. I'll see you. I mean call you. okay? +++$+++ 1990s
Why? +++$+++ 1990s
Well I think they come from... angel lights on their mothers chest and whispers into her ear. That makes good babies start to grow. And bad babies come from when a fallen angel squeezes in down there, and they start to grow, grow, till they come out down there. I don't know where good babies come out. And you can't tell the difference... except bad babies cry a lot... and they make their fathers go away... and their mothers get very ill... die sometimes. +++$+++ 1980s
Jesus... +++$+++ 1990s
Yeah -- ? +++$+++ 2000s
Exactly. And then -- maybe -- not right away -- There's a room right off the bedroom -- It would be perfect for a nursery.  It's a walk in humidor right now -- but if I took out the refrigeration unit -- +++$+++ 2000s
Not one word.  That's an order. +++$+++ 1990s
What happened to title dictates behavior? +++$+++ 1990s
Never better. +++$+++ 1990s
Took a pig-slicker to the heart. +++$+++ 2000s
O.K. +++$+++ 1980s
Please!... Trust me this much...  I'll be back. Look, there is something I should tell you. The fishing club that old lady mentioned, the pieces off the flag. +++$+++ 1970s
I was in love once, Willow.  She had a hold on my heart.  I could barely function.  I *was* a great swordsman!  I was knighted!  I could have been king! +++$+++ 1980s
Not every day? +++$+++ 1990s
-- dating the crash at least that old. +++$+++ 1990s
I don't know. He was right behind us. Wait here. I'll be right back. +++$+++ 2000s
Johnny, you're a real jerk-off. +++$+++ 1980s
I should go. I should leave today. +++$+++ 1930s
Will you shut up! +++$+++ 1990s
How are you, Nick? +++$+++ 1990s
Thank you.  But who sits there? +++$+++ 1940s
That's good. It's not better. Where? +++$+++ 1980s
Oh, I understand, all right. I've been understanding since I was seventeen. And the next step is, as long as you're going to see me tomorrow, why don't you stay the night. +++$+++ 1950s
A month. +++$+++ 1990s
We ran a search on relatives. He has a cousin in town -- Clarence Teal. Smalltime thief. Last known address was on Pine Street. He moved out a month ago. We've got a couple leads on him to check out. +++$+++ 1990s
Nothing is going on with us, is it? +++$+++ 2000s
I think he's got a terrific personality. +++$+++ 1970s
I have coffee in the thermos. +++$+++ 1980s
Jake, this is your father's bedroom. +++$+++ 1980s
Nonsense. A man is always ready for marriage -- with the right girl. And Lisa Fremont is the right girl for any man with half a brain, who can get one eye open. +++$+++ 1950s
Mostly. Sometimes they do things. +++$+++ 1980s
I'll offer you more than it's worth. And you know you won't have to move. Nothing will change except the name on the deed, you have my word. +++$+++ 2000s
Years ago. And it was Zaltar who stole it. +++$+++ 1980s
No problem. +++$+++ 1990s
Dad--? +++$+++ 1990s
HARRY, this is my fantasy! I suggest you leave - before I imagine something horrible. +++$+++ 2000s
Ed, I am so very disappointed in you. +++$+++ 1980s
But the time is now. Soon others will come. +++$+++ 1990s
Kept calling it "murder" when I did it. +++$+++ 2000s
This is Claudia, Anna's friend...  You've never met my husband, have you? +++$+++ 1960s
I know. I know. Help me, here. Look around. +++$+++ 1990s
Your Majesty! +++$+++ 1990s
She's entering deep sleep now. Heart rate's a little high due to anxiety, but otherwise she's nicely relaxed. All normal. She could dream at any time now.  Right now she's like a diver on the bottom of an ocean no one's mapped yet. Waiting to see what shows up. +++$+++ 1980s
He'll be here.  Look, take this for now. +++$+++ 1980s
They only kill them when they love them? +++$+++ 2000s
Listen to me I -- +++$+++ 2000s
Remember my friend we saw on t.v.? +++$+++ 1990s
What? +++$+++ 1980s
Get rid of them. +++$+++ 2000s
It's me or Wallace, Jack.  Wallace's third party is only going to help McGovern.  I need your support. +++$+++ 1990s
You mean with the flowers...? +++$+++ 2000s
This is terrible.  Either there's a monster in my kitchen or I'm completely crazy. +++$+++ 1980s
She's not here. +++$+++ 1990s
Get up. +++$+++ 1990s
Mr. Swayzak! How ya doin'? +++$+++ 1990s
How did you find me? +++$+++ 1990s
Do you ever regret things you've done? +++$+++ 1990s
Don't tell me you aren't ashamed of that because I know. +++$+++ 2000s
Go tuck yourself, Bill. +++$+++ 1990s
Or you can quit. +++$+++ 1980s
Dr. Bright, I don't have to do anything. +++$+++ 1990s
Martin, I'm not connected to those people anymore. Not since I walked out of a loanshark Operation in Miami. +++$+++ 1990s
In ages, I know, me neither. +++$+++ 1990s
I can't help how I think. You're trained a certain way when you're a kid and you can't change. +++$+++ 1940s
No, I'm not. +++$+++ 1990s
Did -- did you -- +++$+++ 2000s
I only have something like sixteen weeks. +++$+++ 1980s
No. +++$+++ 1990s
Well, a rough estimate... I'd say fifteen. +++$+++ 1970s
Yes. +++$+++ 1990s
Oh, it's nothing... I better go, I'll talk to you later. +++$+++ 2000s
Yeah.  Go on, beat it. +++$+++ 1970s
It's always the women that start the trouble. +++$+++ 1980s
I'm fine. +++$+++ 1990s
She's a Commie pig. We're going to nail every last one... +++$+++ 1970s
You know, this future shit sucks. I'll fucking do it. +++$+++ 2000s
Okay. +++$+++ 2000s
No it doesn't. I see right through you. +++$+++ 1990s
But I'm afraid of water, so that's been holding my career back a little bit. +++$+++ 2000s
If there's a funnier man in the world than Herbie Temple at the Palace...uh...pardon us for not catching the name, we were too busy laughing.  No, make that 'screaming'.  It's sweet of you, J.J., thanks. Probably see you at Twenty One tonight.  No, for supper, late. Right. 'Bye... +++$+++ 1950s
-- And the cooling unit on the other. +++$+++ 1970s
What happened? +++$+++ 1990s
What's tira misu? +++$+++ 1990s
Who wrote it? +++$+++ 1990s
Game, set and match, Steven. You've outdone yourself. And I know it's not good manners to ask the magician how he did it, but inquiring minds are desperate to know: just what did really happen to Ms. Marr? +++$+++ 1990s
Out of the question. +++$+++ 1990s
No.  But he has no love for the Empire, that much I know ... +++$+++ 1980s
What are you going to do with my day tomorrow, M'sieu Laval? +++$+++ 1930s
But facts! They have to be verified. Anything from their past, their present, business, personal -- arrests, affairs ... And whoever comes up with the sleaziest, most degrading material -- I'11 give you ten thousand dollars. And you get to be on Ed TV.  Hah? +++$+++ 1990s
Mais non, c'est pour toi. +++$+++ 1970s
Yeah.  But that's what I wanted to talk to you about. +++$+++ 1980s
Yes. +++$+++ 2000s
Get him out of here! +++$+++ 1970s
Going somewhere? +++$+++ 1990s
Who? +++$+++ 2000s
WHAT did you say? +++$+++ 1980s
Come, everyone, let us repair to the main chamber. Project Vulcan is about to begin. Scott, are you coming? +++$+++ 1990s
I didn't used to be afraid of it. +++$+++ 1940s
I killed Bob Ray Lemon, didn't I? +++$+++ 1990s
You're welcome. It's a lot more interesting than just flinging off your clothes and boning away on the neighbor's swing set. +++$+++ 1980s
I stood alone on the green, searching for something, and I started to walk to the church. But then the darkness closed in, I was alone in the dark, being pulled into darkness, and I fought to wake up... +++$+++ 1950s
What trail are you trying to throw me off now? +++$+++ 1990s
Is your confidence in me fully restored? +++$+++ 1960s
And there will come <u>another</u> moment. When the stakes are <u>really</u> there. And she will look back on this.  And remember how good it felt.  How easy it was. +++$+++ 1990s
I've come, I'm here, I'm staying. Unless there are ticks. +++$+++ 1990s
Until he's done. +++$+++ 1990s
Being rich is <u>not a trap</u>. That is a dirty lie perpetuated by rich people to keep the failures from killing them. +++$+++ 2000s
So cool. +++$+++ 1990s
To get on the board.  Yeah.  How you goan'a get on the board sell'n a Polack?  And I'll tell you, I'll tell you what else.  You listening? I'll tell you what else: don't ever try to sell an Indian. +++$+++ 1990s
I've never heard of her. Maybe something else was on his mind. +++$+++ 2000s
Attack? Who -- or should I say what from? +++$+++ 1960s
Yes, I agree, I think so too. +++$+++ 1970s
No. You don't. +++$+++ 2000s
He may be a kook but he's also been all over the world with them.  He even swam in the Grimetti with killer Niles all around him, he never got nipped. +++$+++ 1990s
Is it fair to say that you do not know for <u>certain</u> which it was. +++$+++ 1990s
Good. +++$+++ 2000s
He was I.A.  He probably asked her about it. +++$+++ 1990s
I am. +++$+++ 1990s
Yeah.  You don't wanna know the details. +++$+++ 1990s
Good idea.  Flying over mountains can give you some nasty surprises.  Go too low, one of the clouds might have a big rock inside it. +++$+++ 1990s
Wa-shee is like... a dumpling. Like tallow we put in stew. I think he was calling you chubby boy. +++$+++ 1990s
Must be exciting, Beautiful place, beautiful people. +++$+++ 2000s
I don't believe it. He looks so...normal. He seems so... out of it. So...undangerous. +++$+++ 2000s
How does it feel to get that much money just for being you? +++$+++ 2000s
Segretti criss-crossed the country over ten times in six months--and never stayed anyplace over a night or two.  Switch to another station, huh? You're driving me crazy with that. +++$+++ 1970s
Well, seems like Zanuck's got himself a baseball picture. +++$+++ 1950s
I'm getting married. +++$+++ 1980s
I do. +++$+++ 1990s
No, you idiot. I said "Is it a receptacle tip?" Not, is Luis a despicable twit. Is it a receptacle tip? Get off me. +++$+++ 2000s
Ever see NATURAL BORN KILLERS? Well, Derek and I have this whole Mickey/Mallory-Woody Harrelson/Juliette Lewis thing going on. +++$+++ 1990s
Who to? +++$+++ 1930s
Today ain't my day. +++$+++ 2000s
And if the truth is so horrible that it will haunt your dreams for all time? +++$+++ 2000s
This was World War I? +++$+++ 1990s
Fuck you. +++$+++ 1990s
"Los Angeles, UPI: Elijah Muhammad, 67-year-old leader of the Black Muslim Movement, today faced paternity suits from two former secretaries who charged he fathered their four children..." +++$+++ 1990s
I don't care about the intention. I just know your Cross Action is a plus on our side. I've seen it come through four times. +++$+++ 1970s
Think again! +++$+++ 1940s
So now I got all those coffins on my hands - and I hate to see them go to waste. +++$+++ 1950s
It just is. +++$+++ 1970s
End a April. +++$+++ 1990s
And thank you as well for that conversational hiatus; I generally refrain from speech while engaged in gustation. There are those who attempt both at the same time but I find it course and vulgar. Now where were we? +++$+++ 2000s
Is he....? +++$+++ 1980s
Spare me. +++$+++ 2000s
Joe could help him. If we can get in touch with Joe, Joe could get him to a doctor, Joe could get a doctor to come and see him. +++$+++ 1990s
A lot of 'em choose both. There's not like a borderline between the good people and the bad people--you're not either on one side or the other-- +++$+++ 1990s
Martini! +++$+++ 1970s
Lord Walton assures me this guy's one of the very top scholars in the English art world.  Has a couple of doctorates no less. +++$+++ 1990s
What is wrong with you? +++$+++ 1990s
Then, that being so, why is today special?  Why have you come back to see me?  Is it that new file they gave you? +++$+++ 2000s
I've always wanted to learn something like that. +++$+++ 1990s
I'm not in the mood right now, Ray. +++$+++ 2000s
Why? +++$+++ 1990s
Ah, so that's it.  To you I'm just a girl. +++$+++ 2000s
That's worth fifteen grand to ya? +++$+++ 1970s
You're ready, don't worry. +++$+++ 1990s
Don't you miss it? +++$+++ 2000s
Really? +++$+++ 1930s
No. +++$+++ 2000s
The first reports came in at about ten. +++$+++ 1990s
A man has my family.  Gold watch here. Dark tan. +++$+++ 2000s
-- Kobo... I know.  He killed two of my partners.  One in New York, one at the printing plant. +++$+++ 1980s
'Mr Rothstein' is good enough. +++$+++ 1990s
Yes, Reverend? +++$+++ 1970s
Cut that shit out.  Maybe before, but not now. I want to help you. I'm on your side. +++$+++ 1980s
No problem, sir! +++$+++ 1990s
I snuck back to my car, trying to convince myself it never happened.  And when I woke up in the hospital...somehow it hadn't.  Until now. +++$+++ 2000s
He wants to know who brought in the chalice. +++$+++ 1990s
I didn't ask you all that, Sweet Pea. I asked if you loved her. +++$+++ 1980s
Or rather, do you think you're being exploited or are you yourself exploiting the white image of the black artist from the ghetto? +++$+++ 1990s
No she's not. +++$+++ 1990s
Don't we already have someone to do that for us? +++$+++ 1990s
That'll bring me down, too. Eventually.  You gotta know that. +++$+++ 1990s
Well you'll always be Sadie to me. +++$+++ 1990s
Neither do I, sir.  C:  And this is the worst one, we find Ryan and he's wounded.  Not only does he not carry my gear, we have to carry his gear. And him. +++$+++ 1990s
Yeah, right, vision is highly over- rated. +++$+++ 1990s
We're not cops.  We're from Massachusettes.  I mean, does he look like a cop? +++$+++ 2000s
Yes. She bought my sister's business. +++$+++ 1940s
You'll visit again? +++$+++ 1980s
Bullshit! Your uncle told you! +++$+++ 1990s
If you don't mind my asking... Who's close to you? +++$+++ 1980s
Midshipman, you're a tiger. +++$+++ 1980s
Who? +++$+++ 1990s
I don’t care who you are.  It’s Christmas and like I told you the building is closed. +++$+++ 2000s
Why, you... you little bastard! +++$+++ 1980s
He was, like, a total babe +++$+++ 1990s
Lugosi's washed-up.  What else you got? +++$+++ 1990s
No, Rose, he'll help you. +++$+++ 1990s
Any untoward "revelation" regarding, uh... +++$+++ 1990s
French fries. I like to eat them pretty good. +++$+++ 1990s
Handymen, Earl.  We're handymen. +++$+++ 1990s
I ruined your wedding night. +++$+++ 2000s
...That's fine. +++$+++ 1990s
You want to give me an AIDS <u>test</u>?! +++$+++ 1990s
...to be off the island tonight. +++$+++ 1990s
There's always an excuse, isn't there? +++$+++ 1980s
Hey, you know, what can I say, I dig those cute little sweaters she wears. +++$+++ 1990s
Neil, you're not gonna... +++$+++ 1980s
Dr. Milo, please don't call my wife mad. +++$+++ 1970s
No. Keep rubbing. +++$+++ 2000s
If I smell one drop of Scotch on your breath, my friend -- +++$+++ 1980s
You get off on abuse or something? +++$+++ 2000s
Uum... around ten? +++$+++ 1990s
Taylor -- just keep quiet and we may get away with this. Remember that men all look alike to most apes. +++$+++ 2000s
Oh, yeah. +++$+++ 2000s
Mulder. Move away from the door. We're coming through it. +++$+++ 1990s
Right there. +++$+++ 1990s
He couldn't have. +++$+++ 1990s
I have to. It was Irving August -- everything Mrs. Redi said -— it fits in with what I saw -— she even knew I'd seen his body on the subway. +++$+++ 1940s
What'd he get? +++$+++ 1990s
So. Is it different to how you imagined it? +++$+++ 2000s
Well... that's wonderful -- I'll stop by there for a drink. +++$+++ 1970s
Twenty-eight years, Frank. +++$+++ 1980s
It'll be fine, yeah. +++$+++ 2000s
Stay late at your work tomorrow night and I'll bring you the gear. +++$+++ 1990s
Great.  Really. +++$+++ 2000s
You figured what? +++$+++ 1990s
He didn't <u>give</u> me-- +++$+++ 1990s
Do you have any luggage, Mister --  Gladstone? +++$+++ 1960s
I don't gamble, Mr Reynolds. +++$+++ 1990s
I'd like a word with you, Jack. +++$+++ 2000s
Guys, he's right behind us! +++$+++ 2000s
Yeah, but how are you supposed to make the first move? +++$+++ 1990s
Oh, yes!  we'll keep him in here, obviously.  But if he had to leave and we were with him. +++$+++ 1970s
Dylan.  And...  Chase.  My God, Wes, did you know? +++$+++ 1990s
Can you see a body? +++$+++ 1990s
Arnie, help me.  Doesn't anyone owe us money? +++$+++ 2000s
'Tis but a scratch. +++$+++ 1970s
How could I?  I will do my best. After all, you see, I am financially interested. +++$+++ 1940s
...I just don't know what... to do– +++$+++ 1990s
Hey, you could call me "Bernie," forget the "Mister LaPlante" stuff.  You are naive. +++$+++ 1990s
We'll have to make them come to us, won't we? And since there are two of them, we're going to set two plans in motion.  First: we must move the entire hospital by tomorrow night. +++$+++ 1990s
Do you love Drew? +++$+++ 1990s
What? +++$+++ 1980s
Your insight is enlightening. +++$+++ 2000s
I wish I knew. +++$+++ 1940s
Well, suppose she got a little further north than she should have.  Got stuck in the ice. The passengers and crew evacuated. She froze into the ice pack, which moved further north, where it froze in solid. They write it off. Fifty years later, the whole global warming thing happens. The ice melts, she gets loose and floats around til somebody runs into her. +++$+++ 2000s
Good. +++$+++ 1980s
Why, I think it's very sweet of the children-- +++$+++ 1930s
Tough...  ...I get off duty at five-thirty.  How long you been divorced? +++$+++ 1970s
You know, I've been going over our financial condition - if you'll pardon the expression... +++$+++ 1950s
I don't know. +++$+++ 1990s
Well, pull in your reel, Mr. Fielding. You're barking up the wrong fish. +++$+++ 1950s
What's this? +++$+++ 2000s
Each circumstance requires a different tactic. +++$+++ 1990s
I dunno.  Marry the first whore who's nice to me, I guess.  Get a job in a motorcycle shop.  So long, you guys. +++$+++ 1970s
I dined at the prison. +++$+++ 1980s
Look, look, look. You gotta go now, okay? The customers complain. +++$+++ 1990s
Okay how many fingers am I holding up? +++$+++ 2000s
Great! I'II build a house-- right over there, with a veranda looking out to sea. And I'll plant a garden! Papayas, pineapples, bananas, mangoes--- anything'll grow here. And I'II fish in the lagoon, and we can go sailing in a dugout canoe, and--- +++$+++ 1980s
What? +++$+++ 1940s
Yes. I have never known birds of different species to flock together. The very concept is unimaginable.  Why if that happened, we wouldn't have a chance. How could we possible hope to fight them? +++$+++ 1960s
And then Sam, you and I clean up whatever's left to be cleaned. +++$+++ 1990s
That's it then. That's it. I've always been alone. That's why I'm a good driver. I can handle it. See, I can think on my feet. I survive, I'm a thinker. And I can sit there in front of your house for two hours and it don't bother me. Some people can't do it! Some people are ranting and raving, "Tell them fuckin' people to get out here and get in this car, I can't-- I want a go!" Where you gonna go? You're gonna wind up back in your garage at seven o'clock at night. You ain't going nowhere. You leave your house in the morning you get back to your house in the evening. What's the big deal, right? +++$+++ 1990s
Oh. And, Harry, he's the one who likes magic? +++$+++ 2000s
I've got a lot of respect for you too.  For the way you feel about your family. +++$+++ 2000s
Dissent? +++$+++ 2000s
Just before she died she came to-- +++$+++ 1980s
He's dead. +++$+++ 2000s
You need a bass and a sax, don't you? +++$+++ 1950s
I was at Beadles. +++$+++ 1990s
Very impressive. +++$+++ 1970s
Man, you play like a kokonut. You got to call him at least. +++$+++ 1960s
Thank you, Peter.  Thank you so much. +++$+++ 1990s
Yeah I'm goin' to bring you somethin' all right. I've decided to make you a special project of mine. You ain't goin' to have to look for me at all. +++$+++ 2000s
It's certainly the best chance they've had to kill you. +++$+++ 1990s
Sure you do. This ward is air tight, I have a little extra oxygen pumped in, keeps my spirits up. +++$+++ 1970s
Aha! -- The Baron. What do you want here? +++$+++ 1930s
... And the children thought I should take a trip. +++$+++ 1990s
I know the secret.  The worm is the spice... the spice is the worm. +++$+++ 1980s
It's dangerous.  It's dangerous, to me, personally. +++$+++ 1990s
So your husband said he's think it over.  Encouraged Mr. Miyamoto to believe he might sell to h... +++$+++ 1990s
Oh, don't do this! +++$+++ 1980s
Walter, I'm sure there's a reason you brought your dirty undies-- +++$+++ 1990s
Beth? +++$+++ 1990s
Right -- want another one? +++$+++ 1990s
You missed my point; you are no longer an owner. +++$+++ 1970s
A machine.  But a machine that does what? +++$+++ 1990s
Dude, we don't have watches. +++$+++ 1990s
Well, I'll tell you why I ask. You see, I've got a girl who works in the Auditing Department of the Territorial Administrator and I haven't been able to get her on the phone for the past week or so, and with all these stories one hears, I'm a little concerned about her. +++$+++ 1960s
I love to swim, and I don't mind the cold at all. It's invigorating. +++$+++ 1970s
There seem to be lots of reasons why I shouldn't. +++$+++ 1990s
Why are you talking like that? +++$+++ 2000s
I want amphetamines. +++$+++ 2000s
Yeah. +++$+++ 1980s
Yeah, non-believer?  Here's yours...  "Scorpio, October 24 to November 22: Jupiter is in conflict with Saturn, so proceed with caution..." +++$+++ 2000s
That's okay, I assure you. It's just that I was trying to work – +++$+++ 1990s
What are you talking about? +++$+++ 1980s
Karma...  You know, if you do something bad to somebody fate will pay you back by something bad happening to you. +++$+++ 1990s
A bank? +++$+++ 2000s
Ninety degrees to the left, I hope. How does she feel about you? +++$+++ 1990s
That's it. +++$+++ 2000s
I call. What you got? +++$+++ 1940s
We should be so lucky. +++$+++ 2000s
Okay, Kent, call your people and tell them the Prodigal Son is coming home. FAVORING CLARK -- Happy now, he turns to leave the office. SHOT LOSES PERRY but we continue to hear his voice, o.s. +++$+++ 1980s
Dad! +++$+++ 1980s
Thank you; but it's missing something. +++$+++ 1960s
Do they have cable? +++$+++ 1990s
I had one, but it was taken at the battle of Condawn... +++$+++ 1970s
...wanna savor this. +++$+++ 2000s
Yes please! +++$+++ 1990s
I can't go nowhere. +++$+++ 1990s
I'm coming home right now, Ma. I'll be home in about two minutes. Tell Thomas stick around, I wanna see him about something. +++$+++ 1950s
...the Michelin commercial... +++$+++ 1990s
The G-man? +++$+++ 2000s
Yes. +++$+++ 1990s
That was unbelievable what you did to Lucas. The guy's an animal. +++$+++ 2000s
Pinkerton. It's been eight months. I see robberies. I see hold ups. But I do not see men on the end of nooses. +++$+++ 2000s
You weren't straight with us, Frankie, what else could we do? +++$+++ 1970s
Well, Stew, that's all thrashed out. By golly, I'm surely glad to see that you're not really sore. You know our racket - after all, news is news. +++$+++ 1930s
Okay. +++$+++ 1960s
Like a tea ceremony? +++$+++ 1970s
My name's Sophia. +++$+++ 2000s
Absolutely. +++$+++ 2000s
Don't be so amazed. It's a very ordinary matter. I'm Jacqueline's physician... Mr. Ward told me you were in town and Jacqueline has sent me to bring you to her. +++$+++ 1940s
My dear Talleyrand, none of the Kings of Europe bear any friendship for France.  It is easy for you to talk of reliable treaties.  The only treaties you have been able to negotiate are the ones I have won on the battlefield. +++$+++ 1990s
Town Police. +++$+++ 1970s
I've got to talk to you... +++$+++ 1990s
No, the children sleep with me. +++$+++ 1960s
Abby-- +++$+++ 1980s
Why did he ask if it was frozen? +++$+++ 1990s
Well,... I'm a singer by trade... Summer stock...nightclub revues... that kind of thing...It used to be what I absolutely lived for...God...I can do GYPSY backwards - every part- but, one night...in the middle of singing "Funny..... - it suddenly hit me... ...what does all of this really mean?  That, and the fact that all my friends are dead...God, I sound like a veteran. Dad would be so proud. +++$+++ 1990s
Do you still want me to stay? +++$+++ 2000s
She was torn apart! She died of a broken heart. +++$+++ 1990s
Yeah... I'll write a song.  Ha, ha. I don't know.  Life is funny! +++$+++ 1970s
Sit tight, Diz. The show commences in just a minute. +++$+++ 1930s
Which is? +++$+++ 1990s
I'm glad you feel that way, because I feel that way, too. +++$+++ 1980s
History's proven that where there's a nitrogenizer, there's a 12-legged signazoid.  They use it to make our food digestible for their systems. +++$+++ 1990s
"InGen."  What's InGen? +++$+++ 1990s
Ready? +++$+++ 1990s
Okay.  Yeah.  We know +++$+++ 1990s
Miss Ratched, would you please save a space for my aunt? She's comin' down from Portland. +++$+++ 1970s
Yeah, I can fix it. +++$+++ 1990s
People seem to like my cat. +++$+++ 1950s
Yeah. +++$+++ 1990s
It's Maria Portos. What should we do? +++$+++ 1990s
Then you meet someone special and all you want to do is toss them the key, say open up, step inside, but you can't because it's dark and there are demons and if anybody saw how ugly it was... +++$+++ 1990s
Be my friend. +++$+++ 1970s
I don't know...  What about the other women? +++$+++ 2000s
I... do you want me to leave? +++$+++ 1980s
"... encased in the armor of a demigod, Narcissus The Good continues his impossible climb in the arena where he was unjustly cast..." +++$+++ 2000s
no, no, no.  Certainly not.  I wasn't officialy enrolled, that's right. Was that unclear? +++$+++ 1990s
I do as I please. +++$+++ 2000s
My Jewish friend's grandmother did. +++$+++ 1990s
So how did you get off that island, anyway? +++$+++ 2000s
Here. Eat your head off. +++$+++ 1930s
Island.  Far. +++$+++ 1990s
There was some sophistos from the TV studios around the corner, laughing an govoreeting. The Devotchka was smecking away, and not caring about the wicked world one bit. Then the disc on the stereo twanged off and out, and in the short silence before the next one came on, she suddenly came with a burst of singing, and it was like for a moment, O my brothers, some great bird had flown into the milkbar and I felt all the malenky little hairs on my plott standing endwise, athe shivers crawling up like slow malenky lizards and then down again. Because I knew what she sang. It was a bit from the glorious 9th, by Ludwig van. Dim makes a lip-trump followed by a dog howl, followed by two fingers pronging twice in the air, followed by a clowny guffaw. Alex brings his stick down smartly on Dim's legs. +++$+++ 1970s
Do you want me to come up and tuck you in? +++$+++ 1980s
What do we do if there isn't? +++$+++ 1980s
What did he look like? +++$+++ 1970s
Mr. Bartholomew -- if you're trying to frighten me you're doing a really first-rate job! +++$+++ 1960s
She's pretty special. +++$+++ 2000s
I'm sorry to say that our time is running short, but before we close, I'd like to ask one final question. What sort of gardener, sir, would you be? +++$+++ 1970s
I'll cancel every meeting right now. I'll give you a job myself. I just wanted you to see what was out there. +++$+++ 1990s
...well, it suits you... +++$+++ 1990s
Are you breaking the contract? +++$+++ 1950s
I don't thinks you'd want me tripping all over you in front of everybody. +++$+++ 1990s
Y'want to gimme Brigham's pistol? +++$+++ 2000s
Is that just beer? +++$+++ 2000s
... That's funny... I had this job with Enzo... we got fired too. +++$+++ 1980s
Why? +++$+++ 1990s
It's not really anyone per se, it's more of separate groupings. +++$+++ 1990s
Well, oh... +++$+++ 1990s
George is great but I know what you mean. +++$+++ 1970s
The Board of Parrish Communications - is hereby called to order.  Our sole order of business is an acceptance of John Bontecou's generous offer and -- +++$+++ 1990s
Old tricks are the best tricks eh? +++$+++ 1990s
Say Matt, you haven't done anything about what you saw today, have you? +++$+++ 1930s
Yah, but that TruCoat - +++$+++ 1990s
One-two-three, one-two-three, twirl- two-three... +++$+++ 1930s
Dumb riddles, Merlin. I am your King. +++$+++ 1980s
But </u>alive</u>! +++$+++ 1990s
That's what I want to talk to you about? +++$+++ 1990s
Shit... I thought they was gonna get us. I was even... scared a little... just for a minute.  Was you ever scared in them days? +++$+++ 1990s
Damn... damn... damn... +++$+++ 1990s
But it is a part of our lives too --a part of our past, It's a Goya reproduction. Those three cats --  are supposed to be the most beautifully drawn cats in Western art. +++$+++ 1940s
You got to sit on Eldridge... +++$+++ 1990s
How do you know? +++$+++ 1990s
I'm looking at you, and the whole time I can't help thinking you had your willie inside her hootchie-kooch. +++$+++ 1990s
Well I'm certain Doctor Spangler will want to talk with you; excuse me. +++$+++ 1970s
Good-bye.  Well, your luck is holding. They sublet your place. You're homeless. Frank's got a line on another place you can use for now. +++$+++ 1990s
You want me to fuck you? Is that it? Okay, come here. Take your clothes off. Get into bed. +++$+++ 1980s
Like do anything, you know. +++$+++ 1970s
Oh, Mr. Dickson - they're going to arrest Matt. They think he did it! +++$+++ 1930s
He filmed his victims. +++$+++ 1990s
So? How was school today? +++$+++ 2000s
Yeah. Well -- that's the way it crumbles, cookie-wise. Go to sleep. +++$+++ 1960s
I don't have a week.  This case never should have come to trial. You know better.  You're Mr. Independent.  You want to be independent?  Be independent now. I've got no sympathy for you. +++$+++ 1970s
Isn't "bait" the word you used? +++$+++ 1970s
Oh come on!  Even you can see its value. +++$+++ 1950s
No. +++$+++ 1970s
Everyone out of the rigging NOW! +++$+++ 1990s
Nah, let's just take a look-see. +++$+++ 2000s
A .38. +++$+++ 1990s
...Mrs. Calvert? +++$+++ 1990s
Ti amo. +++$+++ 1980s
Wait. You hungry?  You gotta be hungry, you just flew in from China. And what'd they feed you, Chinese food, right?  Then you gotta be hungry.  Hell, it doesn't matter, I'm hungry.  We'll get some food on the way to the Consulate. +++$+++ 1990s
Good. +++$+++ 1940s

And Skynet fights back. +++$+++ 1990s
I know you wouldn't need Leon if Heidi was treating you right.  The thing I don't understand is why you come out and sleep with Heidi anyway?  You got two kids on welfare now.  What're you goin' to bed with her, you don't have enough with one wife and two kids on welfare, you want a wife and three kids on welfare? +++$+++ 1970s
... Manly? +++$+++ 1990s
No thank you. +++$+++ 2000s
-- good afternoon -- +++$+++ 1970s

Let go of me! +++$+++ 1990s

Quiet! +++$+++ 1930s
CRIMINAL +++$+++ 1980s
But you don't like coming here. Be honest, Walter. +++$+++ 2000s
Just some guy. Does it even matter who? I stopped asking myself why a long time ago. No reason, no conspiracy; just bad fucking luck. A couple of junkies, too			 * strung out to realize that your wife didn't live alone. When you killed him,			* I've never seen you so happy - I was convinced you'd remember. But it didn't stick, like nothing ever sticks. Like this won't stick. +++$+++ 2000s
I think they call it a pasture. +++$+++ 1990s
Hey, Nick! God damn!... What've you been doin', I mean... +++$+++ 1970s

Your mother and I do not wish to be disturbed for three full hours. +++$+++ 1970s
Fine. Welcome. Come sit down. +++$+++ 1990s
$10,000! I don't know what to do, Ed. I don't know what I *can* do. Even though I know who the sonofabitch is. +++$+++ 2000s
You're right, madame, it will all be over by Thursday. +++$+++ 1930s
Not a problem unless you're gonna make -- +++$+++ 2000s
Do you mind if I ask you a personal question? +++$+++ 1990s
I've learned so much since then.  And I'll return to finish ... I promise that, master. +++$+++ 1980s
The food doesn't please you? +++$+++ 1990s
They could be as curious about us as we are about them. +++$+++ 1950s
With smoke. +++$+++ 1960s
Eddie, how was I? +++$+++ 1990s
The key to success is using the right tools. +++$+++ 1990s
I know it's over, asshole, I -- +++$+++ 2000s
We need to give you a physical, so we know what got zapped. +++$+++ 1990s
But we need a creative dissent. Our voices are not joined in any harmonious chorus, but the differences are differences of emphasis, not of fundamentals. Now, the new alignment's greatest need is to communicate with all its elements, rather than march along in parallel line that never converge.  Tomorrow as we focus the new movement more clearly, we will gain a new unity. +++$+++ 1970s
I'll pay you another visit, with a share of the profits, once its sold. +++$+++ 2000s
I sure do. +++$+++ 2000s
How many deaths is he responsible for? How many innocent people? You may only get one shot at a man like Renard. Same circumstances, I’d do the same again. +++$+++ 1990s
I never had anything before, Epps.  I never was anybody.  Not the kind of somebody you can be with a pocket full of gold coins.  When I was in high school I used to-- +++$+++ 1990s
Even now. +++$+++ 1990s
It's utterly beautiful.  I wish I could be creative. +++$+++ 1950s
I'm sorry. +++$+++ 1990s
Bullshit! Would it have happened to you? +++$+++ 1990s
Yes. Shall we start on it right now-- or order dinner first? +++$+++ 1930s
Oh fuck that. You don't have to try and impress anyone. You think I give a shit? You think I sweat that skanky whore waitress... +++$+++ 1990s
We still have some extra ones, don't we?  Maybe we can just -- +++$+++ 1990s
Yes! +++$+++ 1980s
They're truck drivers. +++$+++ 2000s
I tried to tell myself it was for the best, that there was a reason behind it. But... Del? +++$+++ 2000s
I do <u>not</u> like you. +++$+++ 1990s
What's the maid's address? +++$+++ 1970s
No. Precisely. We begin by coveting what we see every day. Don't you feel eyes moving over your body, Clarice? I hardly see how you couldn't. And don't your eyes move over the things you want? +++$+++ 1990s
Yet you stood up to be counted with the enemy of everything the Grail stands for -- who gives a damn what you think? +++$+++ 1980s
How ya doin' Miss Evans? +++$+++ 1980s

Bye. +++$+++ 2000s
Well, the Hindus say -- and the beatniks also -- that in the next life some of us will come back as ants. Some will be butterflies. Others will be elephants or creatures of the sea. +++$+++ 1990s
It'll tell you pretty much everything about us... +++$+++ 1980s
...campus security...send someone...check out...place... +++$+++ 1990s
I do not know.  I pray that I shall never have to raise my sword against one that I call friend. +++$+++ 1990s
Yeah but, she reminds me of this chick that I remember from fourth grade... called a... shit, what did we call her?  Oh yeah, Patty Pee-pee Pants... when ever she got called on by Miss Chumski, this chick would piss in her pants and start bawling. +++$+++ 2000s
Mickey Spillane? +++$+++ 1990s
It was full of this awful pink ooze. +++$+++ 1980s
Well.  You're sorry and I'm sorry. +++$+++ 2000s
What's your fucking point? +++$+++ 1990s
Well... what the fuck, man? +++$+++ 1970s
Annabelle, daddy and I will always be there. That's one time always is always.  You can call him after dinner but... +++$+++ 1990s
Kay, um... how, uh, fast does this thing actually go ... ? +++$+++ 1990s
But he's the head of InGen! +++$+++ 1990s
Is that a problem? +++$+++ 2010s
Good to see you, son. +++$+++ 1980s
Sit down, man. Need a beer? +++$+++ 2000s
Yes -- yes indeed -- but you are a...  ...a stenographer. Don't little stenographers earn little pennies? +++$+++ 1930s
I don't mean everyone.  Just people who can do things because they can arrest people or convict them.  Or run a newspaper. +++$+++ 1990s
What's this? +++$+++ 1980s
Any old where ... but not our little Richard ... oh no! When you're not thumping them pagan skins, you're tormenting your eyes wid that rubbish! +++$+++ 1960s
With the forty thousand dollars? +++$+++ 1960s

Not even then. The police are the proper people to conduct this affair. Now if you've got any suspicions I'll drive you to the nearest police station. +++$+++ 1930s
Now you're going to have to tell me more. +++$+++ 2000s
I guess I don't have a hell of a lot of choice. +++$+++ 2000s
I'm sure this beautiful room must appeal to your taste -- distinctive, don't you think? Velvet upholstery -- 'A-number one'. I'm in the textile trade and I know.  And these are real silk drapes. +++$+++ 1930s
You'd better make a move kid.  He thinks you're trying to screw him. +++$+++ 1980s
Hello? +++$+++ 2000s
Well, we're FBI agents. +++$+++ 1990s
That woman's gonna call the cops. +++$+++ 2000s
I... +++$+++ 2000s
You fuckin' worm, if you're going out, I'm going out. +++$+++ 1980s
Why not? +++$+++ 1940s
What? +++$+++ 1960s
Isn't there something you... +++$+++ 1970s
There's only one Chinese restaurant in town, darling, the owners are Irish and Irish people happen to cook Cantonese.  They don't know better. +++$+++ 1980s
You weren't looking for company, were you? +++$+++ 1950s
Stop pointing your fuckin' gun at daddy! +++$+++ 1990s
I think you probably would -- if you didn't know I was right. +++$+++ 1990s
What things? +++$+++ 1980s
You're right.  I told you I was bad at acting. +++$+++ 1990s
What are you running away from? +++$+++ 1960s
Looks like... our old friend Mr. Codeine. That should take the pinch out of my ankle.  Have one. +++$+++ 2000s
I'm giving you Clint outside. +++$+++ 1990s
The Borg will undoubtedly attack. Set phasers to rotating modulation. +++$+++ 1990s
No.  I'm just depressed. +++$+++ 1980s
Sounds like you hooked up with some fine citizens, Flynne. +++$+++ 2000s
You're taking advantage of a minor. +++$+++ 1980s
Well, it's only the truth. There are horrible things in the world, Rose. +++$+++ 1990s
The paperwork, couldn't stand the paperwork.  Over to the left please, if you don't mind sir. Hold it there. Yes, there's more bits of paper in Central Services than bits of pipe - read this, fill in that, hand in the other - listen, this old system of yours could be on fire and I couldn't even turn on the kitchen tap without filling in a 27B/6.... Bloody paperwork. +++$+++ 1980s
He's right. +++$+++ 1990s
Of course I can. Drink or she dies.  Unlike you, she won't come back from where she's going. +++$+++ 2000s
And I do it because they do it, and they do it - it's a vicious circle, isn't it?  I'm going over to Georgie's, Brad - you know, Georgie, don't you? +++$+++ 1940s
You mad at me? +++$+++ 2000s
You expect him? +++$+++ 2000s
Paden. +++$+++ 1980s
The timing has never seemed quite right. +++$+++ 1990s
You're really pure, you know?  You got a perfect record.  You never used that stuff to ruin your body, why start now? +++$+++ 1970s
I don't know. +++$+++ 2000s
I didn't mean to start that.... +++$+++ 1980s
What is it? +++$+++ 2000s
Raise 300. +++$+++ 1970s
You're not a moron. +++$+++ 1990s
So you're Buzz's boy. I've been expecting you. You hurt my feelings when you didn't come and see me sooner. +++$+++ 1990s
Baxter, I picked you for my team because I thought you were a bright young man. You realize what you're doing? Not to me -- but to yourself. Normally it takes years to work your way up to the twenty-seventh floor -- but it takes only thirty seconds to be out on the street again. You dig? +++$+++ 1960s
No. +++$+++ 1970s
I know. Amazing. +++$+++ 1990s
And what makes you think you killed a man? +++$+++ 1980s
Jesus Christ, Michael, then let's hit 'em now, while we still got the muscle. +++$+++ 1970s
There, look! +++$+++ 1990s
Is it?  William says now you have requested a British Commission, why not colonial?  I'll clear it up for you, sir, because as a British officer you can lord over colonial yokels -- more than that, it will even get you into polite society! Your dream come true, George, the only dream that really matters to you. +++$+++ 2000s
Well, I think you're the fucking Anti-Christ. +++$+++ 2000s
They were ready to blame him for anything, no matter where it happened. +++$+++ 1990s
We did it.  We did it. +++$+++ 1990s
He's going to take his foot off slowly, David. Then you're to go home, like a good boy. You hear me? +++$+++ 1990s
If they don't take me out before then. [As an afterthought] What's the net? +++$+++ 2000s
I drew my gun, ran in the direction of the cries...violating the first rule of service...I let the Ambass- ador out of my sight. +++$+++ 2000s
We’ve got to get out. +++$+++ 1990s
Several problems with that theory. For one thing, this egg is intact. For another, according to Pendergast, the crates were shipped here on a boat.  Everyone on board was killed like Beauregard.  If the thing hatched in mid-ocean, where did it go? +++$+++ 1990s
Fit? You want to check my teeth.  Good crowd today. I think you'll have some fun. You going to stay for dinner? +++$+++ 1990s
Moishe, please, don't talk. +++$+++ 1990s
Yes. Yes, I'm here! +++$+++ 1990s
Much as I'd like to help you and our valued guests, I'm afraid I can't. +++$+++ 1990s
Because I took some sleeping pills. But I'm all right now -- so let's go. +++$+++ 1960s
We're focusing. +++$+++ 1970s
I never did.  Or the whole idea of an afterlife.  But I don't know any more.  I have these dreams about... your mom... and we have long talks about... about you, and how you are, which she sort of knows but I tell her anyway.  So what is that? It's sort of an afterlife, isn't it? +++$+++ 1990s
Let's go! +++$+++ 1990s
It's not like you laid the eggs yourself. +++$+++ 1990s
Seems to be back to normal, sir. +++$+++ 1990s
TALBY! +++$+++ 1970s
I'm usually nervous myself on first dates...but not tonight. It's funny, but somehow, I feel like....like I know you. +++$+++ 1980s
What's going on, Logan?! +++$+++ 1970s
Then the other Lyssa will share your fate. She will grow old in the Fortress as you have grown old here. +++$+++ 1980s
Never heard of him. +++$+++ 1990s
I haven't heard that song in ages.  The Ronettes? +++$+++ 1990s
I'd better press your evening clothes, sir.  You have not for- gotten Madame's New Year's party. +++$+++ 1950s
An Agent!  You have to send me back! +++$+++ 1990s
That doesn't sound so bad, come on, we'll never find that streamer. +++$+++ 1990s
Oh, I know, was it possibly when your ass was rotting in jail and I broke it out? Yeah, you're right, that was pretty fuckin' nutty. Not to mention stupid. But you know what? I can fix that right now. +++$+++ 1990s
I'd better go see how he's doing. +++$+++ 1970s
I'm fine. +++$+++ 1970s
You're in the Malahide Institute. It's a psychiatric hospital. But, hey, don't feel judged -- it was just the nearest place to bring you. Remember? You and your boyfriend...? +++$+++ 1980s
You say that like it's a bad thing. +++$+++ 1990s
Tonight? +++$+++ 1980s
You know him? +++$+++ 2000s
What is your name? +++$+++ 1970s
You're right, let's knock it down. +++$+++ 1990s
Well -- as I see it we've got two choices. We can hang around here and wait for the bomb to go off, or we can go to my party. +++$+++ 1970s
...is as dangerous as you seem to think it is, I'm gettin' my ass as far away from you and it as possible. +++$+++ 1990s
What do you mean? +++$+++ 1930s
Sam, I'm going. +++$+++ 1960s
Feel? I dunno... Happy. +++$+++ 1970s
Good idea. +++$+++ 1990s
I should like you to do something for me. It's an innocent sort of thing but I'm very set on it. +++$+++ 1960s
You were right about Joe, he is going somewhere -- +++$+++ 1990s
Madeleine, I... there are certain things... feelings... we must not voice. +++$+++ 2000s
Viva la Resistance. +++$+++ 1990s
Ten, nine... +++$+++ 1990s
Well, he passed on. He was killed in a motor accident in Italy. +++$+++ 1930s
See? +++$+++ 1950s
Hmmmm.  He'll be in the Zen Room. +++$+++ 1970s
No. You can't trust her. +++$+++ 1980s
Really? +++$+++ 1990s
What do you mean? +++$+++ 1990s
I suppose the idea was specialized training. +++$+++ 1960s
That's the way it was told to me. +++$+++ 1980s
Hooker! +++$+++ 1970s
I wouldn't wait if I were you. +++$+++ 1930s
Slower! In... Out... +++$+++ 1980s
I haven't seen you cry since you were a baby. This must be serious.  Where'd you meet him? +++$+++ 1930s
Oh -- all right. +++$+++ 1930s
Oh, no. Not Owens, not.... Wai', wai', wait. <u>I'm Owens</u>. Right? +++$+++ 2000s
I stand corrected Mr. Decker.  Navigator, lay in a conic section flight path into the cloud center; bring us parallel to whatever we find in there... +++$+++ 1970s
Stop it! I'm just trying to say I think we should take our friendship to the next level. +++$+++ 2000s
You actually said that?!  Haaaah!! +++$+++ 1990s
Well...I think you should feel very proud. You did a real nice thing for somebody else. I'm very proud. +++$+++ 1990s
The Sheriff has just received four more letters threatening his life, but he says nothing can interfere with his duty. +++$+++ 1940s
Do something... +++$+++ 1990s
That's why I'm calling, Miss Price... +++$+++ 1970s
And our people? +++$+++ 1990s
Magda! +++$+++ 1990s
Bela, what happened?! +++$+++ 1990s
What -- what are you doing? +++$+++ 1980s
We have to tell her she's in danger! +++$+++ 2000s
I need a cigarette!  She left my office four years ago, we're looking for a chart...  I need a cigarette... +++$+++ 1970s
Pressure? +++$+++ 1990s
You wouldn't believe me. I mean, people always say, "You wouldn't believe me", but in this case, it's not even worth trying. +++$+++ 2000s
You've got to pick three more numbers. +++$+++ 1980s
I was in the basement fixing the pipes.  Would you believe that? +++$+++ 1980s
Yeah. +++$+++ 1960s
No, Major, I merely wish to state that your vehicle appears to be somewhat slower and heavier than mine, and point out that, if you would be kind enough to pull over to one side of the road, I could pass you and be on my way. +++$+++ 1990s
Got to learn, like I'm a-learnin'. Don't know it right yet myself, but I'm tryin' to fin' out. That's why I can't ever be a preacher again. Preacher got to *know*.  I don't. I got to *ask*. +++$+++ 1940s
No, he's not. +++$+++ 1990s
That's the "why."  That's the why? There is no reason.  No good reason; no bad reason.  To live or to die. +++$+++ 2000s
Hurry up, would you? +++$+++ 1990s
Well, that's a load off. +++$+++ 1990s
Did they hurtcha? +++$+++ 1930s
Let me. +++$+++ 1980s
Mike? +++$+++ 1980s
Good swell. +++$+++ 1970s
So something please Doctor, Help her! +++$+++ 1970s
... was so romantic. +++$+++ 1990s
Yeah. This land to be bought by contributions from the boys. You have that. Money to be-- +++$+++ 1930s
I'm not hungry.  What's wrong?  I spent all morning on that soup.  I thought you liked Worm's Wart. +++$+++ 1990s
I said I wonder if you could help me. +++$+++ 1960s
Perfectionist. +++$+++ 1970s
Sit down, Gino! +++$+++ 1990s
I thought we were poor. +++$+++ 1980s
I made the CUT THE LINE gesture. You nodded okay.' +++$+++ 1990s
Willie, shut up.  Yo' old ass need to get in a little bit o' trouble sometimes. +++$+++ 2000s
It's for school, for summer writing class. +++$+++ 1990s
Cold. +++$+++ 2000s
A private investigator... You’re not Austrian? +++$+++ 1990s
Be that as it may. U is for Unconditional Election. God has chosen a certain number of people to be saved, The Elect, and He has chosen them from the beginning of time. L is for Limited Atonement. Only a limited number will be atoned, will go to Heaven. +++$+++ 1970s
I never really thought they'd go for it.  And then... you didn't come forward, they investigated my war record...  I kept expecting you to show up and expose me... +++$+++ 1990s
You're right.  I must've made a mistake. +++$+++ 2000s
Yes. +++$+++ 2000s
To begin, I put money out on the streets, chargin' three points a week. You know - juice to the fuckin' dealers. +++$+++ 1990s
Orvolle. His wine.  From now on, nothing but water at every meal -- +++$+++ 2000s
I know a very good dentist. +++$+++ 1940s
Yes you can. You're going to make it, Scully. +++$+++ 1990s
And give a deposition to the jUdge. +++$+++ 1990s
Somebody planted that fucking story! And somebody tipped off the press I'm one of Garrison's fucking suspects.  I can't go home. I'm out on the street.  The maggots are everywhere!  Do you know what you've done to me?  It's all over the national news now.  You know what you've done to me? +++$+++ 1990s
She could be under sedatives, sleeping.  He's in the room now. +++$+++ 1950s
Nothing. +++$+++ 1990s
How much do you make a week, Niki? +++$+++ 1970s
Pretty darn clear. +++$+++ 1990s
I love you, my little Leonitchka! +++$+++ 1930s
Where are we going? +++$+++ 2000s
That's wonderful. I think you should... fresh air. +++$+++ 1970s
But don't worry, man. Things are all sweetness and light here... +++$+++ 2000s
In the den. +++$+++ 1970s
Any sign of Lindenmeyer? +++$+++ 1990s
Shit!  He sent them all. +++$+++ 1980s
Good evening. You see, here we are again. +++$+++ 1940s
How far are you going to? +++$+++ 1970s
You're kidding yourself.  An adult T-rex cares about one thing -- filling its own belly.  It acts the way people wish they could, that's why everyone's fascinated by it.  If people had the chance to see one dinosaur and one only, ninety-nine percent would -- +++$+++ 1990s
I'm still here, Doc. +++$+++ 1970s
Fine, I'll stop. +++$+++ 1990s
I'm not worried about you.  I'm worried about the safe. +++$+++ 1980s
Why? +++$+++ 1990s
You what? +++$+++ 1930s
It's the tension. +++$+++ 1990s
Monica. +++$+++ 2000s
Why did you break into that particular building? +++$+++ 2000s
Gray -- I'm rid of him -- +++$+++ 1940s
Oh, now I'll never get home! +++$+++ 1930s
If this is meant to be a joke it is not funny. Or do you still think you're issuing orders from your palace in Petrograd? +++$+++ 1930s
No. I don't want it to. +++$+++ 2000s
I'll consider it. +++$+++ 1990s
Especially tenor sax.  I don't know what it is, but they just curdle me.  All they have to do is play eight bars of "Come to Me My Melancholy Baby" - and my spine turns to custard, and I get goose-pimply all over - and I come to them. +++$+++ 1950s
Look, you'll be back in town tomorrow night. We'll have dinner -- talk it over. +++$+++ 1980s
What would you say if you knew it was me who brought down Bill Parrish?  I told Drew and the Board that Bill depended on you.  Drew led me on, but I had no business telling him in the first place.  He was setting up Bill from day one.  Drew and Bontecou are going to chop up the company and sell it off for parts. Bontecou was outside, Drew was Mr. Inside.  And I was the fool who made it all happen.  Oh God, what do I do? +++$+++ 1990s
Maybe I just live here, what do you think about that? +++$+++ 1990s
Here? In Berkeley? +++$+++ 1960s
Fifty dollars? +++$+++ 1990s
Fifteen meters. +++$+++ 1980s
Amateurs! +++$+++ 1930s
Just doesn't, that's all. +++$+++ 1990s
Who did they get for that? +++$+++ 1990s
Zero emotional developments. Total lack of compassion. A highly developed psychopathic instinct to survive. +++$+++ 1990s
I got him in the stomach. +++$+++ 1970s
Don't rush ever'body, honey. +++$+++ 1990s
Any others? +++$+++ 1990s
Not so fast.  Who's that? +++$+++ 1990s
The Case that I am <u>working</u> on... +++$+++ 2000s
Will the Company put up five hundred dollars to get Jane McKenna's list of clients? +++$+++ 1970s
It's alright. +++$+++ 2000s
Here's what this is...ask how much they want to turn back to us our load... +++$+++ 2000s
That time you sent me up last ... I learned book-keeping at Sing Sing.  I figured it might be an in for me somewhere's. +++$+++ 1930s
Who is he, Pop? +++$+++ 1950s
Are you hungry?  What's your favorite food?  We'll try to get it for you. +++$+++ 1990s
Comrades! People of the world! The revolution is on the march... I know... wars will wash over us... bombs will fall... all civilization will crumble... but not yet, please... wait, wait... what's the hurry?  Let us be happy... give us our moment....  We are happy, aren't we, Leon? +++$+++ 1930s
Your mother wasn't one to get chased off her patch. Half the damn county knew and nobody thought the worse of her for seein' it through. +++$+++ 1990s
Why was the floor wet? +++$+++ 1990s
When can you leave? +++$+++ 2000s
Maybe Cotton Weary is telling the truth. Maybe he was having an affair with your mom. +++$+++ 1990s
Hola, bienvenido +++$+++ 1990s
Jesus, the road! +++$+++ 1980s
We can't really leave that poor man here alone. +++$+++ 1970s
So where is he? +++$+++ 1990s
Oh, excuse me.  This is -- uh -- this is -- +++$+++ 1990s
Mr. Carpenter -- what does velocity mean? +++$+++ 2000s
There was no ad in the Times. +++$+++ 2000s
I'm just like him. +++$+++ 1990s
Alright...alright...you've saved my ass enough times.  What do you want to do? +++$+++ 2000s
Quick! In the house. He won't look for us in there. +++$+++ 2000s
Are you her boyfriend? +++$+++ 1990s
What? +++$+++ 1980s
Getting there. +++$+++ 2000s
I think she's going to be all right. +++$+++ 1970s
I won't let him hurt you! He just wants what you know! +++$+++ 2000s
You've been out of your room. +++$+++ 1990s
How do I know if this is love ? +++$+++ 1990s
'Remembrance'. +++$+++ 1950s
He won't eh? - We'll see about that - send for your father immediately. +++$+++ 1930s
Well, where are you going? +++$+++ 1990s
Who are you going after next, sir? +++$+++ 1990s
Jack - - please - - WIPE THAT LUNATIC GRIN OFF YOUR FACE. +++$+++ 1980s
I like the sound of that. +++$+++ 2000s
Wha -- what do you want? +++$+++ 1960s
Oh, Letty, what happened? +++$+++ 2000s
Rogan, Laurel. You also have a Rogan, Lillian. She won't need it. Sell it. +++$+++ 2000s
So if you give us the pregnant lady's number, we can warn her about the lake and she'll live long enough to have the baby. +++$+++ 2000s
They coulda danced a jig on it an' fed it to goats -- don't matter.  Ya' can't kill Jason by gettin' rid of his body.  He'll come back the way he always do, to drag the kiddies into the darkness and crush their little skulls -- maybe even your skull, Mr. Campbell. +++$+++ 1990s
The chief says to tell you how sorry he is. He knew Sam Baffert was a good man. +++$+++ 1990s
Money isn't the only reason people commit murder, Miss Braslow. +++$+++ 1990s
Do you know what I'm looking at Robert? +++$+++ 1990s
Thank you, sir. +++$+++ 1930s
Are you crazy? I've unleashed a psycho on her. She's gonna be fucking pissed.  She's even more beautiful than I remember. +++$+++ 1990s
That happens. +++$+++ 1980s
I thought you'd be interested. I'd like you to be in on everything, Annie. Not just the finished book, but how it's written. +++$+++ 1990s
Bugger the Buffs. +++$+++ 1980s
Well, thanks for coming. +++$+++ 1990s
You're very direct, Mr. Felson. +++$+++ 1960s
I want to now who I'm talking to. +++$+++ 1990s
Do you swear on all the Holy Saints in heaven? +++$+++ 1990s
Only you think you're lucky because you didn't have a mother who said things to you and did things to you that maybe weren't always nice but that was because of me, because I was bad, not her. +++$+++ 1980s
What? +++$+++ 1990s
Maybe you need to start. +++$+++ 2000s
I've got something important to do. I can't leave. +++$+++ 1970s
Oh, Jesus, come on, will you? Don't mess this up anymore than it's already been messed up. Join the other kids. Do that and before you know it you'll be as happy as a goddamned clam. +++$+++ 1990s
I wish you'd tell Alice that.  And that Goddamn Mrs. Wheeler. +++$+++ 1970s
I strongly doubt it, but I wasn't really discussing media... +++$+++ 1970s
You're no Venus de Milo. +++$+++ 1940s
Ohhhh -- +++$+++ 1930s
What'd you see, who was she with, where were they going? +++$+++ 2000s
Who knows? Guys a lot smarter than me are dropping out like flies. +++$+++ 1980s
L.A. is in a constant state of warfare. Gangs fighting for the right to rule. +++$+++ 1990s
You can't fight'em that way... +++$+++ 1990s
Just for the criminals. +++$+++ 1990s
Oh Lord! I'd do just about anything for that! +++$+++ 1990s
What is it? Where's Casey? +++$+++ 1990s
Where are you going?! +++$+++ 1980s
You mean besides kicking your ass?! +++$+++ 1990s
I have little time for your mercenary concerns, but I am grateful for the service you have given to our cause.  What is your price? +++$+++ 1970s
Baby, you're so money you don't even know it. +++$+++ 1990s
Twombley's shot. I heard that. Not Jack. He's okay, I assume. +++$+++ 1990s
Nonsense!  You look great --  Look, uh, why don't you lie down and take a little nap?  We'll film around you for a while. +++$+++ 1990s
Some meeting.  With PG&E people. +++$+++ 2000s
No!  Cocoa Puffs on Top -- Fruit Loops on the bottom. +++$+++ 1990s
This isn't me.  We can show clients endless options, change anything in a matter of hours on the computer.  But you won't change. +++$+++ 2000s
I am a fool. +++$+++ 1990s
Christ, Ted, I was only four towns away. +++$+++ 1990s
Through the ass. +++$+++ 1970s
Was that it? +++$+++ 1990s
Just ask if they can recall recommending my services to anyone in the recent past. Say you’re my secretary, all right? +++$+++ 1990s
How long were you having sex with him? +++$+++ 1990s
He's in Engineering, sir...  He doesn't know. +++$+++ 1970s
Was she ever a suspect? +++$+++ 1990s
He's my son. +++$+++ 1990s
Whatta we do now? +++$+++ 2000s
How about yourself? +++$+++ 1990s
Hi. Is Annette at home? +++$+++ 1990s
Transference! +++$+++ 1990s
That is you there, ain't it, Bob? The Duck of Death? +++$+++ 1990s
A headache? +++$+++ 1990s
Who cares? +++$+++ 1990s
Oh my God, sir! +++$+++ 1990s
I'm sorry, Neil. +++$+++ 1980s
Do you have great devotion for the Virgin? +++$+++ 1960s
I won't ask why you would want to help someone trying to kill you, but hey, good job.  Shall we? +++$+++ 1990s
Who?  Where d'you think they come from! +++$+++ 1950s
Well then, I suggest you have a seat on the bench behind you and think of something a little juicier to confess than losing KISS tickets. I realize this is Detroit, but I personally find, what that rock and roll band is all about, to be boring as Lucifer's kingdom. I'll return in a little while. +++$+++ 1990s
He's a Selectman. The town. He said to tell you to turn your badge in and clean out your office. I'm supposed to pull the CB and police light out of your car. They're town property. +++$+++ 1990s
No thanks. +++$+++ 1970s
Yes, very cosy for a family, and if you feel like spreading out you have the rest of the hotel to move around in. +++$+++ 1980s
What an awful sound! +++$+++ 1970s
No! They said no cops! They were darned clear on that, Wade! They said you call the cops and we - +++$+++ 1990s
I had to be the ham! I had to shoot off my mouth! +++$+++ 1950s
I'll take some. +++$+++ 1980s
No, no, please! +++$+++ 1990s
Yes. Why? +++$+++ 1960s
Oh. Carrots.  And peas.  None of the important ones. +++$+++ 1980s
Took it out the bathroom window. Buried it in the woods. +++$+++ 1990s
She'll drive herself. +++$+++ 2010s
Well, if you change your mind. What's this friend's name? +++$+++ 1980s
Nobody just scuttles a passenger liner either. +++$+++ 2000s
1961?  '62?  Mary Clarence, that's when many of us took final vows.  It's the last secular music we recall. +++$+++ 1990s
I wouldn't know who to bet on. +++$+++ 2000s
Would you like to have a cool drink, David? +++$+++ 1970s
You shouldn't a done that. +++$+++ 2000s
Yeah. +++$+++ 2000s
Come on, Jean. Get rid of your cigarette. Concentrate. +++$+++ 1990s
<u>Do</u> it... +++$+++ 2000s
EVERYBODY SHUT UP! Let the man speak. +++$+++ 1990s
...-lem? +++$+++ 1990s
Oh, that's nice-- +++$+++ 1990s
He's doing his best. +++$+++ 1980s
Would you like to know what's in it? The report. +++$+++ 1970s
Open the door. We're late. +++$+++ 1990s
No. This is nothing, Dewey. I'll be okay. Go back to work and let me get back to my quasi pseudo-happy existence. +++$+++ 1990s
Where does he work? +++$+++ 2000s
We are in a dungeon. How do we get out? +++$+++ 1980s
Just horseshit luck. +++$+++ 1990s
A script!  I thought we just walked through everything... +++$+++ 1990s
"Fun?"  Jesus, "<u>fun</u>?"  I kill myself for a year and a half, hand you the best case of your life on a God damn silver platter, remind you of why you became a lawyer in the first place, and you think of me as "fun?" +++$+++ 2000s
Jeff--this is Mr. Taylor. +++$+++ 1930s
You're a good man... She was right to have chosen you... +++$+++ 1990s
Mister, I'm calling you out. +++$+++ 1990s
I know. Don't tell me. It was a wonderful party. Your suit went over big. And she looked beautiful, and she gave her hand when you left her-- and said--"Thank you, Mr. Smith." Oh, but it was the way she *said* it. You like to fell through the floor--Horseradish! +++$+++ 1930s
You didn't know she had a boyfriend? +++$+++ 1990s
Daddy, *please*... +++$+++ 1990s
Yes, Mrs. Pressman. +++$+++ 1990s
I already have. +++$+++ 1990s
Guess what I am holding in my hand. You like guessing games? +++$+++ 2000s
You shot Roger. +++$+++ 1980s
They're comin' with us. +++$+++ 1990s
Natalie who? +++$+++ 2000s
Talk. Lovers murmuring to each other... +++$+++ 1980s
Oh my God! You're Rick Derris? +++$+++ 1990s
How are we going to find her?  There must be thousands of white vans in this state. +++$+++ 2000s
No. Stay. I want you close to me. This couch is wrong. It's not a "married couch." +++$+++ 2000s
I'm Bobby Clowes. Kansas City. +++$+++ 1990s
The speeders should be ready in the morning.  They'll make the search easier. +++$+++ 1980s
Happy anniversary. +++$+++ 2000s
What if <u>what</u>? +++$+++ 1990s
Look, I know why you like him. I know why everyone likes him. But I need you to tell me I'm not crazy. +++$+++ 2000s
I'm a pilot, Will. This is where I belong. +++$+++ 1990s
Get off the radio! +++$+++ 1990s
I made an appointment with Father Phillip McNulty at St. Bernard's. We're to see him directly where he will register you on the spot. +++$+++ 1990s
Oh god. I'm overbearing and rude. Lily. Lily Finn. +++$+++ 2000s
There's sort of a built-in prayer for the sick man to get well, but of course that's not the basic intention. +++$+++ 1970s
Look kid, I know what it's like, I was a kid, too.  Even stole a Horse once.  But you can't-- +++$+++ 1990s
Bubba. +++$+++ 2000s
Jessie!  Are you alright? +++$+++ 1990s
Yes, Dr Scott.  A laser capable of emitting a beam of pure anti-matter. +++$+++ 1970s
Yeah, well, that's enough. +++$+++ 2000s
How old are you? +++$+++ 1950s
Man! Our first date and already you're trying to get me to change! You French women work quick! +++$+++ 1990s
"Fuck"? You think I don't know this word "fuck"? Is that how you talk to policemen in America? +++$+++ 1990s
Mr. Decker... I will contact you every five minutes. Otherwise... inform Mr. Scott immediately. +++$+++ 1970s
Why? +++$+++ 1990s
Carl's a jerk! +++$+++ 1990s
What'd I say? +++$+++ 2000s
I can't do it. +++$+++ 2000s
The public demands justice, sir. This was a full-fledged riot of policemen.  Shift the guilt to men whose pensions are secured.  Force them to retire.  But someone has to swing.  Indict, try and convict Stensland and Bud White.  Secure them jail time.  Feed them to the sharks, sir.  Protect yourself; protect the department. +++$+++ 1990s
I didn't realise! Those were de-caps! I didn't know that....de-caps... revived! +++$+++ 1980s
Ah. +++$+++ 1990s
That's right. Not my style, Reggie.. +++$+++ 1980s
All right, folks, get on your mark. When you hear the pistol shot-- +++$+++ 1930s
I am sure.  I mean to report it. It's like Burke and Hare all over again. +++$+++ 1940s
I want to wake up. I want to wake up, that's all. I-- +++$+++ 1980s
Boy, if we were inside, I know how to forge us a Group 6 access... +++$+++ 1980s
Hold your arm out. You can't hope to be cured quickly. You heard what the doctor said. If it had been seen to in time ...This'll take time. But with the help of God, we'll pull through. +++$+++ 1960s
You don't have fifty foot of apartment! +++$+++ 2000s
You want to do this some other time? +++$+++ 2000s
We'll bury him. +++$+++ 1990s
I inherited that money when I was thirteen, when my father died. +++$+++ 1990s
I know my treasure. +++$+++ 1990s
Waitaminit, dudes! I got it! Maybe we can glue the tickets back together! +++$+++ 1990s
Hey. I said what I saw. Two kids arguing. A guy and a girl. +++$+++ 2000s
My job, my rules. We've got a job to do. No mixing business and pleasure. +++$+++ 1990s
Your Honor: I imagine that, no matter how careful my questioning, Mr. Ortega would, in his well-intentioned way, dig my client's hole even deeper. +++$+++ 1980s
Well put. So, what exactly has uncle Terrence been up to lately? +++$+++ 1990s
I'm buying bananas tonight. +++$+++ 1990s
You said it. +++$+++ 1980s
I wasn't sneaking around with your girl.  Would you please tell him? +++$+++ 1970s
Where the hell is he? +++$+++ 1980s
Johnny Cammareri. I think it's great and about time. What's she gonna do with the rest of her life she don't get married? +++$+++ 1980s
Oh please. You're blind as a bat. +++$+++ 1990s
You can tie whoever did it to Sandra Van Ryan... +++$+++ 1990s
I don't like her. +++$+++ 1990s
I'll get it for you. Ibuprofen or aspirin? +++$+++ 2000s
We can't just go off and-- +++$+++ 1990s
Good night. +++$+++ 1990s
She didn't like me... I made a fool of myself... +++$+++ 1990s
That's horseshit and you know it. +++$+++ 2000s
-- no. +++$+++ 1990s
I'm a junior. +++$+++ 2000s
Good thing you have a voice-over career. +++$+++ 2000s
Isn't it a bit too late to be out? You've brought me the sword? +++$+++ 2000s
What's the matter? Afraid papa will spank? +++$+++ 1930s
Mom, this is the guy that drove us home that afternoon we were stuck on the highway. The guy you yelled at for no good reason... +++$+++ 2000s
Every other Sunday.  I'm heavyweight champion of the West Virginia. +++$+++ 2000s
Forget it.  I was reading. +++$+++ 1980s
Yes. +++$+++ 1990s
Don't you think that's a little psycho? A little weird? +++$+++ 1990s
Bill, thanks for coming over...  And how're you doing today, Drew?  You've got a firecracker here, the kid's really set the table. +++$+++ 1990s
You want 'em all arrested? +++$+++ 1950s
Otho, that's terrible. +++$+++ 1980s
Well, this one's yours now. You ready to take care of it? +++$+++ 2000s
What happened with Rick? +++$+++ 1940s
I have no idea what to say. How to act. What if I do the wrong thing? +++$+++ 2000s
I could see she likes you. +++$+++ 1950s
I'm gonna propose. +++$+++ 2000s
Who's setting you up in this place? +++$+++ 2000s
No comment! +++$+++ 1990s
Wait a minute. +++$+++ 1990s
So you're a one-girl guy? +++$+++ 1990s
We're just talking about the... +++$+++ 2000s
Zat what it takes?  I always <u>wondered</u> what it took... +++$+++ 2000s
I know what he'll say.  He'll say that acting is just a whim and that it's frivolous and that I should forget about it.  He'll tell me how they're counting on me and to put it out of my mind "for my own good." +++$+++ 1980s
Hey, you going to watch or you going to do? +++$+++ 1990s
They haven't done the standard scratch test. Where they make small injections into the skin? +++$+++ 1990s
That checks out with our finding, thank you, Mr. Dahlberg. +++$+++ 1970s
OK. Same again? +++$+++ 1990s
Yeah? +++$+++ 1980s
I know. +++$+++ 1980s
I teach part time at the Junior College.  What if I told you I was through with Nuke?  He learned his lessons quickly and left me. +++$+++ 1980s
I'm sorry. +++$+++ 1990s
Yes. It's very cold outside today, isn't it, Thomas? +++$+++ 1970s
Yes I do. +++$+++ 2000s
Look, if you don't mind, I haven't got time to listen to the whole plot ... +++$+++ 1950s
Why is your beard so funny? Let me touch this. +++$+++ 1990s
Can you tell her I'll ring her back. +++$+++ 1990s
Well . . . uh . . . I . . . +++$+++ 1930s
Hey... what the hell you doing? +++$+++ 1990s
We can't fire, sir; they've damaged the photon controls and the warp drive. We must withdraw! +++$+++ 1980s
Now, find your power animal. +++$+++ 1990s
What's ailing that dog? +++$+++ 2000s
Books, records, films -- these things matter.  Call me shallow but it's the damn truth, and by this measure I was having one of the best dates of my life. +++$+++ 2000s
I understand you perfectly. You leave that girl alone, you wretched man, or you will be sorry. +++$+++ 1990s
Like what. +++$+++ 1990s
We'd better get everybody online.  And Kyle, Stop downloading porn.  Your frame rate is unacceptable. +++$+++ 1990s
Ho -- ho --ho +++$+++ 1930s
Take a look. Son of a bitch won't feel a thing until it's too late. +++$+++ 1980s
Not an option. Just get up slowly like everything's cool. Petra, trust me. You just hung yourself out to dry for me, I'm not gonna let you down. +++$+++ 2000s
It's a Movado. +++$+++ 1970s
Okay!  Look, Buffy.  You want to play house with the unwashed masses, that's fine.  But personally, I think you ought to spend a little time prioritizing.  I really do. +++$+++ 1990s
Then go get him. +++$+++ 1980s
Maybe you should just drop us off. I'm sure we can find someone willing to take the risk. +++$+++ 1970s
I won't panic. +++$+++ 1970s
Oh, babe... +++$+++ 1980s
Our 'kind'?  What is that supposed to mean?  These men are all I have left and they stay because they will fight!  They desire it!  They seek it!  Of course Virginia is terrified!  For my soldiers this is a war to obliterate the 'upper class' from the face of the earth! Should I tell them all to go home because if they win it will ruin me!?  It is impossible for me to imagine that Negroes are fighting so that only white men may be free! If we win this war they will own this country too! +++$+++ 2000s
...they treat me like a <u>child</u>.  I, I...to bare my <u>body</u>. +++$+++ 2000s
My subscription lapsed three years ago... +++$+++ 1970s
Sportsmanship! That's my point. June fly, Ed? Mosquito? Which of these? Well, what fish do you seek? +++$+++ 2000s
...that changes all my plans, I thought you were loaded... +++$+++ 1980s
-- All right. I tried to reason with you. I tried everything. Now I want those letters. Get them for me. +++$+++ 1940s
Haven't you been listening? +++$+++ 1980s
But you're troubled... aren't you? +++$+++ 1980s
That's pretty. +++$+++ 1930s
Who is he? +++$+++ 1990s
If you are killed in the Matrix, you die here? +++$+++ 1990s
If only Brad could have found it within his heart to say these things to me. +++$+++ 1980s
Oh, baby, you cruel... +++$+++ 1990s
An experiment? Hey, I've seen you before. +++$+++ 1980s
You're welcome to join our club. +++$+++ 1990s
I think I'll...carry him. +++$+++ 1970s
Stupid cunt! +++$+++ 1990s
Heck, you don't know! You're just whistlin' Dixie here! I'm sayin', the cops, they can advise us on this! I'm sayin' call a professional! +++$+++ 1990s
One thousand feet.  Pull the goddamn cord! +++$+++ 1990s
I can't. +++$+++ 1990s
You stole her purse!  While you were saving her? +++$+++ 1990s
I need to ask you questions of a psychological nature. +++$+++ 1980s
A little birdie whispered in my ear today... about the needle-candy you're chasing.  It's up here...  ... in the old curiosity shop. +++$+++ 2000s
It's a secret so don't tell anyone. Some day I'll show you where. I've gotta go to sleep now. +++$+++ 1980s
That's when I'll get my confidence back. +++$+++ 1970s
She's prepared to testify that she was instructed to do this by one of Edgar Sonrisa's managers.  You know who Sonrisa is? +++$+++ 1990s
Because she'll scare them away. +++$+++ 1990s
Hawk? +++$+++ 1990s
I'd better get going, do you need a hand to get into bed? +++$+++ 2000s
I mean -- on account of that policeman last night.  You think he's a bank robber, maybe? Or a gangster? +++$+++ 2000s
You shouldn't say that, you're the chairman --  ...uh, chairperson... +++$+++ 1980s
There's no joy in it for me. +++$+++ 2000s
No, I mean, is he trustworthy? Is his word -- +++$+++ 1940s
... taking Genesis away from us... +++$+++ 1980s
That sounds like a curse to me. +++$+++ 1980s
Leggo. I got to wash it out. +++$+++ 1990s
No.  I paid him off. +++$+++ 1990s
He's not home. +++$+++ 1940s
Don't give me that shit. I want my money. +++$+++ 1990s
I can make this wall without -- +++$+++ 1990s
Why?  Why, because you only told me about it? +++$+++ 1990s
How are you feeling, Norman? +++$+++ 1990s
It's the guard in the storeroom. +++$+++ 1980s
You've used up your grant. The electric bills alone exceed your annual salary.  Not to mention the potential hazards of your radioactive fuel. +++$+++ 2000s
Four seconds from... +++$+++ 1990s
Down... there. +++$+++ 1980s
What are you talking about? +++$+++ 1980s
Oh Brad. +++$+++ 1970s
Come on, Phil.  You're not gonna let this slide.  What about her parents?  What about what else she's published?  At least we should get the stuff to see if we find anything else that's an amazing real-life coincidence. +++$+++ 1990s
You wasn't with her? +++$+++ 1980s
What else can they do? +++$+++ 2000s
Brain injury. +++$+++ 1960s
Like a party for all our friends. +++$+++ 1990s
The air's laced with type two ozone, it reads as a solid. +++$+++ 2000s
Hang tough, Lloyd. +++$+++ 1980s
You could put it that way. +++$+++ 2000s
Wait. Don't draw any conclusions. Let me explain. +++$+++ 1940s
They always say that. +++$+++ 2000s
Go on, please -- five men -- $250,000 -- the French Underground -- +++$+++ 1960s
Separate bathrooms, darling. I will not lay out all my cosmetics for you to knock over. +++$+++ 1990s
What's the timer set for? +++$+++ 1980s
Too late. I've tried. I think you're right, Jake. I'm game. +++$+++ 1990s
And you ended up at UC Berkely -- +++$+++ 1990s
Shakespeare was French! The Queen Mother sucks cocks in hell! Shit! Fuck! Piss! +++$+++ 1980s
Not likely.  Once, yeah, I was -- but there wasn't an inch of profit in it, and I'm a cash oriented girl, if you take my meaning.  I'm a hired gun, same as the rest of you, and that's all any of us needs to know about the other. +++$+++ 1990s
Got it. +++$+++ 1990s
Never thought that pissant town would look so pretty. +++$+++ 2000s
Makes you cry +++$+++ 1970s
No. +++$+++ 1990s
Do tell. I love a good plan. +++$+++ 1990s
Yes, I understand. +++$+++ 1990s
Champagne please. +++$+++ 1990s
It was very well—hidden. There was no way to see it until it was too late. +++$+++ 1990s
... and you knew about this. +++$+++ 1990s
I'm coming up there Tim! I'm coming to get you!  Lex, I've got to get him! +++$+++ 1990s
Man, somebody really hung one on you!  I've heard some good ones for you guys... Humphrey Bogart, Harley Davidson.  I guess the people at immigration got a little punchy after a while, coming up with names for a quarter of a million of you. You weren't at the back of the line, were you, George? +++$+++ 1980s
But there's another side-- +++$+++ 1990s
These observers were doing something. A test...I think they sank that ship on purpose to cover up their mistakes. +++$+++ 1980s
Trust is earned not given away. +++$+++ 2000s
I come from a big one.  Nine of us. All in Minnesota, except me. +++$+++ 1950s
And sir, I also get that broken- mirror, black-cat, Friday-the- thirteenth kind of feeling about this one.... +++$+++ 1990s
Ok. +++$+++ 2000s
I'll be waiting.							   * +++$+++ 2000s
Jacob.  We've got to get to Amanda before it's too late. +++$+++ 1980s
Look, Todd, you're obviously under- estimating the value of this desk set. +++$+++ 1980s
Well, isn't this perhaps a good opportunity to... slip her one? +++$+++ 1990s
... Me, too. +++$+++ 1980s
How about once more around the park? +++$+++ 1960s
You're a menace! A walking pestilence. I do know who you are, Taylor. As I know that others of your kind must live in the Forbidden Zone.  You have just six hours to make a full confession. After that I'll employ surgery to obtain one.  Guards! +++$+++ 2000s
Do I? +++$+++ 2000s
They always let felons sit in on Honors Biology? +++$+++ 1990s
Y'see? That's the real point here. That's what I'm driving for, when the big storm comes and knocks down all the forests and the rocks fall down and the leave's are bare. What's left? The little trees, the little fellas that the storm didn't see. The tiny little... +++$+++ 1990s
He's a <u>bum</u>. +++$+++ 1990s
Oh Burke! Poor Burke! +++$+++ 1970s
Maybe they had weight limits, you don't know. +++$+++ 2000s
My pa wants to know...<U>Colonel</U> <U>Greenhill</U> wants to know how soon you could put a company of your Rangers in the field, fully armed and equipped, for joint punitive action against the Comanches. +++$+++ 1950s
I gave all that up.  I got tired of the lies. They wanted to stuff me in Levenworth to cover their asses on a botched assignment.  It got so I didn't know who to trust anymore...  ...some things never change, I guess. +++$+++ 2000s
Stop worrying, Deke. She was in a boat. +++$+++ 1960s
You haven't told then, huh? +++$+++ 1990s
We decided the night before last, before we came up here... +++$+++ 1950s
My pleasure. +++$+++ 1980s
Yeah, yeah, yeah. +++$+++ 1990s
In the lab.  With her, probably. +++$+++ 2000s
The killer leaves a newspaper clipping at each murder, Sidney. Recently he's also left a photo of your mother. +++$+++ 2000s
Yeah.  So how are you? +++$+++ 1970s
No, I don't belong here. +++$+++ 1970s
You got that right.  And we ain't brothers.  Maybe we should just end this right here. +++$+++ 2000s
Keep her out of here while I check it out. +++$+++ 1990s
Did he -- you know? +++$+++ 1990s
Comes with some Goddamn responsibility, like keeping your people in line. +++$+++ 2000s
You really want to know? +++$+++ 1990s
It's complicated and I don't want to go into it now, because it's bound to sound insulting--even though nobody means for anybody to be insulted.  It's just the truth. +++$+++ 1970s
It isn't Yankee whisky, Daddy, it's Scotch. +++$+++ 1990s
You know, I've always been fascinated by show business. +++$+++ 1950s
Does that worry you? +++$+++ 1970s
Somebody told her. +++$+++ 1980s
So alone. +++$+++ 1930s
Ha ha.  That's too much, Georgie.  Those days are over.  The rate is one-thousand dollars.  Inflation, you know? +++$+++ 2000s
...Yah -- well, at least, y'know, I got to perform. And Mom got to see me.  I guess number eight only worked for Diane Sawyer... +++$+++ 1990s
Full sentences.  As if she had been speaking all along. +++$+++ 2000s
Yes. +++$+++ 1990s
You hungry, son? +++$+++ 2000s
Hurry, Suzette. +++$+++ 1930s
You were not dead before. When I thought you dead, I did not care about all the plays that will never come, only that I would never see your face. I saw our end, and it will come. +++$+++ 1990s
You need not worry...Not just now, anyway. +++$+++ 1960s
For now the best thing we can do is to keep quiet about this. +++$+++ 2000s
I didn't know how to tell you.  A couple brokers stopped in for Stoley Spritzers one night.  Next thing I know Fast Track Digest votes us "Watering Hole of the Month."  Now, I'm shopping for Aqua Salmon wallpaper. +++$+++ 1990s
It's got into the pub!  It's turned on the stereo! +++$+++ 1980s
I was just about to ask Hanna to bring down iced tea.  I'd like it very much if you'd join me. +++$+++ 1990s
And what was that? +++$+++ 2000s
Sneaking in the back door. +++$+++ 1970s
Leave it -- I'll wash it for you. +++$+++ 1990s
Dr. Weir's right. Get on board the Event Horizon. I'll meet you at the airlock. +++$+++ 1990s
One. It's Ru'afo. +++$+++ 1990s
Well, don't worry.  I won't sue you - no matter who you are. +++$+++ 1950s
Charmed. +++$+++ 1980s
Aye, sir. +++$+++ 1990s
I just got here myself, Susan. +++$+++ 1990s
Wrong. +++$+++ 1980s
You pack a gun? +++$+++ 1990s
Why can't you be nice to me? +++$+++ 2000s
WILL YOU PLEASE... please listen to me ...  You know none of this is true -                           PARRY the Grail, the voices...                           Jack... There's a part of you that                         Come on...what are knows this isn't true.                             saying... I know who you are...                              I know who you are.. or who you were.                                   You're acting really- You don't belong on the                            No, no, no, no... streets. You're intelligent                        Jack... man....you're a teacher...                         Jacck!... You were a teach at Hunter College. Don't you remember?... +++$+++ 1990s
What'd you give for that thing? +++$+++ 2000s
I'm the coach! +++$+++ 1970s
Based on what my client would have earned over the next three years, including benefits and projected raises, and the extraordinary cost of medical care for someone with Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome... We would settle today for the very fair amount of one million five hundred thousand dollars. +++$+++ 1990s
No. +++$+++ 1960s
Yes. +++$+++ 1990s
Meet Col -- +++$+++ 1990s
I'm afraid to let you think, Junior. Things get worse when you think.  Oh, that's gonna help. +++$+++ 2000s
Of course not ... +++$+++ 1970s
You -- you -- +++$+++ 1940s
You don't think of me that way, do you? +++$+++ 1990s
Are you talking to me! +++$+++ 1930s
I designed it myself.  What'll it be... a face job or a full-body job? +++$+++ 1970s
You're fucking me. +++$+++ 1990s
Don't rub it in. +++$+++ 1930s
Try to think what it was. +++$+++ 1980s
Hey, no kidding?  In color? +++$+++ 1990s
No! Sit down now. +++$+++ 2000s
It doesn't take this. +++$+++ 1990s
Somethin' mighty fishy about this trail, Uncle Ethan... +++$+++ 1950s
Goddamn! +++$+++ 1990s
Who is it? +++$+++ 1970s
Five months. I love it. +++$+++ 2000s
You're surrendering. +++$+++ 2000s
Yes -- +++$+++ 1930s
You're a family man, Frankie? +++$+++ 2000s
The dockhand guy. Hanging by his neck from up there. +++$+++ 1990s
Oh. +++$+++ 1970s
Well, we're not discussing Rachel's age either. +++$+++ 1990s
I kiss you on the brain in the shadow of a train. I kiss you all starryeyed, my body's swinging from side to side. I don't see what anyone can see, in anyone else but you. +++$+++ 2000s
I told you, try to stay calm.  You're supposed to be the psychologist of the bunch. +++$+++ 2000s
Yes, I was in the war. +++$+++ 1930s
...Figured I'd better leave before I used it on him. I don't know how you can stand him. +++$+++ 1980s
Oh, no, really, I -- +++$+++ 1990s
Yes. +++$+++ 1960s
You can't tell your parents. +++$+++ 2000s
No -- what? +++$+++ 1940s
--listen, I love this country, you think I want to bring it down?--I'm not some goddamn zany, I was a hawk-- +++$+++ 1970s
Asshole!? I'm not the rope-totin' Charlie Bronson wanna-be that's getting' us lost! +++$+++ 1990s
It could be parasites, an infection... +++$+++ 1990s
That won't be necessary.  Sooner or later I knew you'd crack this thing, Max.  You got me. +++$+++ 2010s
None of the ID photos match the enhancement. +++$+++ 1990s
Yeah, they got a convention for everything. At least he was clean.  Boy, the guys I met when I was with the service, you wouldn't believe.  The older ones, they were okay.  Nice.  Polite.  Pulled the chair out for you.  But the younger ones ...  Mama used to say, dance with a man once, but if you can feel calluses on his fingers, don't dance with him again.  She thought she had it all figured out. But she wasn't so smart.  There are killers with palms like a baby. +++$+++ 1980s
Oh, don't go. +++$+++ 1930s
How many in your family? +++$+++ 2000s
Here's your check, my boy.  Thank you. +++$+++ 1980s
I am? I mean why? +++$+++ 1970s
The name's Rico, at my own father's grave, a man deserves some respect. +++$+++ 1960s
Very good.  You ought to have that printed up on your business card. +++$+++ 1990s
I will not approve it. +++$+++ 1990s
'82. +++$+++ 1990s
-- Skip. Knowing what you do about me -- +++$+++ 1990s
I wonder if he's some kind of mutant.  That bear had to be surprised. +++$+++ 1990s
And why would she do that? +++$+++ 1990s
Is she alright? +++$+++ 2000s
I think you do, yes. +++$+++ 1990s
Which floor? +++$+++ 1990s
Wait. I have Mr. Grocer for you. +++$+++ 1990s
I can’t stay here. +++$+++ 1990s
Thanks. +++$+++ 1990s
They're back! +++$+++ 1960s
What's it like where I'm going? +++$+++ 1990s
I don't believe you. +++$+++ 1960s
At least our obituaries will be accurate.  That's reassuring. +++$+++ 1990s
So.  Where have you been staying for the last week? +++$+++ 2000s
It was just a little going-away gesture. +++$+++ 2000s
I need the money. +++$+++ 1990s
Just five or six people. +++$+++ 1970s
I'll get us out of here. I really will. But if we don't play along we could alter their whole existence. We may never get home. +++$+++ 1990s
Most natural thing in the world! +++$+++ 1930s
I stay in my own yard. +++$+++ 1940s
I have my reasons. +++$+++ 1990s
This is the police, ma'am. +++$+++ 1990s
What is it?  What's the matter? +++$+++ 1970s
Two. +++$+++ 1990s
Why don’t you let me take this one, Kenny? +++$+++ 2000s
If I could get to the bridge I could send the distress signal. +++$+++ 1990s
So some people need different kinds of "convincing" than others....  Hey, just sign the petition! +++$+++ 1980s
How come her to keep bein' girlfriends and all with him if he's mean to her? +++$+++ 1990s
Certainly, sir. +++$+++ 1990s
Sit down and eat--you'll be late. +++$+++ 1950s
Wait!  I've waited seven years already!  How much longer do you want me to wait? +++$+++ 1990s
I thought you told me you didn't know where she was. +++$+++ 1940s
Why are you here? Why didn't you die? +++$+++ 2000s
Music, of course. To get a sweetheart, one has to look around, but to get a radio, all you have to do is buy one. +++$+++ 1960s
No. But it's weird. She seemed to recognize me. +++$+++ 2000s
He said he'll pick it up in a couple of days. +++$+++ 1990s
Wouldn't you like to meet him? +++$+++ 2000s
Hey...  I can't control it.  It's just, something that happened. +++$+++ 1990s
Do you know how to change a tire? +++$+++ 1990s
I swear to God. Sometimes he barks. I can hear him straight off my arm. Ruff, ruff, he goes. +++$+++ 1990s
But there is another entrance to this place. +++$+++ 1980s
I've pulled out my - uh wooden shoe and Starfleet is screaming for us to return to port. +++$+++ 1990s
Look, honey. We run the pipes through here, and we connect with the main water line here. +++$+++ 1930s
Mister Worf... find Data if you can, but your top priority is isolating the Borg. +++$+++ 1990s
Let's see how much he wants to play. +++$+++ 1990s
Physically, it's not a very demanding job.  The only thing that can get a bit trying up here during the winter is eh... the tremendous sense of isolation. +++$+++ 1980s
The Church is a fucking racket. I know how they operate. I've been part of the racket since the first time some faggot priest spilt water on my head. My Aunt Lu says I was crying all the way through. Yeah, I know their game inside out. Now I'm free of it and I'm gonna stay that way. +++$+++ 1990s
'We will remove the iron stove -- the one that was camouflaging the trap door.' +++$+++ 1950s
Greer's gone. He broke out of the tank. +++$+++ 2000s
I don't know, Grady. I just dropped him on a corner. +++$+++ 2000s
And after that we'll play the Abduction and cruel rape of Lucretia ... And I'll play Lucretia. +++$+++ 1960s
A son is a poor substitute for a lover. +++$+++ 1960s
Hey, Terry, guess who's here... that joker from the Commission... . +++$+++ 1950s
It's called Murderland. It's paid for by First Bank. +++$+++ 2000s
You're not going unless your sister goes.  End of story. +++$+++ 1990s
Me, I'm riding along, minding my own business. Four cowboys come by and we decide to ride together for a while, friendly as can be. I always figure you might as well approach life like everybody's your friend or nobody is... don't make much difference. We get out in the middle of that frying pan and suddenly everybody's pointing their gun but me. I guess they admired my horse. She's a great one, a sweet little bay. +++$+++ 1980s
Oh yeah - sure... okay. +++$+++ 1990s
I told you to lock the door. +++$+++ 1990s
Brains aren't everything. +++$+++ 1950s
They send us because they want us to change, or grow up or something and then they try to keep us the same. +++$+++ 1990s
Do you believe me? +++$+++ 1990s
... It's a comfortable place. +++$+++ 1980s
Nicole Labetzki.  Victim seven. Forensics found dog hair in her car, but they had a K-9 unit at the scene and never had it checked. +++$+++ 2000s
Yes, sir. +++$+++ 2000s
These are whipped body creams. It's like a lotion. +++$+++ 2000s
Neighbor, I'd feel better about the damned inconvenience if you'd let me buy you a drink. +++$+++ 1990s
The Champion is smiling and toying with the man -- trying to give the fans their money's worth and make a show of it with the badly out-classes challenger -- Another left to right combination. I feel sorry for -- +++$+++ 1970s
Little nervous. Wanna puke. +++$+++ 2000s
I put them in your hamper.  I thought they were dirty. +++$+++ 1980s
...that's true. Sometimes they change, sometimes they don't. Now, I remember back to when you were disbarred... +++$+++ 1980s
Nothing to speak of. What is this--third degree? +++$+++ 1930s
What do you want? +++$+++ 1930s
Because I want you to tell me. +++$+++ 1980s
Takes diamonds to stay on this list. +++$+++ 1990s
Her name is Annie.  Annie Reed. +++$+++ 1990s
What's that, a ship? +++$+++ 1970s
You're listening to a chorus of angels. The music surrounds you like a... warm and, comfortable pool of water. And while you're sleeping, you're going to be able to recall, all the things that we want you to remember. And when I count to three and clap my hands, you'll no longer be hypnotised. Can you hear me. +++$+++ 1980s
Don't even bother, X man, I'm not your type. +++$+++ 2000s
But how long is a day? +++$+++ 2000s
Now, snap out of it, fella! +++$+++ 1960s
That's real good. You ort not to if ye ain't married to somebody. Bible tells you that much. Hit tells some things that don't seem right too, I reckon. I guess a feller ort to foller it close as he can, though.  You don't touch yourself, do you? +++$+++ 1990s
Didn't it have nothin' to do with me? +++$+++ 1980s
Good evening ... Can we pass? +++$+++ 1960s
Right. +++$+++ 1990s
Why didn't you tell me? +++$+++ 2000s
No. +++$+++ 1980s
My God. I haven't seen you since... +++$+++ 1990s
If he were alive he'd have contacted me. +++$+++ 1990s
I don't care.  I see us as tiny parts of a vast organism, like two bacteria living on a rotting speck of dust floating in an infinite void. +++$+++ 1980s
Okay.  What's up? +++$+++ 2000s
Oh, be real! Would you... Would you please hug me?  I just went through a very traumatic experience and I haven't been having the best day so far. Now come on. +++$+++ 1990s
But you don't have any symptoms! +++$+++ 1980s
Oh. I mean, good. +++$+++ 1980s
Yes. +++$+++ 1990s
It just happened. +++$+++ 2000s
Nobody's gonna kill you. +++$+++ 1980s
They didn't seem too good. +++$+++ 1960s
Mr. Warne? +++$+++ 1930s
It seems to me that walking, for most people, is not very dangerous. +++$+++ 1950s
Huh? Oh, no. +++$+++ 1980s
You're correct.  I'm concerned these students are being funded by foreign interests, whether they know it or not.  The FBI is worthless in this area.  I want your full concentration on this matter ... +++$+++ 1990s
Twelve gauge. You need shells? Moss looks the gun over. +++$+++ 2000s
It's gonna blow this place out. It's gonna ruin it ... +++$+++ 1970s
Sir. I was going Mach point one five. +++$+++ 1980s
Well, I guess it's 'cause he loves you so much. He's jealous and worried. +++$+++ 1990s
I am not at the school anymore. I left last night. +++$+++ 1940s
You're a strange bird. No wonder Gainsford calls you the man who always wanted to see what was on the other side of the hill. +++$+++ 1930s
But what brought you to Sicily? +++$+++ 1980s
Terrific.  I now have a hundred dollar dry cleaning bill. +++$+++ 1990s
I tell you what's cooking.  She made the blind see and it was a gift!  Who was it from?  Let's hear an 'F" for... +++$+++ 1980s
Great to get away, take it easy. Next week, I'll get back to work. +++$+++ 1990s
The guy <u>I</u> see is in the eighth grade at <u>Prep</u> School, and he laughs his <u>ass</u> off every time we talk about you. +++$+++ 1990s
Where? +++$+++ 1980s
I won't let that happen. +++$+++ 2000s
NO, but I will lock you in. +++$+++ 2000s
What? +++$+++ 1990s
Please, have a seat. +++$+++ 2000s
Burbage has my keeping but you have my heart. +++$+++ 1990s
So do I. +++$+++ 1950s
He -- he said if I didn't give the money, he'll kill me. +++$+++ 1960s
It's what we'll find there worries me. +++$+++ 1980s
Forget it. +++$+++ 1990s
Maybe you shoulda killed him. +++$+++ 1940s
Well, why not a little of the King? +++$+++ 2000s
What are we going to do with him? +++$+++ 1950s
So I've been told. +++$+++ 1990s
Oh, gosh. +++$+++ 1980s
No wire. +++$+++ 1990s
I didn't touch him, he just passed out. +++$+++ 1990s
So what am I supposed to do? +++$+++ 2000s
Oh, will you help me?  Can you help me? +++$+++ 1930s
I know I did. +++$+++ 2000s
Constantly. +++$+++ 1980s
I like what you've done with it. When's Captain Nemo moving in? +++$+++ 2000s
Fine. +++$+++ 1970s
Then I can wear men's clothing. +++$+++ 2000s
You can do it. +++$+++ 1990s
What? +++$+++ 1990s
The name's Plissken. +++$+++ 1990s
This should be it... +++$+++ 1980s
They're driving me nuts! +++$+++ 1990s
We just saved a little baby boy. Think of it that way. +++$+++ 1990s
The same place.  One o'clock.  I have to go now.  See you tomorrow.  Remember, I need you. +++$+++ 1990s
Why not?! +++$+++ 1990s
Uhura. Can't you augment? +++$+++ 1980s
You're being unfair. +++$+++ 2000s
Well, these... women friends of yours... all over the world. How does it work? Do you see some of them again? Do you forget others? Do you write them now and then? How do you manage it? +++$+++ 1990s
Ms. Grey -- you work at a school for mutants in Westchester, New York.  Can you tell the members of this committee what exactly you are teaching these mutants? +++$+++ 2000s
Get a phone number for the Smiths. +++$+++ 2000s
Don't wanna miss this. +++$+++ 2000s
Walter, you can't do that! +++$+++ 1940s
Turn that fucking radio off! +++$+++ 2000s
Look again for fuck sake! +++$+++ 1990s
No, it doesn't. You'll see... you get totally sick of all the creeps and losers and weirdos. +++$+++ 2000s
C'mon.  I bought 'em for you, to make up for that night. +++$+++ 2000s
Unlisted age, plus "youthful mind," equals old. +++$+++ 1990s
What's your father do? +++$+++ 1970s
In his mind, anyway, and soon enough in hers.  She had written him many letters of love. +++$+++ 1990s
That's not why I'm attacking him! You don't believe me - all this time you never believed me. +++$+++ 1990s
I know you can't stand me to say I'm fat.  Like I can't stand you being a bank robber.  I guess that's what love is -- huh, Sonny? +++$+++ 1970s
Relax our center... It's just sitting in a bucket. +++$+++ 1990s
No, no.  I on holiday. +++$+++ 1990s
I'm so sorry, Stu. I <u>wanted</u> to tell you what was going on. I really, really liked you. +++$+++ 2000s
My - name - isn't - Bright Eyes It's Taylor! +++$+++ 2000s
Pleased to meet you ... Hi, bow's it going? Pleased to meet you! Hi, Carl Denham ... How's it going? +++$+++ 2000s
No. +++$+++ 1990s
And we can charge anything we want!  Two thousand a day, ten thousand a day - - people will pay it!  And then there's the merchandising - - +++$+++ 1990s
Hi. +++$+++ 1990s
Fuckin' A. +++$+++ 1990s
Cause the Russian production company would be easier to find. +++$+++ 1990s
Could be anything... Men in isolation... some beef that snowballed... got out of hand... +++$+++ 1980s
I don't know exactly. +++$+++ 1980s
What's that? +++$+++ 1980s
"... wait for help."  Wait for help. I'm not opening a door that specifically warns me not to. +++$+++ 1990s
He's been altering the coordinates since we logged on. He's a step ahead. Let's jump to #12. +++$+++ 2000s
I don't know. +++$+++ 1940s
Well, it was good to see you, Daniel, but I have to be going. +++$+++ 1990s
I'm on the run! +++$+++ 2000s
Oh no... this is a battle of nerves between John and me. +++$+++ 1960s
Put it through TACS. Smith, you up for a flyby? +++$+++ 1990s
Is that what you want me to be? +++$+++ 1950s
You're not so bad yourself. +++$+++ 2000s
What are you going to do now, Tom? +++$+++ 1990s
But, Al, it's the bunk! Norville showed me his design for the whatsit the day I met him! Why Buzz couldn't have invented it -- look at the man -- he's an imbecile! +++$+++ 1990s
Peter, I believe your baptism was perverted.  Look at your certificate. Your mother was the only witness to it. Your blood-type doesn't match who you thought your father was.  Peter...I'm sorry. +++$+++ 2000s
Thanks. +++$+++ 1980s
Don't worry about it. +++$+++ 1970s
If I gave you the impression I hated him I didn't mean to.  I... I hate the way he <u>behaves</u>... he's selfish and self-centered and cynical... +++$+++ 1990s
All that money... I mean... did you...? +++$+++ 1990s
No. But that's not the only reason people get together or..stay together. +++$+++ 1990s
No you won't.  You'll be back today. Now!  You get your ass back here, Thelma, now, Goddamnit.  Thelma, do you understand me? +++$+++ 1990s
Sex murder: three. He likes to bite. Six bad ones in Mrs. Leeds.  Eight in Mrs. Jacobi...  ...that's all I have. +++$+++ 1980s
Toxic dumps, huh. +++$+++ 2000s
No one can take my father's place. +++$+++ 1940s
Does he do this all the time? +++$+++ 2000s
'Night, Jim. +++$+++ 1970s
Lemme tell you something.  Vincent and a few other guys like him are fucking ghosts.  Nobody even know what he looked like until now... +++$+++ 2000s
Gimme a week and four guys from litigation and I'll have the Post pleading with us not to sue for libel. +++$+++ 1990s
If I owe, I will go. +++$+++ 2000s
We got to make another copy of this. Little life insurance. +++$+++ 1990s
You said it popped out too easily. Nothing's ever good enough for you, is it? +++$+++ 1990s
Decent? Why Miss Schuyler, I want to be noble. +++$+++ 1930s
I don't think 'fan mail' fits this letter.  Read it, Clark. +++$+++ 1980s
Now there's a woman who totally abuses the privilege of motherhood. +++$+++ 1990s
I never said he was faking! I never said that! +++$+++ 2000s
In Manhattan? +++$+++ 1990s
I know. +++$+++ 1990s
No treasure maps, huh? +++$+++ 1990s
Maybe, if it's a real mourning ring like we have in Jamaica. All you got to do is turn it on your finger, close your eyes, and make a wish. +++$+++ 1940s
Your men! All my life "your men" have been able to count on you? Why is it that you've never been there for me? +++$+++ 1980s
I see. +++$+++ 1990s
Why not? Because of his gibberish about GOd and the Soul? Camouflage -- that's all it is -- to blind the gullible like you! And to hide his real identity -- a fanatic whose only purpose is to kill Benes! And you made it possible! +++$+++ 1960s
I like to sail, believe me, I love to sail! Instead I make boats and other people sail them. +++$+++ 1990s
I didn't ask him that. He's lying. +++$+++ 2000s
I'm a human being, I've got some! +++$+++ 1950s
Yeah, from one side of the harbor to the other. But we got half the Bering Sea and the whole Alaskan gulf to drag her over. +++$+++ 2000s
Nothing - if she dosen't love me - +++$+++ 1940s
Driving their cars into trees... puking on the sidewalk... stupid shit! +++$+++ 2000s
I don't think I'll be running into him. +++$+++ 2000s
Twenty bucks says not here she don't find one. +++$+++ 1990s
Two o'clock. +++$+++ 1960s
I wished to be reinstated at Computer Crimes. I was undiplomatic in my request. +++$+++ 2000s
Oh, wow. +++$+++ 1990s
...I had a great time tonight, really.  It was like the Nuremberg Trials. +++$+++ 1980s
Back where? +++$+++ 1990s
Bluebell came in? +++$+++ 1990s
The key, yeah, the key's in my pants in the bathroom. +++$+++ 1990s
I know about you. +++$+++ 1990s
Thank you. +++$+++ 1960s
I'm sure they'll notice things missing. +++$+++ 1990s
No, c'mon, Freddy, let's have this out & over. You know what everyone thinks? They think you're making a case coz you found yourself a nice piece of ass. And no one's blaming you for it, I hear she's worth the flowers. But don't come in here get- ting holy over us. Sure I put it in the paper. Coz I wanted to <u>stop</u> this bullshit. I don't want you drunk out- ta your head searching my office ag- ain. it's pissing <u>me</u>, & <u>everyone</u> off. +++$+++ 1990s
Have you seen a woman about so high? +++$+++ 1970s
You're imagining it. +++$+++ 1990s
With that cast on -- you don't. +++$+++ 1950s
What's going on? +++$+++ 1980s
Sarah, we could take off and leave this guy behind... +++$+++ 1990s
You'll meet new friends.  I know ... it's rough.  But I have to move, son. +++$+++ 1950s
I've been thinking about you a lot all these years, locked up in my cell.  I'd tear through every issue of the Midwest Science Journal looking for your latest findings, watching as you slowly worked your polymerization experiments up through single celled organisms to that holiest of holies, the fruit fly.  Exciting stuff.  I got to tell you, it really kept me going. +++$+++ 1990s
Hear what? +++$+++ 1990s
He's turning blue! +++$+++ 1990s
You bet it is ... and Luke's out in it. +++$+++ 1980s
You didn't tell your sister about Ripley, did you?  'Cause I don't wanna go through that again. +++$+++ 1990s
Wouldn't it be fabulous if we somehow stayed in love for the rest of our lives? +++$+++ 1990s
Take a look across the street. +++$+++ 1990s
Right. +++$+++ 1990s
Right away.  Will you have something, Mr. Thompson? +++$+++ 1940s
Can't we just ice them along with the rest of the citizenry? +++$+++ 1940s
Are you done with these? +++$+++ 1950s
Oh I wouldn't miss it for the world. I bet you did such a great job. +++$+++ 2000s
A little... You think it's the same for Jacques? +++$+++ 1980s
That would hardly be proper. +++$+++ 2000s
Where is he now, sir? +++$+++ 1970s
Cut the crap, X, I saw you down there. You're a hero. Don't be afraid to join the good guys. +++$+++ 2000s
Nice day, Major. +++$+++ 1930s
Ignorant.  The thing's ignorant. +++$+++ 1990s
Can I see some of the other tapes to get an idea of what -- +++$+++ 1980s
Yeah, come on in. +++$+++ 1990s
That what you want? +++$+++ 2000s
What a fine boy you have, Jabez. How old is he now? +++$+++ 2000s
What? +++$+++ 1990s
In your operation. +++$+++ 1990s
Easy, Johnny.  Now ain't the time.  I tell you, boys, even I'm Worried what'll happen once Ringo Runs this outfit!  God have mercy! +++$+++ 1990s
Go out there! Find somebody, ask some questions!  I'm sorry if I seem over-anxious to you. I keep thinking... something's wrong. I have to know what! +++$+++ 1960s
He talked to me today. Told me to keep my mouth shut or I'd get everybody in trouble. +++$+++ 1980s
Not quite. You haven't announced our engagement yet. +++$+++ 1990s
He just needs some clothes? +++$+++ 1990s
Yeah, so I noticed. Have you made up your mind? +++$+++ 1940s
No. No! No! +++$+++ 1960s
Newmeat looks like a poker player, Drag. +++$+++ 1960s
What? +++$+++ 1990s
If we don't get out of here soon we can ask him in person. +++$+++ 1990s
What's the job? +++$+++ 1950s
Way past it. +++$+++ 1980s
So many authors are denied the gratification of a concrete response to their work. I am blessed, am I not? +++$+++ 2000s
Yes, dear. You forgot all about it. +++$+++ 1950s
I never thought I'd ask this of anyone, Andy, but do me a favor and kill the evil son-of-a-bitch, will you? +++$+++ 1990s
Alright, enough, Ross. You'll bring on my "Nervous Tick" ... +++$+++ 1990s
You can't. +++$+++ 1950s
Red cross over to blue double blue ...is that what it is? A squid? +++$+++ 1990s
Patch him through.... +++$+++ 1990s
Claire... +++$+++ 2000s
According to you I'm a sexual failure. An animal, you said.  You know now, don't you? +++$+++ 1980s
Not ghosts... at least not what you're thinking... Vannacutt used to dump the bodies of his failed experiments somewhere in the house... +++$+++ 1990s
Hey! You don't need to be a scientist figure it out... +++$+++ 1990s
I'm gonna head back to the office... finish up some things. +++$+++ 1990s
Oh, Stew and I went for a long ride.  Dexter, is there any finishing school we can send him to? +++$+++ 1930s
I lost my gun after I left you today and I'm the laughing stock of a lot of people.  I wanted to tell you that. I wanted you to know...and it's on my mind and it makes me look like a fool and I feel like a fool and you asked that we should say things, that we should say what we're thinknig and not lie about things and I'll tell you that, this: that I lost my gun and I'm not a good cop...and I'm looked down at...and I know that....and I'm scared that once you find that out you might not like me. +++$+++ 1990s
I've been dealing in Earth's politics a good deal longer than you have.  Goodnight, sir. +++$+++ 2000s
Engineering... +++$+++ 1970s
You're everything a guy could want. +++$+++ 2000s
Yeah, I fixed it. Well, I ain't... um, I can't remember. I think I took it out to fit the bags and forgot to put it back. +++$+++ 2000s
I can't believe we're stealing a plane. +++$+++ 2000s
Miami? +++$+++ 1990s
Bastaldi got the address from you, yes? +++$+++ 2000s
Do we have to invite him to the wedding? +++$+++ 1990s
Maybe somebody felt that four shares were too many -- +++$+++ 1960s
I think it's the most exciting --  We're going to see things no one ever saw before. The actual physical process of Life itself -- not something under a microscope... Just think of it -- +++$+++ 1960s
Dad! +++$+++ 1980s
Yes! +++$+++ 2000s
Where's the collar, in the cells? +++$+++ 2000s
Do I know you? +++$+++ 2000s
He could see me. +++$+++ 2000s
Billy had alibis too. +++$+++ 1990s
Hi, boys, we almost gave up on you. +++$+++ 1990s
Does she have a cell phone?  A way we can contact her? +++$+++ 2000s
Why not? +++$+++ 1990s
And how many people did you cut up with the couple of with it? Or hundred knives you've probably owned in your lifetime? +++$+++ 1950s
Very well. I suppose I could make out my weekly report to Starfleet Command without your input.  "Admiral Lusby, regarding the unusual behavior of Jean-Luc Picard: I find him increasingly irritable, remote and uncooperative. I recommend forced shore leave at a Starbase facility in order to-" +++$+++ 1990s
He died -- about five or six years ago. +++$+++ 1990s
The deadly nightshade you slipped me wore off, Sally... I thought I'd find you here.... +++$+++ 1990s
Blocked at every turn.  Beautifully synchronized, don't you agree? +++$+++ 1990s
Hey Chief. Bring my cup back. +++$+++ 1970s
Have you broken it yet?  We've got six more heads and that means six more hours. +++$+++ 2000s
Then what goes on in there?  What I mean is, what are you thinking about? +++$+++ 1990s
Question is, what are you doing here? +++$+++ 2000s
Miss Caswell?  What? +++$+++ 1950s
Don't thank me, Dr. Johnson.  You weren't my choice.  The Pentagon made me take you. +++$+++ 1990s
You want to skip fourth period and go to the Ridge? +++$+++ 2000s
Yes. The famous James Bond. I've heard all about you, sir. You were under direct orders to act as an observer - and yet you had to go off, on your own, like some half-assed CIA cowboy -  Endangering the gold, attracting that lunatic woman, and then putting in a distress call for us to save your bloody hide. +++$+++ 1990s
It's Cochrane. +++$+++ 1990s
A rare pleasure to meet you, ma'am! Where I come from --out in Montana--we have some pretty women, but I guess if you walked down Main Street they'd turn out the fire brigade. +++$+++ 1930s
Can you get us a line? +++$+++ 1970s
Listen, Baxter, we made you and we can break you. +++$+++ 1960s
Do I look like I need your money.  It doesn’t work like that and I can’t tell you why. +++$+++ 2000s
Such power exists? +++$+++ 2000s
What makes you say that? +++$+++ 1990s
I'm afraid I've gotten too old for this sort of thing. +++$+++ 1970s
This man belongs in hospital. +++$+++ 1980s
"The dark inside..."? I don't understand. +++$+++ 1990s
Christ, I don't believe this! +++$+++ 1990s
I'm gonna rip you up bitch. Just like your slut whore mother. +++$+++ 1990s
You wouldn't even see it move. +++$+++ 1990s
What do you want? +++$+++ 1990s
Yeah, all right... +++$+++ 1990s
Well, you did and she's fine. Thanks. +++$+++ 1970s
He took care of Charlie for us. +++$+++ 1960s
As much as possible. +++$+++ 1970s
No, it's pronounced Aye gor. +++$+++ 1970s
Okay. Just remember that. Now beat it. +++$+++ 1930s
Wrong. Jason can't get a fair trial because of _these_. +++$+++ 2000s
I think I'd remember that. +++$+++ 1990s
Ninotchka, do you like me just a little bit? +++$+++ 1930s
WE NEVER SUSPECTED YOU! +++$+++ 1980s
Your wife, sir? Has she gone away? +++$+++ 1970s
Maybe we should start thinking about going home, huh? +++$+++ 1980s
What do you want with our scan-proof lockers? +++$+++ 1970s
I'm sorry but I have to leave. I'll find other work. You'll have to get someone else, that's all. +++$+++ 2000s
Hello.... oh, just a minute.  Police department? +++$+++ 1930s
Hard to compare the people you're taking down with the Lord. +++$+++ 2000s
Just now... +++$+++ 1970s
You ain't like that no more. +++$+++ 1990s
Johnny, wait... +++$+++ 1990s
Yes it was all you -- +++$+++ 2000s
Mr. Spicoli, you're on dangerous ground here. You're causing a major disturbance in my class and on my time. +++$+++ 1980s
You took a cab to see three kung fu movies? +++$+++ 1990s
Salute. +++$+++ 1990s
I'm pissing you off? I'm doing what I said I'd do. What the hell are you doing? What about your word? +++$+++ 1990s
Who came up with the Monster's makeup and look? +++$+++ 1990s
Well, I can't imagine five years of unemployment -- +++$+++ 1990s
I know. +++$+++ 2000s
Good morning, my lord! +++$+++ 1990s
Certainly, Mr. Jones! Certainly! Charlie! +++$+++ 1930s
-- unless Frank is specifically ommitted as a beneficiary that's what will happen. +++$+++ 1990s
No, I'm sorry, for pushing you out. +++$+++ 2000s
No, of course not. It's only that he called last night and asked if I could come by. +++$+++ 1970s
You should have stayed in bed this morning. +++$+++ 1960s
Thank you, sir. I've looked forward to this for a long time. +++$+++ 1980s
I think anti-semitism today is largely a Jewish phenomenon. Wouldn't you agree? +++$+++ 2000s
Don't go to any trouble.  We believe you... We believe you. +++$+++ 1980s
You going to Knott's Berry Farm with him? +++$+++ 1970s
I can explain it.  Attempted murder wasn't enough for him.  He wants to add kidnapping to the charges. +++$+++ 1990s
Don't have one, Carl. I have a number, man. Just like the numbers on those treasury checks. You stole from your own country, Carl. Shame on you. +++$+++ 1990s
I don't have it. That's why Vincent went to Chicago. They arrested him before he could bring it back. +++$+++ 2000s
I'm sorry!  I said something wrong, didn't I!  Please forgive me! +++$+++ 1990s
Yes ... yes, but I'm not sure what I saw anymore. +++$+++ 1950s
Don't worry! +++$+++ 1980s
Our relationship's moving fast, I know, but I have real, real respect for you. +++$+++ 1980s
Not a clue. +++$+++ 1990s
I love you, Adam. +++$+++ 1960s
Look, I'm rock climbing Sunday. How about coming along? +++$+++ 1990s
Still am.  There's more gold than I thought, and since there's only two of us now...  Where should I go? +++$+++ 1990s
Cute.  He was inside for about 20 minutes.  The other guy, Roach, waited in the truck.  They were scoping it out, right?! +++$+++ 1990s
I'll take some lessons this time. I promise. +++$+++ 1980s
Enjoyed it? +++$+++ 1970s
Would he know? +++$+++ 1960s
We both lied to him. +++$+++ 2000s
What deviant groups or organizations did he secretly belong to?  What is it, Bob?! +++$+++ 1990s
Okay. +++$+++ 1990s
Yes, My Lord.  We'll find them. +++$+++ 1980s
Oh, no reason, you keep me prisoner, you make me burn my book, you drive a sledgehammer into my ankles... +++$+++ 1990s
Okay, Willard, sit down. +++$+++ 1970s
You will, eh? Well, we'll see about that.  All right, boys. Take it. +++$+++ 1940s
Says me. I've been here for half an hour. I'd call that first dibs. +++$+++ 1990s
I know -- but she wants you to represent her if Cardenas files. +++$+++ 1990s
What're you talkin' about? +++$+++ 1990s
So? +++$+++ 1990s
No way. +++$+++ 1990s
You don't think I'm going to let this blackmailer intimidate me, do you? +++$+++ 1940s
Maybe we should soap your hand or something. +++$+++ 1990s
Well, you should. +++$+++ 1980s
Thanks very much.  Care for some suchi?. +++$+++ 1980s
So it's six hundred feet below Park Avenue, It's still a Park Avenue address. +++$+++ 1970s
If old pictures interest you, come back some time, there's quite a collection down in the pagoda.  I'll see you get a proper tour. +++$+++ 1990s
What's this about not eating? +++$+++ 1930s
I hope we all get to do many things. Can we go now? +++$+++ 2000s
If there is, develop it! +++$+++ 1970s
Just gimme a chance. +++$+++ 1970s
Tell us the truth.  You don't just find these things, at least not in this neighborhood. +++$+++ 1990s
I want the girl.  Unharmed.  Now. +++$+++ 1990s
I'm walking towards the elevator's, Janet. +++$+++ 1990s
She's only known the guy a few months. +++$+++ 2000s
This one's got you working overtime, hasn't it? +++$+++ 1990s
...sorry, Molly. I'm sorry this happened to you. +++$+++ 1980s
Three days. +++$+++ 1990s
I appreciate the welcome; I wish the circumstances were less critical.  Epsilon Nine is monitoring the intruder; keep a channel open to them.  Where is Captain Decker? +++$+++ 1970s
No! Not again! +++$+++ 1980s
Shall I leave? +++$+++ 1990s
I know, I know. +++$+++ 2000s
Listen to me, Sal. If you don't do it they'll put you in the pit. If they put you in the pit, Sal, you're gonna die... Sal, do you understand? +++$+++ 1970s
Let the record show I'm just standing here. +++$+++ 1990s
Good.  Your old man's all right, he just saved your life. +++$+++ 1990s
What's wrong, Nathan? +++$+++ 1970s
You think this'll work? +++$+++ 1990s
God ... this can't be true. +++$+++ 1990s
You doubt me? +++$+++ 1980s
A pianist. +++$+++ 2000s
When can I have one? +++$+++ 1970s
You are ready, then? +++$+++ 1980s
What's wrong? +++$+++ 2000s
You have changed since second grade. +++$+++ 2000s
Stay away from me! Dad! Dad! +++$+++ 2000s
That's what the newspapers say. Weren't for Jesse James, this gang wouldn't be able to find a goat's ass with a stick. +++$+++ 2000s
Pleased to meet you, sir. +++$+++ 1930s
Okay, we'll split up.  You go to every romantic place you guys have, I'll go... someplace brilliant, and the first one who... +++$+++ 1990s
You guys are so sweet! +++$+++ 2000s
No. +++$+++ 2000s
We'll see that she gets there in good time +++$+++ 1940s
I know someone else who's sensitive. +++$+++ 1980s
Before I met your maw, God rest her soul, it used to be I was kinda... wicked... drinkin' spirits an' gettin' into scrapes an' all. Only she made me see the error of my ways an'... I ain't like I was no more. +++$+++ 1990s
Mac.  What's shaking? +++$+++ 1990s
I have no illusions about the future. What is, is. We make choices. And we become the sum total of our choices. I can live with that. +++$+++ 1990s
Start the car. +++$+++ 1990s
Can I tell you kids something? +++$+++ 1980s
I'm not interested in your book. I'm talking about the Building and Loan. +++$+++ 1940s
You'd know better'n me. +++$+++ 2000s
What the hell do you think it was about?  There's nothing an unproved heir to the throne likes less than glaring competence in others. +++$+++ 2000s
Shit!  Oh, shit. +++$+++ 1990s
I don't know what you mean, sir. +++$+++ 1970s
Hundred and eight ain't a hundred and thirteen. +++$+++ 1970s
I wish there was some way I could... just... pay the fine and go home. +++$+++ 1990s
This is a great house, really. Everything. Saunas, Jacuzzis, three tennis courts. You know who the original owners were? Nelson Eddy, then Legs Diamond. Then you know who lived here? +++$+++ 1970s
Who are you? +++$+++ 2000s
What do you wish me to do? +++$+++ 1970s
I don't know why I feel so good. I haven't felt this good in a long time. +++$+++ 1980s
Dad's disappeared! +++$+++ 2000s
General Schmuck, are you positive of your figures? +++$+++ 1960s
He using her. +++$+++ 1990s
Did you get her name? +++$+++ 1980s
Oh no!  Wear a coat of cotton--wear a coat of wool. +++$+++ 1970s
Plans for absorbing the Tibetan army into the People's Army will soon be finalized. +++$+++ 1990s
Could this be a trap? +++$+++ 1980s
The day I show respect to Biff Tannen will be the day I win a million dollars... What's the matter, Biff, they're not showing you any respect down at the golf course? Don't they realize what a tough job it is keeping the criminal element away from the country club? +++$+++ 1980s
They're going to walk right past me. +++$+++ 2000s
I got caught robbing a synagogue. Lots of good stuff in them holy places; churches, temples, mosques, and who's guarding them? +++$+++ 1990s
Oh Yeah? What's your master plan here? +++$+++ 1990s
Dealing +++$+++ 1970s
Goddamnit!  What am I doing?  What's happened to all my cigars?  Colonel Richards here has had a dozen agents on these cases for over a year.  No arrests, no leads, no clues... +++$+++ 1990s
Well, I kinda just blurted it out over a root beer float. +++$+++ 1990s
I wish I had my board with me now. Even if I could only polish it once in awhile. +++$+++ 1970s
Who's this fat man, then? +++$+++ 1990s
Don't have Weather Channel in the Mountain, Nick. +++$+++ 2000s
Baaaa! Fuck it, they sold us out - so what! What'd you'all expect? Civilian life is phoney BULLSHIT man. They're ROBOTS man - watchin' dopey television and drivin' dopey cars, and they fuck up, nobody dies. That's all right, you keep fuckin' up, politicians keep lyin'. Cause it don't really matter. Don't mean shit. So what! Whatcha want - a parade! Fuck that too! No war time no grunt never got no respect. Till he was dead - and even THEN! You're fighting for YOURSELF man! You're fighting for your SOUL, dat's all. Remember dat. And it's some goddamn battle too - if you'se a man, wrestle with that angel...  ...Love and Hate - the whole shitbang show, that's the story then and now and it ain't hardly gonna change... +++$+++ 1980s
... idiot! Open the damn door! Go, go, go, come on! +++$+++ 1990s
Can you cover me for an hour? +++$+++ 1990s
I know what you're like .. +++$+++ 1990s
This is sweet!! +++$+++ 1990s
It takes about twenty to twenty-two hours for the current to reach here from Lisca Bianca. +++$+++ 1960s
-- please, please forgive me... +++$+++ 1970s
No, no.  I'm fine.  What did the Speaker say? +++$+++ 1990s
Okay, sweetheart. Have a lovely Birthday Party tomorrow. +++$+++ 1960s
Don't let them take me, Steve -- +++$+++ 1980s
You know what I mean.  I saw a lot of strange things going on in this office this summer.  And a lotta strange people. +++$+++ 1990s
She <u>is</u>--she's helped solve a bunch of murders: Arizona, New Mexico-- +++$+++ 2000s
No! I can't explain now. Oh, look -- the pearls. You wear them now... +++$+++ 1930s
Yeah. +++$+++ 1970s
Don't. +++$+++ 1970s
It was a hard assignment, that's why you got it. +++$+++ 1990s
Alive. +++$+++ 1960s
I don't know. +++$+++ 1990s
And they took that away. +++$+++ 2000s
O-o-oh, I get you—  All right. All right. I don't blame you. I kinda forgot myself for a moment, there. That's what I call getting me told, isn't it, Anne? +++$+++ 1930s
Oh, Biff. You can "pin" me any time you want to. +++$+++ 1990s
If I had a nickel for every one of Alan's flyboy buddies who tried to pick me up, I'd be a rich woman. +++$+++ 1980s
I thought Steve had talked to you? +++$+++ 1980s
Oh come off it, Mare. What about what's-his-name... Steverino? You could've at least passed the baton on that one. +++$+++ 1990s
What? +++$+++ 2000s
Ah. +++$+++ 2000s
The nightcrawler.  The bloodsucker. +++$+++ 1980s
Sure, Pete Clemenza died of a heart attack, but the Rosato Brothers gave it to him. +++$+++ 1970s
What?  What movie? +++$+++ 2000s
I don't know. He must have had some purpose in taking the plane away from Fenner.  When he lands, we'll find out. +++$+++ 1930s
Your Majesty -- +++$+++ 1990s
I got some hair stuff. +++$+++ 2000s
What I'm trying to say, Mitch, is these things happen sometimes, you know? Ain't much we can do about it. +++$+++ 1960s
Dead. +++$+++ 1980s
I never saw anything like it. How did she pick him up so fast? +++$+++ 1990s
Annette, just use your hand. +++$+++ 1990s
Only the mention made in that phone call. There's no Swedish hitman of any renown, much less one with a million dollar day rate. +++$+++ 2000s
It's dead. +++$+++ 1930s
This fence...it's so... +++$+++ 2000s
What about Ricky? He'd jump at the opportunity. +++$+++ 2000s
Good. Gibby gave me champagne. +++$+++ 1990s
Is Krupchek an aggressive guy?  Hot- tempered?  Anything like that? +++$+++ 2000s
What, like it's that hard? +++$+++ 2000s
Didn't Mr. Marsh also tell you that Miss Lawson felt bored here and was thinking about going back to Chicago for awhile? +++$+++ 1990s
So, if I win it's because deep down you know you're about to make the biggest mistake of your life, and deep down your want me to stop you. +++$+++ 2000s
We don't want to tire you out, dear. +++$+++ 1990s
I can die trying. +++$+++ 2000s
There ya go.  I beg your pardon? +++$+++ 1980s
Oh, a D-Girl. You know... I have a really great idea for a screenplay. +++$+++ 1980s
Not hungry. I want to get through this work in a hurry, and then I want to go home. What price did you get on those trucks? +++$+++ 1930s
Silent night, violent night... +++$+++ 1990s
Maybe it ain't coming. +++$+++ 1980s
I guess somebody beat me to it. +++$+++ 1990s
Work hard, be good at your job. Sir. Do whatever they tell you. +++$+++ 1990s
How does she like what in bed? +++$+++ 1990s
There, that's nice. I have to have my pictures when I travel. And Freddy of course.  Isn't that right, sweetie. +++$+++ 1990s
Goodbye. +++$+++ 1990s
This is a one time thing, Gusto.  One and I'm out.  Give me a good price for old time's sake.  What do you think? +++$+++ 2000s
Let us go, miss. +++$+++ 1970s
Commander, I must speak to you. It is a matter of supreme importance... We are Thermians from the Klatu Nebula, and we require your help. I beseech you to come with us, back to our ship. A great many lives hang in the balance... +++$+++ 1990s
Well I guess folks don't mind they's integrated. +++$+++ 2000s
You mean they'll replace you with someone who won't perform abortions. +++$+++ 1990s
What's his real name? +++$+++ 2000s
What are you talking about? Bateman is what? +++$+++ 2000s
No, they're all right.  I meant, you just got here. +++$+++ 1990s
Does your Mum and Dad know about Tony? +++$+++ 1980s
I hate the weird ones. +++$+++ 1980s
Unbearable, I'd imagine. +++$+++ 1990s
And video games after! +++$+++ 2000s
That doesn't tell us much. Did you run a check on the gas like I told you? +++$+++ 1990s
Well, try, huh. +++$+++ 1990s
Brian Cruikshank -- it would serve me right if I got stuck with that one. +++$+++ 1960s
Uh, this is our paleobotanist, Dr Ellie..... +++$+++ 1990s
It's possible. I don't know about that. +++$+++ 1990s
Now Betty, don't overreact. +++$+++ 1980s
Turn the light on. +++$+++ 2000s
You shouldn'ta turned the gun on that kid, man.  You shouldn'ta -- +++$+++ 1980s
We're getting married. +++$+++ 1980s
It's no use.  We'll never get away with it, Joe. +++$+++ 1950s
You showed up. Oh, my god! Holy shit! Look at this car, man! +++$+++ 1990s
Apone...where are your people? Anybody in D-Block? +++$+++ 1980s
No.  No, sir.  I loved that condo. I loved every stick of furniture. The lamps, the chairs, the rugs, were me.  The dishes were me.  The plants were... +++$+++ 1990s
Oh, no? +++$+++ 1990s
Stupid watch.  Stopped again.  Do you have the -- +++$+++ 2000s
But you were such good <i>friends...</i> +++$+++ 2000s
...and buried him. +++$+++ 1940s
That part, Nick... was planned out the day I read your letters. +++$+++ 2000s
Well don't drag your ass.  There won't be much of a window for us to link up.  We'll be in your orbit trajectory in less than two hours. +++$+++ 1990s
Yes.  Isn't it there? +++$+++ 1990s
That's good. That's uh... good. +++$+++ 2000s
I'm pretty close. But when I wrote the last contact switches, it wiped out a piece of the content filer. You know what it's like, writing software. +++$+++ 2000s
What do you want ? +++$+++ 1960s
Well, then you know what I'm talking about. Anyway, here's the story. I scored with these two chicks. True story. +++$+++ 1990s
Panther... +++$+++ 1980s
Don't get hurt. +++$+++ 2000s
Courage is an emotion too, Data.  Now, can you project the course of the ribbon? +++$+++ 1990s
Right.  They don't trust!  They don't trust America! +++$+++ 1990s
What can I tell you? +++$+++ 1990s
Do you? +++$+++ 1990s
I'm just trying to be a gentleman, show some respect... +++$+++ 1990s
Tim, what are you talking about? +++$+++ 1990s
Why are you here?  Really. +++$+++ 1990s
The ring? We'll have no more nonsense about the ring. +++$+++ 1940s
That's fine. +++$+++ 1970s
I'm not going to give you my keys. +++$+++ 1980s
Not that I know of.  Explanation? +++$+++ 1990s
You need a good review and you'll be fine.  The whole color of the world will change, mark my words. +++$+++ 2000s
Angel, Second Class. +++$+++ 1940s
No, Clarence. Just forget it, babe. I just wanna disappear from there. +++$+++ 1990s
You ... You ... I'd expect it of an Anglo, yes ... but you ... +++$+++ 1950s
It's not that cold. Here, let me wrap it. +++$+++ 2000s
Where do you want to do this? +++$+++ 1970s
No, I think it means, "Recall period Mistake," and the OPE is probably the CRM-114 code. Terry? +++$+++ 1960s
I am the oldest. +++$+++ 2000s
I wasn't singing to myself. +++$+++ 1940s
Smart for your age, eh? Top of your class? Tell me, do you know what the word &quot;propaganda&quot; means? +++$+++ 1990s
Hey.  At least it's not an editing machine. +++$+++ 1990s
Finally realized Rick's a jerk, huh? +++$+++ 1980s
This is too fast.  This is <U>way</U> too fast! +++$+++ 2000s
Won't worry about it. You go ahead. +++$+++ 1990s
This is the personnel file on the programmer, Lindenmeyer. There might be something in it you can use. +++$+++ 1990s
I want to do something <u>positive</u>... +++$+++ 2000s
I need an extra fifty.  Two patrolmen at twenty apiece and a dime for the watch commander at Hollywood Station. +++$+++ 1990s
For me they are exactly as they were when we met three days ago -- just three days ago... don't you realize? And you and Anna... No, I guess they aren't like that any more. My God, is it possible to forget in such a short time, for things to change so quickly? +++$+++ 1960s
Yes? +++$+++ 1990s
Nothing. I broke a lamp. +++$+++ 1990s
What's funny? +++$+++ 1990s
We can't do that, dude -- +++$+++ 2000s
I see the Prince of Wales is here. +++$+++ 1990s
Because -- I am. +++$+++ 1960s
Thank you. We'll all keep that in mind. 'Bye now. +++$+++ 1980s
Why? Why's anything happen? It's all money, man. Money. The girl just got in the way. +++$+++ 2000s
No, let her rest. +++$+++ 1990s
I can't get over what those guys did to her. I just can't. +++$+++ 1990s
Come on. Come swimmin' with us. +++$+++ 1990s
All right, Johnnie, you want to play it this way, I can play it this way. You want to know who made a mistake, why don't you open the case. +++$+++ 1990s
...Let me just show you. +++$+++ 1990s
So many children. Are they all orphans? +++$+++ 1990s
Look, people undress in public because, A, they're exhibitionists, B, they're nutcases, or C, they need the money. I can tell you're not A, and I hope to hell you're not B. So my suggestion is, think about why you're a C and let your body party, shake your groove thing, boogie oogie oogie till you just can't boogie no more. +++$+++ 1990s
Some, you were, you were going to make a reservation for us?  Where's my schedule? Where are we <u>booked</u> tonight? +++$+++ 2000s
A vacuum, Edmund.  That's what we have in Los Angeles.  Sending Mickey Cohen up created it.  My containment work maintained it. Certain photographs guarantee it. Organized crime has been held back, but there's still a demand for the services it provides. +++$+++ 1990s
If they're not busted now, they're gonna be.  It's wide open. +++$+++ 1990s
No -- clothes.  Stevie, they changed into them. +++$+++ 1970s
Hey, where y'at, Frank?  You're wasting your time here.  Big Jim gave strict orders.  No FBI allowed. +++$+++ 1990s
State to federal jurisdiction... We can do it - eventually - but we'll never get all the clearances in time. Can you convince him a deal's already in place? +++$+++ 1990s
No. +++$+++ 1990s
I've seen it. +++$+++ 1970s
I'm soldier of the Republic, you'll need the mahogany truncheon for this boyo. A nation once again. +++$+++ 1960s
You didn't know? But then why did you... well, don't worry. It's relatively mild. +++$+++ 1990s
Come on Buddy, you wouldn't want to got me disbarred now would you? +++$+++ 1980s
She has reason to be suspicious..Doesn't she? +++$+++ 2000s
Them po' young folks. Looks like Norville's in fo' the same kind o' heartache ol' Warin' had. But then, she never axed me 'bout dat... +++$+++ 1990s
Oh, Mark! Is this the baby's room? It's beautiful! +++$+++ 2000s
What are you spying on? +++$+++ 1990s
This is it... I wasn't sure if it even really existed. +++$+++ 1990s
Can we go now, huh? LUCY Maybe later.  Grandpa's expecting us. +++$+++ 1980s
I'm going through a period of my life where I just can't be around people.  I didn't want to wind up abusing anyone. +++$+++ 1980s
Exactly. A dance. +++$+++ 1980s
Well, then, I'll take it up with her. +++$+++ 1990s
Sit down a moment, Billy.  I'm afraid I have some bad news for you. +++$+++ 1970s
Shut up.  Are you nuts? +++$+++ 1950s
Well, I don't want to look like I know what's coming... +++$+++ 2000s
You ever see her talk to the walls? +++$+++ 1970s
'Bout the same time I busted Doucet I tried to nail this big-time dealer. I didn't have an ID, but I was close. Too close.  Gained the confidence of a badass named Dubbs.  He was going to turn me onto the big man.  He made me for a cop.  Mysteriously my fellow officers discovered ten pounds of heroin in my cruiser. +++$+++ 1990s
Mistake?  Hey, guy, get back here! +++$+++ 2000s
The young are eating the old, something that usually doesn't happen here. +++$+++ 1980s
What do you think, Josephine?  What does it say in your crystal ball? +++$+++ 1950s
There are lots of reason... I had a thought that if you had sex with Simon it might... +++$+++ 1990s
Department of Commerce. She's a secretary.  They have a man they call the Secretary, but he isn't at all. My mother's a real secretary.  Mr. Carpenter -- now can we go see the space ship? +++$+++ 2000s
This is what family is for, Ed! This is when ya come together! +++$+++ 2000s
-- there's already been way too many complications for a very simple plan. You ever find out what happened to Melissa Marr? +++$+++ 1990s
Listen everybody, I know this may sound corny, I've had a few glasses of wine and that kind of makes me a little emotional, but I'm going to say it anyway. It just came over me in a rush. I want you all to know that I care about each and every one of you at this table. +++$+++ 1990s
Objection! +++$+++ 1990s
Can't see a thing.  Are you sure? +++$+++ 1990s
The Butler did it.  Guy was a cross between Alistair Cook and a Cuisinart. Dude took Mr. Ed and humptied dumptied it over Gates's head.  He said it was made by, get this, Leonardo.. +++$+++ 1990s
You look like Robinson after that last LaMotta fight.  'Course LaMotta looked a lot worse.  So you're twenty-two, right? +++$+++ 1990s
What about? +++$+++ 1970s
Eh? +++$+++ 1990s
I'm not interested in the details. And I'm not interested in the big picture either.  What I am inter- ersted in is how my Board got conven- ed behind my back, is entertaining a further proposal from a man whom it offends me to do business with, moreover has the audacity to present this to me like a prize fish, and I am expected to clap for it like a performing seal.  No, thank you. +++$+++ 1990s
I was with Valerie, I swear. This is Adrian's work. I've got to find him. +++$+++ 2000s
...excuse me?! +++$+++ 1990s
Which is guy-speak for... +++$+++ 1990s
I really think you're +++$+++ 1990s
259-7881. +++$+++ 2000s
Have you no fear of God? +++$+++ 1990s
He tried to disconnect ROK.  It gassed him.  That computer is running this ship and we're heading right for the sun. +++$+++ 1980s
Can't. +++$+++ 1990s
Yeah, I know. +++$+++ 1980s
And you gonna live it with him? +++$+++ 2000s
I heard you opera-lovers were having a little rally - so I thought I better be around in case anybody decides to sing. +++$+++ 1950s
What is Mac out? +++$+++ 2000s
You're doomed. I'm leaving here in two hours and then they're going to come up here and beat the mortal shit out of you with big saps. Right there in that tub. +++$+++ 1990s
Thank you, Uncle. +++$+++ 1970s
But in order to do so, the church must first prove her heresy, or else you'll be burning a martyr... +++$+++ 2000s
They were simple songs. +++$+++ 1980s
Without the Mask it doesn't matter. +++$+++ 1990s
No problem. It's not as though I'm rushing off to the opera or anything. +++$+++ 1990s
As soon as you stop <u>acting</u> like one. Come on, you're <u>smarter</u> than this. You think those people out there <u>care</u> about you?  You're just a <u>fad</u> to them. +++$+++ 1990s
Naomi. +++$+++ 2000s
Get knotted. +++$+++ 2000s
I wish that was all Miss Weathers, but there's more. The killer left a note. +++$+++ 2000s
No prob: I'll just hop down the hardware store -- +++$+++ 1990s
What? +++$+++ 2000s
Go to the water, it's that way! +++$+++ 2000s
Coming about.... +++$+++ 1970s
Don't worry. +++$+++ 1980s
Doctor Nichols, I might have something to offer <u>you</u>. +++$+++ 1980s
You were attracted to me? +++$+++ 1990s
Maybe that bartender made it up. I mean I think coyotes are rather beautiful. Maybe "coyote ugly" is really a compliment. Like someone who's conventionally "ugly" but is really beautiful. +++$+++ 1980s
The quicker the better. Well -- I finally got out what I came in to tell you.  So long, Walter, and better luck next time. +++$+++ 1940s
Good boy. Good job. And you call yourself "not a doctor"!  Keep an eye on her--she's in trouble. +++$+++ 1990s
I surrender -- +++$+++ 2000s
It's a 27B/6, what did you think it was? +++$+++ 1980s
I have new respect for some of my kids, meeting the parents they've been dealt-- +++$+++ 1990s
Excuse me. I was just going up to my room. +++$+++ 2000s
We'll be stuck here for a little while -- about thirty minutes. +++$+++ 2000s
No, please. +++$+++ 1990s
And speaking of which, here's the light of my life, the pert and saucy Miss Julie McElroy. +++$+++ 2000s
Can it, Pluchinsky. And shove some cotton up your nose. +++$+++ 2000s
Well, he's killing now. +++$+++ 1970s
What is this? Why didn't you tell me? What?... I don't remember any of this. +++$+++ 1990s
Fifty-two disruptor banks, twenty-seven photon torpedo bays, primary and secondary phased shields. +++$+++ 2000s
What is your intended purpose of your visit to the United States? +++$+++ 2000s
What are you doing? +++$+++ 1980s
I'm sorry. +++$+++ 1990s
I dern near had me a touchdown till them boys got a-hold of me there so I figured I better give it off to you. I seen you over there follerin' me. +++$+++ 1990s
I don't. +++$+++ 1990s
This says "Mercer could not identify any of the photographs as being identical with the person she had observed slouched over the wheel of a green Ford pickup truck."  That's not true.  I recognized him and I told them so... They also said it was a dark green air conditioning truck, which it was not.  And here...  ...on the Dallas Sheriff's report. This is really strange.  See that notarized signature on the bottom of each page?  That's not my signature. And there never was any notary present during any of my questioning.  I guess that's all... +++$+++ 1990s
You think I don't know that? +++$+++ 2000s
Riddick...was thinkin' we should make some kind of deal. Just in case, you know, this actually -- +++$+++ 2000s
You want to ask her out tonight, right? And then you want to give her your school pin ... +++$+++ 1990s
A limousine has just pulled up. +++$+++ 1990s
I know you're cops, but I thought you were just here for that convention. I swear! All I wanted to do was clean up the room. I don't know anything about dope! +++$+++ 1990s
No, dammit! I mean me! That Rembrandt...that Rembrandt! +++$+++ 1990s
Relax. Make your mind a blank. +++$+++ 1980s
Why? +++$+++ 2000s
Come on. I want you. You're mine. You're mine! Come on! +++$+++ 1950s
Do you feel well enough for that? +++$+++ 1970s
Yes? +++$+++ 1970s
Yeah, the guy owes Momo a few G's. +++$+++ 1990s
Right. +++$+++ 1990s
Now who the hell is going to do that for me? +++$+++ 1980s
It strikes me that Eve's disloyalty and ingratitude must be contagious! +++$+++ 1950s
She looked dead. Still does. +++$+++ 1990s
Granville's looking for you anyway. +++$+++ 1970s
What happened? +++$+++ 2000s
Yeah. +++$+++ 1970s
Name the killer in HALLOWEEN. +++$+++ 1990s
Strange, that I have not. I wonder if your feelings on this matter are clear, Lord Vader. +++$+++ 1980s
So am I. +++$+++ 1990s
Oh yes. +++$+++ 1990s
You are so completely unbalanced. +++$+++ 1990s
Nobody's gonna take your baby. Know why?  Nobody cares...  Except me.  You wanna go back to your farm. You wanna go back to your family. I could take care of that baby. I'll look after her like she was me own. +++$+++ 1980s
Coming right to us! +++$+++ 1970s
Well, I'll get it from the safe. +++$+++ 1940s
What do you mean, what is it? It's some political bullshit. +++$+++ 1970s
Or sometimes not at all. +++$+++ 1990s
OK... whatever. +++$+++ 1990s
Some people aren't the athletic type. +++$+++ 1970s
Yes, sir. +++$+++ 2000s
France. +++$+++ 1970s
You'd die for fun? +++$+++ 1990s
No. Things are too hot. Later. I'll send for you. +++$+++ 1990s
Who?  Bond?  Bond is dead. +++$+++ 1990s
Whacking? +++$+++ 1980s
What do you mean, next? +++$+++ 1970s
I don't have to.  You'll be bustin' in on the Chief of Police just up the hall. +++$+++ 1970s
Well -- I -- +++$+++ 1990s
Oh. +++$+++ 1990s
That is of no interest. +++$+++ 1990s
Can't get off that shitty dump they live on.  What little money comes in goes to booze. +++$+++ 1990s
It's the best seat in the house. I warmed it up for you. +++$+++ 2000s
I know. They're rich drug addicts and celebrities. When I saw James Taylor there, and -- +++$+++ 1990s
There's this girl, this friend of mine from work that I think is really cute and really cool and I want you to meet her so I was thinking about bringing her to the party tonight. +++$+++ 2000s
I wouldn't worry about it. You've gotta figure most people around here were their teachers' pets. +++$+++ 2000s
Tell me the first thing that comes to your mind. +++$+++ 1990s
I will not permit any further testing on the eve of a mission.  We're already counting backwards. +++$+++ 1990s
So? +++$+++ 1950s
I know, Honey, but just think how exiting it will be-- new house, new school, new friends-- +++$+++ 1990s
You want another one of these, too? +++$+++ 1990s
You got Bank Americard? +++$+++ 1970s
David, I'm sorry I upset you yesterday, but you must understand what is going on. +++$+++ 1980s
Thanks, Mr. Gittes. +++$+++ 1970s
He is my defeated foe! +++$+++ 2000s
I don't know--let's break some windows. +++$+++ 1990s
Right back where we started. +++$+++ 2000s
You’re not playing with little boys now, scumbag. Where is the Austrian? +++$+++ 1990s
What are you doing ? +++$+++ 2000s
Yes. Can I - could I help you, in any way? +++$+++ 1980s
Bill...  ... where are you going? To find Eve? +++$+++ 1950s
You gonna jump?  Or are you just having a last look? +++$+++ 1990s
I-I'm sorry, Sam. +++$+++ 1990s
She's a little jealous, I think. And confused when it comes to men...  So where are we going? +++$+++ 2000s
Johnny... +++$+++ 1980s
That's not what I'm talking about, Pete. I'm talking about waking up and realizing this girl's gonna die. +++$+++ 2000s
Okay. +++$+++ 1990s
They're already dead.  They can't feel a thing. +++$+++ 1980s
Did you know about Bastaldi's deal with Zammito? +++$+++ 2000s
...I thought we agreed, no anti- Semitism...it's exactly what we're trying to put behind us.... Trash the blacks, fine; but... +++$+++ 2000s
Your words drove Bouchon to -- +++$+++ 2000s
I was looking for the Lieutenant Singh. +++$+++ 1990s
Sorry to interrupt you, sir, but I thought you'd like to know. +++$+++ 2000s
I can't do it. +++$+++ 1990s
I am all right, mama. That's why I called, to let you know. I gotta go. +++$+++ 1990s
A varied list of attractions. And which would you like to see first, Dan'l? +++$+++ 2000s
Hello.  Kay? +++$+++ 1970s
Madame Vice president. We have an options paper.  chandler takes the options paper, waves off Lee, and reads it as she talks. +++$+++ 1990s
I didn't know the people who gave them to me. +++$+++ 1970s
That's ridiculous. +++$+++ 1990s
What?  What did you say? +++$+++ 1990s
Erica. So do you think you and I are alike, Erica? +++$+++ 1990s
What do you think?  I left it on the curb? +++$+++ 1990s
Are you having a bad dream? +++$+++ 1980s
How about trying your fine Italian hand? +++$+++ 1930s
We're all getting a bit long in the tooth. +++$+++ 1990s
Let me see the map. +++$+++ 1990s
Yes. It has. +++$+++ 1970s
You really think so? +++$+++ 2000s
Please don't make me say it again. +++$+++ 1990s
Yes - +++$+++ 1990s
Maybe I do.  ...What a fuckin' mess, huh?  People can change Brian. +++$+++ 1990s
Not me, sir. Mr. Merrick. He succeeded in spite of my shortsightedness. +++$+++ 1980s
Cigarettes, candy bars...  PCP, crack... +++$+++ 1980s
Hey, man, gimme some skin. +++$+++ 1990s
Beynon. +++$+++ 1970s
Snuff clip.  It was Iris.  She said she needed my help and I... aw Jesus, Mace... the sick fucker killed her. +++$+++ 1990s
Sure. Why? +++$+++ 2000s
Excuse me. +++$+++ 1990s
We're gonna talk. +++$+++ 1990s
Call ya later. +++$+++ 2000s
Nicky. I was thinking about you. I went to the preview last night. +++$+++ 2000s
It was Henry Follett. +++$+++ 1990s
I don't think so. +++$+++ 1970s
No! +++$+++ 2000s
Rick? +++$+++ 1940s
Oh? What do you do to make ends meet? +++$+++ 1970s
Mazel Tov! +++$+++ 2000s
I'm booted up.  Go, Ethan. +++$+++ 2000s
What is that? +++$+++ 2000s
And don't apologize.  Every time I try to talk to someone it's sorry this and forgive me that and I'm not worthy and ... What are you doing now? +++$+++ 1970s
How come in former lifetimes, everybody was someone famous?  How come nobody ever says they were Joe Schmo? +++$+++ 1980s
Would you like to go for a walk? +++$+++ 1930s
So, he knows where you are. That means he's sending some guys over here probably right now. +++$+++ 1990s
Seven hundred for the pair. +++$+++ 1990s
OK. Roger. +++$+++ 1990s
What am I going to to do with this guy?  Pierce, I was just on the phone with Borough Command. Out of twelve shifts this month, you've been late for nine, sick four and that includes the shift where you came late and went home early. +++$+++ 1990s
Who is it? +++$+++ 1990s
Shut up! +++$+++ 1980s
You talkin' to me about Ramada Inn? +++$+++ 2000s
Find something? +++$+++ 1980s
Don't kid me.  You don't think she murdered Mitchell. +++$+++ 1990s
I am not -- I just think it'd be funny to see what he'd do... +++$+++ 2000s
Don't do that, man, okay? +++$+++ 1990s
Before he lost his powers of speech, he told me his one comfort was that he would live to know Wallace was dead. +++$+++ 1990s
To be honest Mary Sue. I didn't think you'd want to come here until we'd been pinned for a little while. +++$+++ 1990s
She is here. +++$+++ 2000s
Yeah? No kidding. Listen, you still want to go girl hunting tonight? +++$+++ 1990s
Moving along -  A typical plastic security card. Name here, magnetic information stripe here -  And a code breaking microprocessor here. Swipe it through any card reader - anywhere - you're in. +++$+++ 1990s
If you really want to do something for me, you can stop making this scene right now. +++$+++ 2000s
That's swell. However, the music, if you want to pursue it, well, the lessons from Mrs Swan, they'll only take you so far. There's this guy in San Francisco, I've made inquiries, everybody says he's the best. Trained lots of people who've gone on to have big concert careers, symphony orchestras, the works. His name is Jacques Carcanogues. I'm not sure I'm pronouncing it right. Anyway, he's a Frenchman. +++$+++ 2000s
I'm sorry, it's just that... I was told to wake you up gently, so I figured... +++$+++ 1990s
No place special.  Just hanging out. +++$+++ 1970s
What? +++$+++ 1960s
Yes. +++$+++ 1930s
You okay -- ? +++$+++ 2000s
Gregoire it is good to see you back to work. +++$+++ 2000s
What? +++$+++ 1980s
Open it. +++$+++ 1990s
Sure!  Sure, I'm on my way. +++$+++ 1960s
Could she be doin' okay, Johnnie? She's tryin' to prove somethin' to me, that's all. Lula ain't doin' no more'n showin' off, defyin' me...  Johnnie, I've done somethin' bad... +++$+++ 1990s
Harry, if I gave you Leo's money you'd have Ray Bones all over your ass and then you'd be in a whole new kinda trouble. +++$+++ 1990s
Sure.  Can I ask you one more thing? You haven't published anything in a while.  How come? +++$+++ 1990s
And look what happened to that. +++$+++ 1990s
Who was the other man? +++$+++ 1940s
This is Barry. +++$+++ 2000s
Just come to the Mudd Club on Friday. +++$+++ 1990s
Did you look for his passport, driving licence? +++$+++ 1990s
Shit!  I... I, which way? +++$+++ 1990s
So he knows your name? +++$+++ 1990s
What is it, Rakonin? Did you lose your job? +++$+++ 1930s
Can't be much of a crime, if all they got minding the area is a cocky kid. +++$+++ 1990s
Is it still dripping? +++$+++ 1970s
I am interested in the Eiffel Tower from a technical standpoint. +++$+++ 1930s
The kids are grown! They don't need you anymore. You told me that. They hardly talk to you. +++$+++ 1990s
I'm up for that... +++$+++ 1990s
What? +++$+++ 1980s
I'm sorry if I've ruined your day, Mr. Reynard. But my client's had a rough eight years behind bars and -- +++$+++ 1980s
Jeez, I don't know where you're ever going to find a guy like that. +++$+++ 1990s
I'm telling ya, it's over.  We used it all up-- +++$+++ 1990s
There's somethin' funny going on around here. +++$+++ 1940s
He's a goddamn drug dealer! These are his peak hours. +++$+++ 2000s
Halden sent men to kill me in my sleep, but simple illusions won out.  So he now sends the legend to finish the deed. +++$+++ 1920s
Torture cage.  Can't stand... can't sit... for days.  Sometimes weeks. +++$+++ 1980s
Why not? +++$+++ 1990s
Ah-ha.  So what is that--a radio? +++$+++ 1990s
Right. Planes get hit by lightning. They get hit by meteors. They hit other planes. +++$+++ 1990s
...a case, so, so <u>fascinating</u>, so... +++$+++ 2000s
Clarissa. Oh. Uh-huh.  Well, Saunders--let's go-- +++$+++ 1930s
Ain't that something? +++$+++ 1990s
Don't worry, Milo. I'm here as a friend. Or maybe a supplicant. +++$+++ 2000s
What's Doug do in Chicago? +++$+++ 1980s
I've been wondering if maybe Jack shot Twombley, instead of Twombley shooting himself. I've been wondering maybe Jack shot him on purpose. +++$+++ 1990s
Sure.  Bettina Peterson.  Marfa, Texas. Let's run a current check. +++$+++ 2000s
Not down in my parts. +++$+++ 1990s
So she flies - +++$+++ 2000s
No more drugs.  Please... +++$+++ 1990s
Ms.  Mitchell.  So nice to finally meet you in person. +++$+++ 1990s
See Threepio!  Do you copy? +++$+++ 1970s
All right, but present it to him as a great cause for the common man. +++$+++ 1940s
Alan! +++$+++ 1980s
I mean -- about my getting a divorce. +++$+++ 1960s
If his girlfriend was knocked up. +++$+++ 1990s
How you doing, Bob? +++$+++ 1990s
You know how when we close up, I close the register, then you lower the shades, then I turn out the lights, then we both lock the doors. +++$+++ 1990s
I know, man. +++$+++ 1950s
That's what I wanted you to tell me. +++$+++ 2000s
The last time he come in here. You hear that, Nick? +++$+++ 1940s
Good. Then may I have the honor of extending an invitation to you? +++$+++ 1990s
Why you nitwit. You almost destroyed the most sensitive deal of my career! +++$+++ 1990s
Right. Seven.  Christ, that’s a long time, isn’t it? +++$+++ 2000s
Man, is this interesting. +++$+++ 1960s
They all like this in your family, father? +++$+++ 1990s
It's not just Sid 6.7's performances that are increasing. Stars need bigger and bigger audiences.  Whatever Sid is going to do next, it's going to involve media. +++$+++ 1990s
Laurence! +++$+++ 1990s
Tattoo. Had it taken off. +++$+++ 1970s
--sorry--got an appointment to play shuffle-board. +++$+++ 1930s
Yes, you. We're looking for our room... 1002. +++$+++ 1980s
We pushed it. We got lazy. +++$+++ 2000s
I know, but -- +++$+++ 1990s
So you see what I'm <u>saying</u>...the movie is about <u>purity</u>... +++$+++ 2000s
What’s in it for me? Where are my Mary Janes? +++$+++ 2000s
The bastard.  He can blow his nose all the way. +++$+++ 1970s
For a celebrated bounder, that is an awful admission. Besides, I never knew that any female could do this to you . +++$+++ 1930s
Franky can't make it. He had an appointment he forgot, he's going to see you later. I'm Mickey Morrissey, we're supposed to get to know each other. +++$+++ 1980s
It's for wheat. We've always grown maize in the strip above the vegetables. +++$+++ 1960s
Everything's fine, honey. We don't need to talk. Besides I have to work late. +++$+++ 2000s
Objection, Your Honor. This isn't about Mrs. Rexroth's filial obligations. +++$+++ 2000s
Nah, he's nothin'. It's just sometimes... sometimes you just gotta punch somebody out, y'know? +++$+++ 1990s
You look sharp. You understand? +++$+++ 1980s
Shit! +++$+++ 2000s
You know I have lectured at the University of Maryland in your country?  Also University Michigan Very nice country. We both go back. +++$+++ 1970s
Gaston! +++$+++ 1930s
I'm not acting!  I don't want to go in it, okay? +++$+++ 1980s
The death of my father. +++$+++ 1990s
I don't question the legality of what you do.  It's your morality that makes me sick.  I will not allow my company to be raped by a man like you. +++$+++ 1990s
Not tonight no more. He ain't coming. Uh, he went home. +++$+++ 1940s
What's that, written on the sail? +++$+++ 2000s
The poet...something he said... +++$+++ 1980s
You're going to throw away our life together for some shared experience with a looney-tune that you misguidedly think is love? +++$+++ 2000s
So go shower already. +++$+++ 2000s
Can it work? +++$+++ 2000s
Are you ok? +++$+++ 1990s
What for?  I can say anything I want with my eyes. +++$+++ 1950s
No. I couldn't. +++$+++ 1990s
-- and this is confidential? +++$+++ 2000s
Professor, if something does go wrong tonight... if I don't get my parents back together... when do you think I'd cease to exist? +++$+++ 1980s
All I'm saying is that Amity is a summer town -- we need summer dollars, and if they can't swim here, they'll use the beaches at Cape Cod, or Long Island. +++$+++ 1970s
Your <u>shoes</u> cost a thousand dollars? +++$+++ 1990s
Ha ha... +++$+++ 1980s
NO! GOD, NO... +++$+++ 1990s
I still ain't sure what my daddy looks like. +++$+++ 1990s
Sleep is all stress reduction. Here.  You take one of these, sleep two hours, that's all you need.  Why do you think I'm telling you this, Frank--for my health?  You ought to look at yourself in the mirror, man. Kanita, get him a glass of water. +++$+++ 1990s
So, what are you seeing? +++$+++ 1990s
The blood type on the rocks matches Suzie's. +++$+++ 1990s
Put me down for ten, you louse. +++$+++ 1950s
You lame or something? +++$+++ 1980s
He said that the shit could get hot, could get heavy... I said good.  'Cuz I got two of the hottest, heaviest bitches alive. +++$+++ 2000s
That's right. +++$+++ 1990s
-- Don't tell me where you're going. +++$+++ 1940s
Of course. +++$+++ 1980s
Why should I be afraid of you? What are you holding over me? +++$+++ 1940s
He's retarded's all. You know he's always after a father figure and Lord knows Doyle ain't a good one with his mean ass. +++$+++ 1990s
I'm telling you, Animal, these Nazis ain't Kosher. +++$+++ 1950s
Oh don't.  Everyone says that. +++$+++ 2000s
Oh that makes a lot of sense. Why would I rat myself out? +++$+++ 1990s
Is that a game? +++$+++ 1980s
We did it. +++$+++ 1980s
Let us explore it together. +++$+++ 1980s
I heard about the Kentucky gag order... +++$+++ 1990s
Something's wrong. I know it.  I've heard rumors of cholera spreading south from Hamburg. +++$+++ 1930s
Goodbye. +++$+++ 1980s
I'm so hungry. +++$+++ 2000s
You want me to bring the VCR over here so we can watch this? +++$+++ 1990s
No... no, excuse me Eve. As quickly as I see fit. +++$+++ 1980s
Wise one, the French fathers made peace and swore to their honor not to break the friendship. Magua broke it. It is false that the French would not be friends, still, to the Huron. +++$+++ 1970s
Nothing. +++$+++ 1990s
Highly suspect. +++$+++ 1990s
Bite? +++$+++ 1980s
You know that's not true. +++$+++ 2000s
It's running three meters down. Twenty knots. +++$+++ 2000s
For defending my honor this afternoon. +++$+++ 1970s
Pure idiot. +++$+++ 2000s
Captain, we can't see her, but she gives off heat... +++$+++ 1990s
Yeah. You? +++$+++ 1990s
It's her, isn't it? +++$+++ 1990s
I don't know. +++$+++ 1970s
Where is she?! +++$+++ 1990s
Get your people out of there or I will. +++$+++ 1990s
That I am not Rheya.  That Rheya died.  Killed herself.  I'm different. +++$+++ 2000s
I thought you were living in San Francisco. Or was it Nepal? +++$+++ 2000s
Yes. +++$+++ 1940s
You might be better off legally as well as financially to just go for the -- +++$+++ 1990s
You were supposed to go downstairs, baby. +++$+++ 1990s
What's that? A Democrat with an attitude! +++$+++ 2000s
Pelting down out there. +++$+++ 2000s
Beauty and fragrances. +++$+++ 2000s
I just can't, son--not the head and tail both! +++$+++ 1930s
Yes, it was -- I ended up -- +++$+++ 1990s
Where do you think Jerry is? +++$+++ 1990s
Inspector Halloran, Homicide.  I'm in charge here. +++$+++ 1990s
I can't afford to make exceptions. Once word leaks out that a pirate has gone soft, people begin to disobey you, and then it's nothing but work, work, work, all the time. +++$+++ 1980s
All right, darling. +++$+++ 2000s
I can smell it. +++$+++ 1990s
What can I say? +++$+++ 1970s
Hey, boy - I'm talkin' to you. +++$+++ 1960s
I know.  That was for the smell. +++$+++ 2000s
I'm sorry. I didn't mean to upset you... but you still didn't answer the question. +++$+++ 1990s
It would have been so easy to let him in as you went out. +++$+++ 1990s
May I remind you that Duncan has the <u>client</u> arriving at exac... +++$+++ 1990s
Is that all... think real hard. +++$+++ 2000s
Nah, they'd shut down the pin number. +++$+++ 1990s
Mav's a great flyer but.... +++$+++ 1980s
It's the cops.  Shit! +++$+++ 1970s
Oh come on Harry, we're talking about five days here. +++$+++ 1990s
Yes. +++$+++ 1990s
There, what? I didn't see anything. +++$+++ 2000s
What is that, Mahogany? What happens if you crack the neck? +++$+++ 2000s
So they tell us.  But what are we to believe when the king is a tyrant, and the Church, meant to stand for all those oppressed, has become the tool of oppression?  When no conscience is tolerated?  No dissent, no objection? +++$+++ 1990s
If we move in a group, we are one target. If we scatter, they CAN'T get us all. +++$+++ 2000s
Command, Eagle One. Switching to "sidewinders." We're moving in. +++$+++ 1990s
Nix. +++$+++ 1990s
Forgive me, but it really is intoxicating being a news source. +++$+++ 1980s
You're leaving tomorrow? +++$+++ 1970s
Not mad, but bound more than a mad-man is; Shut up in prison, kept without my food, Whipp'd and tormented. Good day, good fellow. +++$+++ 1960s
Hi, Rob and Carrie. +++$+++ 2000s
Then do you understand that I cannot tell the truth here?  In Dallas. That there are people here who do not want me to tell the truth... who do not want me to have a retrial? +++$+++ 1990s
You know I liked it better long. +++$+++ 1960s
Just what I had in mind.  Everything dead on Earth except us.  A chance for mother nature to start again.  Plants and flowers are the oldest species on the planet yet they are defenseless against man.  Sorry hon, this is for science.  Behold the dawn of a new age. +++$+++ 1940s
Ain't you gonna look back, Ma?--give the ol' place a last look? +++$+++ 1940s
Hey, Chinese people have this energy field that vibrates at a particular frequency. +++$+++ 1980s
Oh!  I didn't see you there, sneaky boy!  You're like a boy sneaking in... +++$+++ 2000s
But I thought -- +++$+++ 1990s
Why? +++$+++ 2000s
Well get used to it, 'cause here we are, on the cruise of a lifetime. +++$+++ 1990s
Check forging. +++$+++ 1990s
Could you help me-- what was the name of that girl who just came in... +++$+++ 1990s
Well...I guess it's okay for me to tell you now.  That reputation of his isn't going anywhere.  Finch comes to me and says, "Jessica, I need help with this, blah blah, etcetera."  So I told him, pay me two- hundred bucks, and I'll tell a couple girls that you're dynamite in bed.  So he did, and I did. +++$+++ 1990s
Fuck you, too.  Pardon my French. +++$+++ 1990s
Sometimes she can be quite careless. Why don't you try Mrs. Redi? +++$+++ 1940s
Do you believe she really saw them? +++$+++ 1980s
Huh? +++$+++ 1990s
Interesting. +++$+++ 2000s
The Justice Department guy who came to the apartment when -- +++$+++ 2000s
Okay.  I'll meet you at the dock in ten minutes. +++$+++ 1990s
Chill out Edgar. +++$+++ 1980s
Romeo Tango Zulu1 this is Tower. +++$+++ 1990s
Dr. Weir, what's this the door to? +++$+++ 1990s
I don't wanna think.  I wanna drink. +++$+++ 1980s
You drew this?! +++$+++ 2000s
Well, she went somewhere! She didn't just up and disappear into thin air! +++$+++ 1990s
Bitch... You little bitch! +++$+++ 1990s
She didn't want me to be a climber. She wanted me to be a planner like her. +++$+++ 2000s
I want... I want to... +++$+++ 2000s
That's right. +++$+++ 1970s
I bought him a watch too. +++$+++ 1990s
Who's Lednov? +++$+++ 1940s
You fainted last night after supper. The master and I carried you here. +++$+++ 1960s
I'm sorry. She misunderstood, that's all. +++$+++ 1980s
How do you turn this thing off? +++$+++ 1990s
We can't leave him out here, open the door. +++$+++ 1970s
Not too expensive -- I'm not a lady of leisure anymore. +++$+++ 1960s
So then what, Mr. Wandering Jack? +++$+++ 1990s
Mr. President, there is another possibility we haven't considered. This may not be a coup at all. +++$+++ 2000s
There's nothing sudden about that—  He's always loved the girl, but he was such a sap he didn't have sense enough to tell her. Well, that's all right - we can fix that. He will go to the little O'Brien girl, and - here, I'll show you. +++$+++ 1930s
Who won? +++$+++ 1930s
Um, uh, butt... um, hole. Butt-hole... +++$+++ 1990s
I insist. +++$+++ 2000s
I just don't think it's right, killing an innocent girl. +++$+++ 1980s
This is the greatest moment of your life and you're off somewhere, missing it. +++$+++ 1990s
It was ridiculous; all this at three o'clock in the morning. +++$+++ 2000s
You were? I thought you were chasing me? +++$+++ 1940s
No.  JP.  My last boyfriend?  He like owns the club.  You know?  You were there?  He bought the statue. +++$+++ 1990s
Gone. +++$+++ 1990s
Last time I saw you, weren't you up for some equity-waiver thing? +++$+++ 1990s
See, Frank's being smart about this. +++$+++ 2000s
I'm going to miss you. +++$+++ 2000s
...When did you know all this? +++$+++ 2000s
No false modesty, lad.  You're a proper champion.  Achilles' armor sits on you like it was forged to fit. +++$+++ 1980s
Once in a while, you know. I mean, you know, every now- +++$+++ 1970s
So you sat it out, that's what you did? +++$+++ 1990s
Wait a minute - let me out. +++$+++ 1940s
H'ya, Carl--h'ya, Bill! +++$+++ 1930s
I know, I met him. +++$+++ 1980s
I had to inspect the merchandise first. +++$+++ 2000s
Your parents would want you to be in bed. +++$+++ 1990s
"Why?" If I asked questions like that, I'd never make love-"love"-- Damn you, Damn this, damnit! +++$+++ 2000s
For God's sake, tell him I'm on my way.  Let's go, Chucky.  A police escort is gonna pick us up en route.  You too, LaPlante. +++$+++ 1990s
Thanks, man.  I've been hating myself for the last two days. +++$+++ 1990s
Oh, I'd say about -- +++$+++ 1990s
Thank you for at least sounding sincere. +++$+++ 2000s
What am I supposed to do? +++$+++ 1970s
Big giant <u>capacitor</u>.  And that, instead of generating power it'll sort of be --  -- <u>sucking</u> power, from Gotham City, and storing it ... stockpiling it, sort of?  Which, unless I'm being dense, is a novel approach, I'd say. +++$+++ 1990s
A date. What, are you a hooker?  What do you mean a date?  I've got a wife back home. I just came over to talk for a few minutes. +++$+++ 1990s
So what do you suggest, we go to a hotel? We got a guy who's shot in the belly, he can't walk, he bleeds like a stuck pig, and when he's awake, he screams in pain. +++$+++ 1990s
No whistles, but a Club You bring a hack -- ? +++$+++ 2000s
What do you mean? +++$+++ 1980s
The creature!? Are you sure!? +++$+++ 1990s
I didn't kill my wife. +++$+++ 2000s
Why there? +++$+++ 1990s
Exactly.  Why not bring them? +++$+++ 1990s
What common objects? +++$+++ 1970s
Like hell they wouldn't. +++$+++ 1960s
Charlie, just because a man and his family are colored, you-- +++$+++ 1970s
He was in the bank yesterday. +++$+++ 1930s
INT. POSTAL VAN - DAY. +++$+++ 1990s
<i>New York Times</i>...? +++$+++ 2000s
I don't believe you have "things." +++$+++ 2000s
I had a partner and she fucked me. +++$+++ 1990s
We got you...it's okay, it's okay...we got you now.... +++$+++ 2000s
You'll get blown outta here some day. +++$+++ 1970s
You like him, don't you?  Your voice changes. +++$+++ 1990s
You quit trying to stop anybody— +++$+++ 1930s
Demons... This wouldn't have been possible without you... You have given me incentive ELLEN - I can see clearer now... +++$+++ 1990s
Dog tags. [Off her blank look] They've got your name and date of birth for identification. +++$+++ 2000s
Yes, I can tell that just looking around.  "Boy?"  Did you say you were a "country boy?" +++$+++ 1990s
I have committed no sin. +++$+++ 1980s
I killed him!  I killed him! +++$+++ 1980s
Okay +++$+++ 2000s
Devil's confusion. What's this I hear about you not getting out of bed?  I saw Denver. She tell you? +++$+++ 1990s
But the idea's good, if we could just turn it around somehow. +++$+++ 1970s
I feel like such a tramp - taking jewelry from a man under false pretenses. +++$+++ 1950s
Miles? You're scaring me. +++$+++ 2000s
I'm just going to get some ice. +++$+++ 1950s
I don't think we can treat this as a formality.  Mr. Kennedy made a verbal promise to the Russians not to invade Cuba.  But you authorized Dr. Kissinger to put this in writing. +++$+++ 1990s
You never have dessert. +++$+++ 1980s
Always. +++$+++ 1990s
Jesus... this is inhuman.  Uh... I wasn't told of any operations in this area. They shouldn't have been here. +++$+++ 1980s
Elizabeth!?!  'Can't waits any longer.  Arrive in your arms at ten tonight.' Oh, God!  Not tonight. +++$+++ 1970s
Yes?  Yes? +++$+++ 2000s
Yeah.  It was a rush thing.  They needed some documents down at the court house.  I barely made it. +++$+++ 1990s
Goodnight to you, Susan. +++$+++ 1990s
Look. All I want is a haircut. I'm not worried about this guy. +++$+++ 2000s
Henslowe, you have no soul so how can you understand the emptiness that seeks a soulmate? +++$+++ 1990s
They've got Quaid!  They're protecting him! +++$+++ 1990s
My marriage is the worst. All crap. A big pile of shit. +++$+++ 1980s
How nice. You remembered. But of course, that was the day the Germans marched into Paris. +++$+++ 1940s
And big for his age. +++$+++ 1980s
Gotta be here someplace.  Thought I heard a couple of dead Christians singing down there. +++$+++ 1970s
So what?  So what?  For starters, how about littering is a crime. +++$+++ 1990s
Just below ten thousand. +++$+++ 1980s
I'll go and get my valise. +++$+++ 1960s
Checking connection. +++$+++ 1920s
No.  What you do today? +++$+++ 2000s
Let's go.  Everybody take off? +++$+++ 1990s
I just called to say that I'm having a really great time. +++$+++ 1990s
By your Austrian? +++$+++ 1990s
You'll get over it. We've got a knockdown, airtight, motherfucker of a lawsuit against Sandra Van Ryan. +++$+++ 1990s
About what? +++$+++ 1990s
What do we do? +++$+++ 1990s
I've been ordered into bed.  The doctor says I've gotten the flu, or some other wretched ailment. +++$+++ 1990s
We know there's got to be something or they wouldn't be so panicked. +++$+++ 1970s
Arnie, this is crazy. +++$+++ 2000s
Why you say that?  Just because I help a lady with her package? +++$+++ 1990s
Who is this? +++$+++ 1990s
Me?  How would I know?  The only reason she ran off was to get away from her rather sizable debt to me. +++$+++ 1990s
I don't know. Maybe we should have moved. +++$+++ 1990s
Check the permits.  It was built as a guesthouse.  It's a legally rentable unit grandfathered when South Laguna was incorporated. +++$+++ 2000s
Hell, no! I just got something in my eye. +++$+++ 2000s
Yeah-well, you wanted to keep the relationship flexible, remember? It's your phrase. +++$+++ 1970s
Sent it. +++$+++ 1990s
Well, I'm sorry, I-I can't... I-I- I've gotta see a picture exactly from the start to the finish, 'cause- 'cause I'm anal. +++$+++ 1970s
What kinda beer do you like? +++$+++ 1990s
No. +++$+++ 2000s
Richard Taupin has become cumbersome.  It would be best if he just disappeared. +++$+++ 1980s
I'm not worried. +++$+++ 1990s
I found a broken gasket, from space -- +++$+++ 1990s
How'd you know he died, he tell you? +++$+++ 1990s
OTIS, your brain defies any known scientific laws in its infinite capacity to deteriorate. Every man has a vulnerable point. Some like you Otis, have more that one. I didn't see Superman's in time. But now through patience, invention and skill, my 	black box is just about ready. +++$+++ 1980s
I made no such promise.  Sound the retreat for the night! +++$+++ 2000s
Jesus! +++$+++ 2000s
Bet I do. +++$+++ 1980s
Uh-huh. While I was sitting there, trying to make my mind up, a cop stuck his head in the car, because I was illegally parked -- so I started to hide the gun under the seat and it went off -- pow! +++$+++ 1960s
Too young? +++$+++ 1990s
I gotta go. Love ya mom. +++$+++ 1990s
Mr. Sebastian is a host who wants to be appreciated.  We'll appreciate him and he'll cooperate. +++$+++ 1980s
I did kill us. She thinks we’re dead. And she thinks she got away with it. +++$+++ 1990s
Or something will be able to see us. +++$+++ 1970s
If there's gold.  If! +++$+++ 1990s
My name is Li Mu Bai.  The Green Destiny is mine.  Jade Fox can't be your master.  Where did you learn that "Xuan Piu" move? +++$+++ 2000s
What would be a good time for you? +++$+++ 2000s
After fifty years there ain't nothin' left but shoe leather. +++$+++ 2000s
Let me talk to Mickey. +++$+++ 1980s
Mom, please. +++$+++ 2000s
Can I help you? +++$+++ 1970s
Deserts you?  Harry said he'd take over for me. +++$+++ 1990s
When do we go? +++$+++ 2000s
Who are "they?" +++$+++ 1990s
Half - I'm comin' down. +++$+++ 1990s
That's funny - I never slept better.  And I had the most wonderful dream.  I was still on the yacht, and the anchor broke loose - and we drifted for days and days - you were the captain and I was the crew - I kept a lookout for icebergs, and I sorted your shells, and mixed your cocktails, and wiped the steam off your glasses - and when I woke up, I felt like swimming right back to you. +++$+++ 1950s
I asked you to wake me when Babe Brother comes. +++$+++ 1990s
That is a matter of opinion. +++$+++ 1990s
Don't do it. +++$+++ 1970s
I'm your future husband, remember? +++$+++ 1980s
I, uh... +++$+++ 2000s
Yes, but. +++$+++ 1980s
Oh, 'cause you got it like dat? +++$+++ 2000s
Loomis. Haddonfield. +++$+++ 1980s
Are you sure you...? +++$+++ 1990s
I'm telling you, I saw somebody. I don't know who it was. But I saw somebody. +++$+++ 2000s
That's not where I am.  Miller No? Where are you? +++$+++ 1990s
But you're not going to stop her? +++$+++ 1990s
Not at all. +++$+++ 1950s
It was futile. We went all over. +++$+++ 1960s
BETTY, I NEED TO TALK TO YOU... IN PERSON! WHERE'RE YOU AT? +++$+++ 2000s
Ahhh - no - stop - I mean Janet.  Janet. +++$+++ 1970s
Take it,easy, boy...  Seems to me you're different than a lotta boys that come to me. Most of 'em seem troubled, confused, but I'd say you knew exactly what you want. +++$+++ 1960s
Where the hell we going to get us a football team? +++$+++ 1970s
Maybe I am three-eighty-five if you carry a second lien!  I can arrange the most creative financing in the six states of New England. +++$+++ 1980s
What do you want? +++$+++ 1980s
No! +++$+++ 1980s
No. +++$+++ 1990s
Did you say Cable Junction? +++$+++ 1970s
I... have come to communicate with my User. +++$+++ 1980s
How'd they know who you were? +++$+++ 2000s
I told Regan that was holy water, I sprinkled some on her and she reacted very violently. It's tap water. +++$+++ 1970s
What? +++$+++ 1970s
Yeah? About fifty people I didn't know wrote that in my annual. +++$+++ 1980s
It's there! +++$+++ 1970s
How do you stop The Screamer? +++$+++ 1990s
Yes, it's lame. +++$+++ 1990s
From one professional to another, of course. +++$+++ 1990s
Want me to take over? +++$+++ 1970s
Who gave you this idea? What is responsible for all this? +++$+++ 1930s
Wait a minute - +++$+++ 1990s
Yes -- but I am afraid of being deceived. +++$+++ 1970s
I think you're fucking crazy! +++$+++ 1990s
In a moment. +++$+++ 1930s
Nope, you got a little surprise over there, Shorty. +++$+++ 1980s
You can tell that from here? +++$+++ 1950s
What? +++$+++ 1970s
Yeah, the sensitive guy-thing never worked for me. +++$+++ 2000s
Aye, OK, Fr.  But the good times couldn't last for ever. +++$+++ 1990s
You're possessive. +++$+++ 2000s
Just take a look at it. +++$+++ 1980s
Here. It looks like you need a refill. +++$+++ 1960s
You still didn't answer my question. +++$+++ 1960s
Ricky Hendricks has to cancel today. He didn't say what he was canceling or why. +++$+++ 2000s
If I weren't married? +++$+++ 2000s
We don't take hints. +++$+++ 2000s
Yeah.  The Inferno. +++$+++ 1990s
I just figured you was out bein' Mr. Cool... +++$+++ 1990s
Aloha! Welcome! +++$+++ 1990s
Fine.  Go home.  Who needs you. +++$+++ 2000s
Did you tell Veronica? +++$+++ 1990s
Had enough? +++$+++ 1970s
'Oughta give up smoking, Jocko. +++$+++ 1960s
Oh come on! +++$+++ 1990s
Easy to fix.  Wyatt Berry Stapp Earp. +++$+++ 1990s
1922. Why the kippers? +++$+++ 1990s
He left his sweater. +++$+++ 1990s
Handbook for the recently diseased. +++$+++ 1980s
Do I have to? +++$+++ 2000s
Okay. See you later, friend. +++$+++ 2000s
Cool. What'd it do to you guys? +++$+++ 2000s
Mind that shrapnel DAWN thrusts a brass regimental hat badge in BILL'S face. +++$+++ 1980s
Well, what do you think? +++$+++ 1990s
Jack, for crying out loud.  Your bachelorhood's showing.  Ah, here we go. +++$+++ 1980s
Why what? +++$+++ 1990s
Mr. Gordon— +++$+++ 1930s
Hid by day--fought by night.  At sunset one day, your father and I, peering through field glasses, saw a black Mercedes draw up to a village inn.  It was escorted by two motorcyclists and an armored car.  Out of the Mercedes stepped one of the most hateful men in all of history--the Beast of Yugoslavia. +++$+++ 1970s
Jim, I've got to go.  I'm already late-- +++$+++ 1970s
Don't you have a hockey game at two? +++$+++ 1990s
You're strapped into an implant chair, and I'm monitoring you at a psycho-probe console. +++$+++ 1990s
I said - try again. +++$+++ 1970s
No, I want to walk. +++$+++ 1960s
You want to give me your gun now, Plato? +++$+++ 1950s
What do you mean? +++$+++ 1960s
"He" wanted me to warn you.  Look at this, all of you! +++$+++ 1980s
That's okay -- really it is. +++$+++ 1990s
Hey, you hear about the chick that came in today? Said some chick bit her at Victoria's Secret. Bitches are outta control these days. +++$+++ 1980s
Yes. +++$+++ 1980s
Thank you, Baron. +++$+++ 1930s
Your lambs are still for now, Clarice, but not forever... You'll have to earn it again and again, this blessed silence. Because it's the plight that drives you, and the plight will never end. +++$+++ 1990s
Yes. We went to the address we were given and had to tie up the owner of the house who turns out to be some Mafia guy. +++$+++ 2000s
You bet I will, Ma. +++$+++ 1940s
It is unlikely. America, perhaps. There is great anti-communist feeling in America. +++$+++ 1990s
What with the psychosis and all, yeah. +++$+++ 1990s
Should I? +++$+++ 1990s
And you certainly shouldn't settle for anything less that you deserve. +++$+++ 1990s
You're pretty charming when you want to be. +++$+++ 1980s
From the lip wound, which happened seven hours before he got burned, we've narrowed it down to those cities within the seven-hour driving radius that also would've caught the 'Tattler' early Tuesday morning. +++$+++ 1980s
Why? +++$+++ 2000s
Not yet you know any of these people? +++$+++ 1980s
No, uh, nobody. It's, uh, it's my birthday this week and Sooze's brother might come by to wish me a happy birthday. +++$+++ 1990s
A very large pig. +++$+++ 1990s
No. +++$+++ 1990s
I am Lieutenant Dunbar. +++$+++ 1950s
Valcour. His chair. +++$+++ 2000s
There's a hawk around. They're scared tonight. +++$+++ 1950s
How long have you been married? +++$+++ 2000s
What?!  You aborted our child?! +++$+++ 2000s
Okay, I know you've suffered a terrible loss, and there's really nothing anyone can do to comfort you, but I urge you to focus on the times you had with the camper, the trips you took, the sights you saw, those days are gone now, but they'll live on in your heart forever. +++$+++ 1990s
Mrs. Stanwyk! +++$+++ 1980s
Let's mingle a little, shall we? +++$+++ 1990s
I am, Sir...Sergeant Al Powell. +++$+++ 1980s
Victor, your scar -- +++$+++ 1990s
So, there are rules.  Things you do and things you don't do. +++$+++ 1990s
What do you mean, old and ugly? +++$+++ 2000s
Does it cause drowsiness?  That's all we need.  To get him unconscious -- put him under. +++$+++ 1990s
It's been a while. +++$+++ 1980s
I'm dead. We're both dead. +++$+++ 1980s
Like firing Andrew Beckett taught <u>him</u> a lesson? +++$+++ 1990s
Please, hurry... +++$+++ 1980s
We're going to rope this banker tomorrow and you gotta at least look classy, if not be classy. You gotta do this thing and I don't even know if you can. +++$+++ 2000s
Redstone's the army training center in Alabama where they send the cream of the crop to learn about tickers. +++$+++ 2000s
All I knew, she was pulling away. It made me crazy. +++$+++ 2000s
Maybe by now they are. +++$+++ 1970s
Will you defy your father and your Queen? +++$+++ 1990s
Yeah! +++$+++ 1990s
So.  You found him. +++$+++ 1990s
How do you do? +++$+++ 1970s
I don't want it now. +++$+++ 1930s
Things worked out.  I made some money over there, had some laughs, you know. It was good. +++$+++ 1990s
I'm not your pupil.  I was, but I'm not. +++$+++ 1980s
Not that.  Us. +++$+++ 1990s
Came back three days ago. +++$+++ 1940s
Finish it up without the lip. +++$+++ 1990s
Can we take a dip? +++$+++ 2000s
It's okay.  What happened? +++$+++ 1970s
Well, Bruce -- I don't think -- that would be possible. +++$+++ 1980s
No, Waski, she won't die, because we are praying for her. +++$+++ 1990s
One. The radio's rappin' about $750^000. We only got a half a million. +++$+++ 1970s
No, you didn't! +++$+++ 1980s
What's so special about it? +++$+++ 2000s
I mean, seventy-five is too early, but at eighty-five, well, you're just marking time and you may as well look over the horizon. +++$+++ 1970s
I'm about to be killed and you "Shhh" me!  This wasn't my case, Lee.  Ricky Tan didn't kill my father, the Fu-Cang Long are not in South Central.  I didn't have to help you. +++$+++ 2000s
Later for that, Walt, let's get this:  we need the "pages" for the new "Old Mill"...alright?  We need a new title, we need a... +++$+++ 2000s
Now, lasher - it is our time. +++$+++ 1990s
Well to be honest, Etienne, I would rather have not known about it. +++$+++ 2000s
Ten bucks? Say, if I had ten bucks, I'd quit. +++$+++ 1930s
Well, if you had to do it, you had to do it. What we don't want is that bitch surviving on us. Anybody but that woman. +++$+++ 1990s
I have. Or there would be twice as many. +++$+++ 1990s
They're around. +++$+++ 1990s
I've got to hand it to the British, David. You know what those guys are?  Decent.  Tell me, Herr Dr. Furtwängler, do you know Hans Hinkel? +++$+++ 2000s
Jeez. And you think the British'll share it with their Allies? +++$+++ 2000s
Nicolet and Dargus stop me at the airport and mark the bills. +++$+++ 1990s
Rowan Mayfair. +++$+++ 1990s
Following me? +++$+++ 1990s
From over the mountain -- +++$+++ 2000s
Yes. +++$+++ 1930s
So you feel like you're stuck on a train you can't get off 'cause you're marryin' this fella. +++$+++ 1990s
I feel like I'm spying on Rick. +++$+++ 1980s
It is a hard decision to make -- but yours is only a technical responsibility... +++$+++ 1940s
I've got a lock!  There! +++$+++ 1990s
Dick Wilson? Dickie Wilson? Dickie Wilson runs this place? That's a laugh! +++$+++ 1980s
The match! +++$+++ 1990s
Is he a friend, then? +++$+++ 1980s
What do I know about Williams? +++$+++ 1940s
It would not be the same without you. +++$+++ 2000s
No. +++$+++ 1970s
It's been awhile. She didn't want me looking for my dad. +++$+++ 1990s
Lighten up Adam. Show some character. +++$+++ 1990s
I can't convince him. He's got such a thick head, I'd like to crack it open myself. Believe me, my own brother. It's very hard. You don't have to convince me -- I know we should be with Tommy. You talk to him. He don't listen to nobody. +++$+++ 1980s
Yeah. +++$+++ 1970s
Well, there are certain sections of New York, Major, that I wouldn't advise you to try to invade. +++$+++ 1940s
Oh my God! +++$+++ 2000s
Now, the Old Lady starts to <u>Weep</u>, Big Bird shrugs off his secret <u>Service</u>, goes to her, and covers her with his own coat. +++$+++ 1990s
The hatchery, in particular?  You know my initial yields had to be low, far less than one percent, that's a thousand embryos for every single live birth.  Genetic engineering on that scale implies a giant operation, not the spotless little laboratory I showed you. +++$+++ 1990s
I suppose this is going to sound absurd. I've only known you twenty-four hours, but I'm in love with you. +++$+++ 1930s
I didn't mean you. But just ordinary people. A guy I know -- Dough-Boy -- met his wife that way. They got to talking. She said she usually caught the bus so he started picking her up at the bus stop, taking her home with the flag up. +++$+++ 1970s
I got it.  And I took pictures of the new church for you, too. +++$+++ 1980s
Okay, thanks.  Um... you know, that's it. I'm sorry. +++$+++ 1990s
Kip… I - +++$+++ 1990s
What you're telling me is that I'm dead. Right? +++$+++ 1980s
...tunnel! +++$+++ 1990s
Of God. +++$+++ 1980s
Joey... +++$+++ 1990s
Childs. +++$+++ 2000s
Certainly, sir. How else can I keep my reputation as a miracle worker? +++$+++ 1980s
For what? +++$+++ 1990s
I'm going to go ahead and go now. +++$+++ 2000s
I was so scared. +++$+++ 1950s
Quintus will tell the army that you are being called to Rome to celebrate your victory.  They will hear that you are living in luxury. He will let them feel you have betrayed them for the good life. And soon the army won't even remember your name. +++$+++ 2000s
I thought I'd wait for you. +++$+++ 1980s
He calls it the Tarantula. +++$+++ 1990s
Which means -- +++$+++ 1990s
Lloyd, I love you, okay? +++$+++ 1980s
No, no.  It's fine. +++$+++ 2000s
Check. +++$+++ 1990s
She hasn't one into specifics yet, she's been waiting for you. +++$+++ 1990s
I try to moisturize regularly. +++$+++ 2000s
Look, I have to go. I have to think. +++$+++ 2000s
Who? Donnie and Marie? +++$+++ 1980s
That would take weeks. +++$+++ 2000s
A jogger, huh? +++$+++ 1990s
The man has friends. And they're not likely to forgive me if I testify against him. +++$+++ 1990s
Yeah.  Is that funny? +++$+++ 1990s
Ever go to church? +++$+++ 1980s
Well, you're perfect now. +++$+++ 1930s
What do we do with the Humvee? +++$+++ 1990s
Do I? Keaton was under indictment a total                 + of seven times when he was on the force.                  + In every case, witnesses either reversed                  + their testimony to the grand jury or died                 + before they could testify. When they                      t finally did nail him for fraud, he spent                  + five years in Sing Sing. He killed three prisoners inside - one with a knife in the tailbone while he strangled him to death. Of course I can't prove this but I can't prove the best part either. +++$+++ 1990s
Please, get on the bus... +++$+++ 1990s
Lost something? +++$+++ 1990s
I can't talk to you, you met my wife, I... +++$+++ 1990s
Why in the world would she t... +++$+++ 1990s
Where do you meet? +++$+++ 1980s
Why? +++$+++ 2000s
Man, can you scream. +++$+++ 1990s
No. +++$+++ 1930s
Because it's in English? +++$+++ 2000s
The usual, Barry. +++$+++ 1990s
You'd have to ask them. +++$+++ 1990s
That'll happen when you're about to spend thirty billion dollars on some aspirin... +++$+++ 2000s
Not padded ones. +++$+++ 1990s
It was for your own good, in a twisted sort of publicly humiliating way. +++$+++ 2000s
All right, I have detonation time at... Wait a minute, something's wrong with the clock.  All right, I have detonation time at... no, that can't be right, it says three years.  Okay, I have six minutes exactly. Does that check out down there? +++$+++ 1970s
Every mornin', every night I pass by -- I smile. I say jokes. Nothin'. She looks at me. +++$+++ 1970s
Oh, now, that's a great one! +++$+++ 1990s
What about the other night. What about last night?  Was that to get to know your character? +++$+++ 1990s
Yes. They pick fruit, all kinds. They travel up and down the coast with the seasons.  The trick to Mr. Rose is, you have to let him be the boss. +++$+++ 1990s
Looking back... I suppose it was. I didn't quite realize it at the time but... +++$+++ 2000s
At the store. You doin' some good? +++$+++ 1980s
You look... better. +++$+++ 1980s
Do you remember what just happened? +++$+++ 1980s
Well, no, look... I mean, there was a footprint. Forget it. It's probably not important at all.  You know, I got a job now. I'm teaching high school. Japanese and Chemistry.  So, what were you calling about? +++$+++ 1990s
What do you want me to say? +++$+++ 1990s
What magic have we on our side? +++$+++ 1980s
Well, I got it all planned... and I'm taking Holly off with me. +++$+++ 1970s
Jack Crawford sent a trainee to me? +++$+++ 1990s
No. We're going to lock this up and -- +++$+++ 1990s
Ehhh, you know those guys.  If he had his way, I'd be stuck in the hospital, running tests all day.  And anyway, I've found a new guy who's gonna be able to instantly remove the cancer. +++$+++ 1990s
Yes...<i>yes</i>... +++$+++ 1990s
I've got goose-bumps all over me. +++$+++ 1990s
Can't tell -- these weather conditions could erode anything, fast. +++$+++ 1970s
So you washed it off! +++$+++ 1930s
Twenty-two; same as us. +++$+++ 1990s
In seven years Jackie's never missed one of Tucker's parties. Where is she? +++$+++ 1990s
<u>Yes</u>, I'm sure. +++$+++ 1990s
Yes. +++$+++ 2000s
No one's forcing her. +++$+++ 2000s
Where have you been?!! +++$+++ 2000s
OK, Boss. +++$+++ 2000s
Well, at least I know what to name him.  I don't suppose you'd know who the father is? So I don't tell him to get lost when I meet him. +++$+++ 1980s
Yes, of course you are.  Well, Otho had an intuition.  Call it a hunch -- that it was going to be a fabled monstrosity of a house.  And it certainly is.  Charles, you're lucky the Yuppies are buying condos, so you can afford what I'm going to have to do to this place. We are talking <u>from the ground</u> <u>ups'ville</u>! +++$+++ 1980s
Yeah. +++$+++ 1990s
When you've got money, you'll pay. +++$+++ 1960s
You quitting? +++$+++ 2000s
He would not have spoken of it openly. +++$+++ 1980s
Gentlemen, the prosecution rests. +++$+++ 2000s
You're sick. You should go to the nurse. I'm going to tell Miss Dennis. +++$+++ 1980s
Oh, come off it, man. +++$+++ 1970s

What's the matter, Leo?  Don't you like Coney Island? +++$+++ 1960s

My lawyer?  Why do I need a lawyer? +++$+++ 1990s
What's up? +++$+++ 1930s

Nudie pictures, what do you think? +++$+++ 1990s
Burn??  Are you kidding?  It's freezing! +++$+++ 1980s

I wanted to congratulate you for the job you did on Mr. Lounds. I admired it enormously. What a cunning boy you are, Will. +++$+++ 1980s
With what? +++$+++ 2000s
You don't look so good.  You don't smell so good either. +++$+++ 1980s
I guess that's for the best. +++$+++ 1990s

No. +++$+++ 1920s
An accident at the mill? +++$+++ 1940s

It's on the table where I left it! What the hell are you doing?! Hurry up! +++$+++ 2000s

Any particular reason? +++$+++ 2000s
So, it is a blacklist. +++$+++ 2000s
A drink? I've got some nice gin. If you'd prefer something else, they'll send it up... +++$+++ 1960s
I don't understand. +++$+++ 1990s
Look, Harry's not part of this. He's just a sales rep. +++$+++ 1990s

Yah, that can happen. +++$+++ 1990s
Near Alexandria. It isn't in Alexandria, it is outside it. +++$+++ 1990s
Are you all right? +++$+++ 1960s
Pleasure is for those who seize it! Do you think those insipid, pale- skinned mortals will ever know such rapture? +++$+++ 1980s
Jesus.  About twelve more yards.  Keep coming just like that. +++$+++ 1990s
Why are you doing this to me? +++$+++ 1990s
--yeah, a hand or something-- +++$+++ 2000s
Mr. Streiger, speaking frankly -- we've appreciated the Sergeant's interest you know, all along. Here, locally. But New York, that's - well -- +++$+++ 1970s

Good evening, Mr. Newberry. +++$+++ 1990s

Jessica shifts, Paul sees it, and just as Stilgar begins a reach for his weapon, Jessica turns, slashes out, utters a SOUND, whirls again and with rock behind her holds Stilgar helpless in front of her -- her hand at his throat. Paul moves on her first move.  He races up a rocky incline. +++$+++ 1980s
Now, Wendell, did you inquire about the cylinder lock? +++$+++ 2000s
Try the desk. +++$+++ 1950s

Bloke told me. +++$+++ 1990s
Watch the first step. +++$+++ 1940s

Want me to breathe deeply? +++$+++ 1970s
I think you're trying to tell me something. +++$+++ 2000s
Oh! Madam is cancelling the engagement. Madam has chosen a funny time for such a funny joke. Ha, ha, ha -- hurry, come on. Tonight -- there's a line in front of the theatre since six o'clock. The house is jammed to the roof. +++$+++ 1930s
Newcomers working near methane gasses at oil refineries must paint it on their boots to protect against sparks. +++$+++ 1980s
The question is, does Brad want to see you?  Quite frankly, he hates you. +++$+++ 1980s
Yes, if you like.  Call me at work. +++$+++ 1980s
Yeah, I read your piece. It's very smart. And very wrong. +++$+++ 2000s
There was a break-in. +++$+++ 1990s
A fuckin' pink robe and a fuckin'... +++$+++ 1990s
Captain Miller, I just want to say... +++$+++ 1990s
Bruckner's Seventh. The Adagio. +++$+++ 2000s
You should have tried to get pregnant Marylin -- solidify your position. +++$+++ 2000s
Of course not!  And how is it you were nearby? +++$+++ 1970s
That's nice. +++$+++ 1950s
Might be, shit. Man, I know this town. I got my own fences. Who the hell are you? Who put you in charge? +++$+++ 1990s
Why? +++$+++ 1970s
Yeah, I'm sure. +++$+++ 1990s
Can't we hold him? +++$+++ 1990s
You've been waiting your chance. You're too much of a gentleman -- that's the trouble with you. +++$+++ 1930s
Sure, Paul.  No hard feelings. +++$+++ 1990s
Doesnit sleep? +++$+++ 2000s
Yes.  The bulldog's just gone to press. +++$+++ 1940s
Oh, my God. +++$+++ 1990s
I love it! +++$+++ 2000s
Please, Barton. +++$+++ 1990s
Like what? +++$+++ 1960s
True. +++$+++ 1990s
Good luck. +++$+++ 1980s
Are you going to see him? +++$+++ 1930s
Push and twist, it's child proof. +++$+++ 2000s
Helen. +++$+++ 1990s
No. I meant not to be angry with you, Sir Gahalt. In the idleness that comes with peace gossip has bread its own evil. You merely repeat it. Please, sir, have one of those apples that Lancelot loves, and in that gesture partake of its goodness. +++$+++ 1980s
Well, I can, and I love it! He forgets the office when he's with me. He doesn't treat me like an errand-boy -- he treats me like a woman. +++$+++ 1940s
What're you gonna get out of it, huh? +++$+++ 1960s
Certainly not mine. Come on. +++$+++ 1990s
Wheelchair accessible. +++$+++ 1990s
Yeah, I think he is.  Hey, Fred! +++$+++ 1980s
The bourbon.  The news about Ugarte upset me very much. +++$+++ 1940s
Wherever you like, Lutece, 21, the River Cafe...or maybe we can just drive around for a while.  Work up an appetite. +++$+++ 1980s
I miss those days, when schoolyard sexual harassment was without consequence. +++$+++ 2000s
Kick a buck. +++$+++ 1960s
Lovely. +++$+++ 2000s
Skipper, you can't do this! +++$+++ 1980s
You have a little boy.  He shows you his butterfly collection, plus the killing jar. +++$+++ 1980s
Thank you, sir. +++$+++ 1960s
I'm in love with your daughter, and I'm taking her with me tonight. +++$+++ 1990s
Thank you. +++$+++ 1940s
But there's no -- +++$+++ 1990s
Thanks. +++$+++ 1980s
It was pale...a shadowed gold. +++$+++ 1940s
Over there! +++$+++ 1950s
Then I called his house, and his mother told me he was in the garage helping his father. +++$+++ 1980s
Hey, by the way, I'm really sorry about your wife leavin' you. +++$+++ 2000s
It's their Presidential Suite. +++$+++ 1990s
Why, that's ridiculous! I was on that bus—I told them to wait! +++$+++ 1930s
Let's knock off early. Go to the mall. Something lame like that. +++$+++ 1980s
If you'll just maybe ease it into second. +++$+++ 1980s
Seeya tomorrow. +++$+++ 1990s
That was Marvin Untermeyer. +++$+++ 2000s
"Accident and Compensation" -- no one can accuse the firm of not supplying exactly what it promises. +++$+++ 1990s
I think we should go. +++$+++ 2000s
Put it on. +++$+++ 2000s
I want Reiben on B.A.R; Jackson with his sniper rifle; Beasley, demolition. +++$+++ 1990s
Then why? +++$+++ 1990s
They must be shielded somehow.  I'm sure the base is there. +++$+++ 1970s
Man's in town two days, thinks he's David O. fucking Selznick. +++$+++ 1990s
It's no big deal, right? +++$+++ 1990s
What happened? +++$+++ 2000s
Thank you for correcting my ignorance.  I'm looking forward to working side by side with you.  I feel we make a good team. +++$+++ 2000s
No, don't say anything else! +++$+++ 1980s
You plan on shooting that gun or just hugging it? +++$+++ 2000s
I'm not going. +++$+++ 1980s
How's that about your being my friend? +++$+++ 1950s
Somethin' like that. +++$+++ 2000s
You been to Japan? +++$+++ 1990s
You... fed on me? +++$+++ 1990s
Maybe you should back off. +++$+++ 2000s
Entertain yourself. +++$+++ 1980s
Sure.  But that's only when the love itself goes unchanged. +++$+++ 1980s
We object, Your Honor. It would unfairly influence the jury. +++$+++ 1990s
What's the matter? +++$+++ 2000s
That's even better. +++$+++ 1930s
Yeah. +++$+++ 1980s
Come on in. You wanna Ginseng Cooler? +++$+++ 2000s
Sorry, Stu. It's all part of the deal. We've got <u>big plans</u> for that body of yours! +++$+++ 2000s
And only then does our noble friend realize... +++$+++ 1990s
I don't trust anyone.  That's what comes of working in television. +++$+++ 1980s
Do guys actually believe their lame, self- serving excuses? +++$+++ 1990s
Yah. Yah. Home a Paul Bunyan and Babe the Blue Ox. +++$+++ 1990s
Funny, nobody calls it that anymore. Caesar calls it "The |Business." +++$+++ 1990s
She said they were from her old convent. +++$+++ 1990s
What the fuck are you doing? +++$+++ 1990s
No. I - I'm just curious, you know. I was wonderin' how much he would put into a thing like that. That's all. +++$+++ 1990s
-- Looks like a clear shot to the 'Bama State Line. +++$+++ 1970s
Now you're being rude, Shorty. +++$+++ 2000s
Sounds good. +++$+++ 1990s
Where's your elastic brace? +++$+++ 2000s
This whole place can't be wired to just one circuit -- +++$+++ 1990s
I'm so happy you like it.  I'm so relieved you said yes, and I'm really, um, what, thrilled, yes actually, to finally meet you. +++$+++ 2000s
Is it? +++$+++ 2000s
I just wanted to distract them. I wasn't trying to get a picture of you. +++$+++ 1980s
The radio rig is inside.  It runs directly from the geothermal generator, so power shouldn't be a problem. +++$+++ 1990s
They'll wait.  Meantime, raise the lid. +++$+++ 2000s
Duffy, go over and sit on Mulvihill.  Jesus Christ, I didn't tell you to bring the police department with you. +++$+++ 1970s
Try? +++$+++ 2000s
There's somebody lookin' for me. Not police. Just call me if anyone else checks in tonight. +++$+++ 2000s
<u>It's uncanny</u>. +++$+++ 1990s
Don't make my mistake, kid... don't...be a grunt...your whole life... +++$+++ 1990s
Met him through Santos... Clyde - your daddy - had some sorta business deal with Santos. +++$+++ 1990s
Very good. Now we play ROUND 2. +++$+++ 2000s
What was it? +++$+++ 1960s
So you did talk about it, huh? +++$+++ 1990s
Listen: when we get back tomorrow, you're gonna find Tully laying a promotion on you. S.A.C. He wants to prove that his yuppie agents are making good. He's offering you New York. Tell him you want Atlanta. +++$+++ 1990s
I'm not crazy. +++$+++ 1990s
Give it to him. +++$+++ 1990s
off the peg? +++$+++ 1990s
You will therefore be taken to the Dune Sea and cast into the pit of Carkoon, the nesting place of the all-powerful Sarlacc. +++$+++ 1980s
No question, no, you're right. We gotta do what's good for us now. +++$+++ 2000s
No. Just like an hour or so. +++$+++ 1990s
I know. Stop it. +++$+++ 2000s
By the way, you're getting a hell of a car there, mister. +++$+++ 1970s
You sure about this? +++$+++ 2000s
Because you were spoiled, don't try to spoil Sunny. +++$+++ 1990s
Well, there's a message on his answering machine saying he went to London. +++$+++ 2000s
Who are you? +++$+++ 2000s
That's not the reason. I've got a date at six thirty. +++$+++ 1990s
Thanks, Kitty, I'll never forget you for th-- +++$+++ 2000s
I hope you're not comparing yourself to Napoleon. He was a strategist. Your idea of strategy is to use a lead pipe. +++$+++ 1930s
What are we going to say? +++$+++ 1990s
Wait a minute. Do you mean... don't tell me you... in front of him. +++$+++ 1980s
No! +++$+++ 2000s
Just getting my facts straight. Twenty-two makes it a gas chamber bounce. You should have pulled this caper a couple of years ago.  Get life, do a little Youth Authority jolt, transfer to Folsom a big man. Orbit on some of that good prison brew, get yourself a sissy -- +++$+++ 1990s
I won't be needing these anymore. +++$+++ 1980s
I don't know. I was just thinking the same thing. +++$+++ 1990s
I don't think so, sir. +++$+++ 1960s
And you think the movie business is any different? +++$+++ 1990s
Where did you learn to fight like that? JIM  I read a book. +++$+++ 2000s
We've got to get Cathy. +++$+++ 1960s
Yes, of course you remember it, but what you are remembering is merely a series of electrical impulses which you now realize have no necessary connection with outside reality. +++$+++ 1970s
Yessir. I understand that. +++$+++ 2000s
Chili Palmer showed you my script? +++$+++ 1990s
Caesar, you just killed Gino Marzzone. +++$+++ 1990s
Set down sixty meters this side of the telemetry mast.  Immediate dust off on my 'clear,' then stay on station. +++$+++ 1980s
Fourteen, Harry. +++$+++ 1990s
Just trying to get my apartment in order. +++$+++ 1980s
What are we doing here? +++$+++ 1970s
OK, I bite. What does it look like? +++$+++ 1970s
No way we can outrun 'em together. Move it! +++$+++ 1990s
It may be extraterrestrial. +++$+++ 1990s
Yeah, you too, Tracy.  I'm just glad it's over. +++$+++ 1990s
I lie to everybody, what makes you so special? +++$+++ 1990s
Those blood suckers. How I'd love to fix those babies but— +++$+++ 1950s
I think I'll stick around. I'll leave with the porters on their next trip. +++$+++ 1930s
Yeah. Come on—we're stopping here for the night. +++$+++ 1930s
My daddy always said when a man starts talking about the weather keep you hand on your wallet. +++$+++ 2000s
Put you in touch with Grimsrud. +++$+++ 1990s
California. +++$+++ 1990s
That's I.A.'s pit bull. +++$+++ 2000s
Seriously. +++$+++ 2000s
But then I would've missed the pleasure of your company. +++$+++ 1990s
Talk to him. +++$+++ 1980s
No.  I think I said something eloquent like, "So, uh -- maybe we should, ya know.  What do you think?" +++$+++ 1990s
I don't understand.  Do you want my autograph? +++$+++ 1990s
Figlio di puttana. You’re the French asshole who bumped off the London guys... +++$+++ 1990s
What? Who? +++$+++ 1930s
Al! +++$+++ 1990s
Talk? About me--about us? +++$+++ 1930s
Yeah, they hit the calf over the head with a mallet and then Luisa hits it again in the kitchen. +++$+++ 1990s
Alright.  Let me play this record while I go to work on my chicken Parmigiana hero with extra cheese and extra sauce. +++$+++ 1980s
He, I'm Mona. +++$+++ 2000s
See these?  Found them in the box with the cards.  These are stock certificates.  IBM.  AT&T.  Polaroid. +++$+++ 1990s
May I ask where you’re from, Mr Lamont? +++$+++ 1990s
I mean, that's what worried me, 'cause it turns out Nicky was about to be sent to Vegas. +++$+++ 1990s
Hope I'm not interrupting...? +++$+++ 1980s
I told you the questions might get a little personal -- +++$+++ 2000s
I don't want you to think that I'm a drinker. I can stop any time I want to - only I don't want to.  Especially when I'm blue. +++$+++ 1950s
Do you?  Then why don't you go out? Meet someone.  Make a life for yourself instead of hiding away in the past? +++$+++ 1990s
What? +++$+++ 2000s
No, I can't.  I'm sorry and all, but... +++$+++ 1990s
It's not the kind of thing you do. +++$+++ 1990s
I don't know. +++$+++ 2000s
Jim, don't.  You're scaring him. +++$+++ 1990s
I had him! +++$+++ 2000s
Wendy! +++$+++ 1990s
Susie, I want to help you--, there's nothing I won't do for you. You're all I've got in the whole, wide world. +++$+++ 1950s
Hey!  What are you trying to do?  Get yourself committed? +++$+++ 1980s
No way. +++$+++ 1990s
Look on it like a honeymoon. +++$+++ 1990s
You knew them?  Who were they, Sister? Who are these boys? What are the names of these -- good boys you knew? +++$+++ 1990s
Damned hunters.  It was a trap, and you were the bait! +++$+++ 1980s
Yeah!  YEAH!!!  Man I'm getting so HOT!!! +++$+++ 1990s
You did well... +++$+++ 2000s
What happened to me? +++$+++ 1990s
We'll never find the Baron's castle. +++$+++ 1980s
Well ... what's the matter with that? +++$+++ 1960s
He's a house-afire! +++$+++ 1930s
Mrs. Brigman, you're becoming a serious impediment to this mission.  I believe the stress is affecting you.  Escort her to quarters and have Monk prepare a tranquilizer. +++$+++ 1980s
It's her home! It's where she lives!! +++$+++ 1990s
Don't you feel that is a simplistic retort? +++$+++ 2000s
Oh! I'll pop them in a bowl. +++$+++ 1990s
Jesus Christ, Sid! Is everything your responsibility? +++$+++ 1980s
Who the fuck are you? +++$+++ 2000s
One more. Smile. One more. +++$+++ 2000s
Oh, do you? +++$+++ 2000s
Oh, we didn't build it.  The transit system has been in place for billions of years; we're just its... caretakers. +++$+++ 1990s
That only proves my point more. The word is a badge for her failures at school. +++$+++ 1980s
My instinct was to not get electrocuted. +++$+++ 1990s
The good stuff.  Can you handle that? +++$+++ 2000s
Sorry.  It's just...a strange woman waltzes into my office today.  Tells me she murdered her parents and can prove Satan exists. +++$+++ 2000s
I got it. +++$+++ 1990s
Well, Mister President. +++$+++ 1960s
I have a pretty good idea. Ordell ain't no bootlegger and I doubt he's smugglin' Cuban cigars. So that only leaves one thing an A.T.F. man would be interested in. +++$+++ 1990s
All right, Major.  I'm putting the base on condition Red. +++$+++ 1960s
Little girl. Maybe five years old? +++$+++ 1990s
A small thing.  Nothing really. +++$+++ 2000s
Yessir. +++$+++ 2000s
If she does it'll be a miracle outa Scripture. +++$+++ 1940s
What does that fucking mean? +++$+++ 1990s
Oh, right.  Alright. +++$+++ 2000s
I'm here about some monkeys. +++$+++ 1990s
He ain't dead? You didn't get him? +++$+++ 1990s
Okay, billion...right, of course. They told me I could have any producer I wanted -- and I want you. +++$+++ 1980s
I’m compulsive and weird? +++$+++ 2000s
I couldn't see much in the dark - but it was one! +++$+++ 1950s
What's this? +++$+++ 1990s
I've got some more clothes for you-- I just keep forgetting to bring them with me. +++$+++ 1990s
We're going down into the sewer system to see if we can trace the source of the psycho-reactive slime flow.  We thought you might want to come along. +++$+++ 1980s
He's not that old yet.  You've lost confidence in me. +++$+++ 1990s
When he was about seventeen, he startin' losin' his hair. +++$+++ 1990s
May I use your telephone? +++$+++ 1930s
I feel...isolated.  Different.  I've got abandonment issues.  My father flew away when I was just a larva. My mother didn't have much time for me...when you have five million siblings, it's difficult to get attention.  I feel physically inadequate -- I've never been able to lift more than ten times my own weight.  Sometimes I think I'm just not cut out to be a worker.  But I don't have any other options.  I was assigned to trade school when I was just a <u>grub</u>.  The whole system just...makes me feel...<u>insignificant</u>. +++$+++ 1990s
You were screaming like crazy. +++$+++ 1980s
Why didn't she put'em out? +++$+++ 2000s
Guard barracks.  Take some shots. +++$+++ 1980s
He strained his leg so that it pains him to ride. But he sends his greetings -- and says that I speak for all the Bruces. And for Scotland. +++$+++ 1990s
My Aunt Bella, sweet woman not the brightest bat in the world - she used to hang right side up, anyway she always said "Curses were made to be broken". Course, she said it in those irritating little bat squeaks, so it wasn't quite so profound... +++$+++ 1990s
Got to talk to the brothers. +++$+++ 1950s
That's not the purpose of this mission.  Captain -- keep a straight course -- until you're in the clear. +++$+++ 1960s
I did you a favor by standing up for you last night, but don't think we're friends. I'm sorry, but I have other things - +++$+++ 1990s
C'mon, Beth.  Don't make this personal.  He told me himself they were taking us back. +++$+++ 1990s
With all due respect, Your Honor... We don't live in this courtroom, do we? +++$+++ 1990s
No -- she asked me about cocaine. +++$+++ 1990s
You certainly do. +++$+++ 1990s
He's not strong enough to fight off another attack. +++$+++ 2000s
You've got a big mouth, and now I'm going to show you an even bigger one. +++$+++ 1990s
Oh.  That was just one of those idle questions.  One doesn't expect an answer. +++$+++ 1990s
I'll tell you what, Barbara.  I don't think we survived that crash. +++$+++ 1980s
No, the Mediocre Mantini. Of course the Great Mantini! +++$+++ 1990s
Well, we was. Like you said, I changed my mind an'... +++$+++ 1990s
Huh huh huh. That was cool. +++$+++ 1990s
You think I'm staying? +++$+++ 1990s
To Mexico... +++$+++ 1970s
I don't think I'll persuade you. You'll do it or you won't. Dr. Bloom is working an it anyway, and he's the best... +++$+++ 1980s
That's not ENTIRELY true. +++$+++ 2000s
Soggy Bottom Boys - I don't precisely recollect, uh - +++$+++ 2000s
Thou. For Thou art with me.  Welcome, welcome, welcome! +++$+++ 1970s
I think by Twenty-two. +++$+++ 2000s
Okay. +++$+++ 2000s
Yeah. Something slippery all over here...  Tina? +++$+++ 1980s
Get it while you're young.  And you better fix your lips.  You want to look nice for Osgood, don't you? +++$+++ 1950s
Really. You want to dance with someone else? +++$+++ 1980s
Jean? Sorbet? +++$+++ 2000s
Garry's missing! +++$+++ 1980s
C'mon. +++$+++ 1990s
And? +++$+++ 1980s
I dare you. Stab my flesh. Which one of us will bleed? +++$+++ 2000s
You want me to walk you? +++$+++ 1980s
Aw, come on Jerry. We've gotten all we're gonna get out of this place and its starting to rain. +++$+++ 2000s
See and raise five. +++$+++ 1970s
You are being typically theatrical, Marion. I need the Tribune to-- +++$+++ 1990s
Well, wait and see. +++$+++ 1940s
What did he look like? +++$+++ 2000s
What'd it say? +++$+++ 1980s
I will not do it.  You'll have to get somebody else, because I will not. +++$+++ 1990s
Fine. Mrs. Buckley will be all right when she gets used to the idea. +++$+++ 1980s
Chloe? +++$+++ 2000s
Guess who? +++$+++ 1980s
Only that floor. +++$+++ 1990s
The core could be hardwired to overload without much effort. +++$+++ 1990s
What if he asks where I got the money? +++$+++ 1980s
You think he'll find us. +++$+++ 1980s
I heard the same sound at Ladysmith, at Nukden, Port Arthur.  What do you expect after a battle? +++$+++ 1940s
It's okay.  Edward told me.  Your secret's safe with me. +++$+++ 1990s
Your father loved me.  He wanted to marry me. But he was afraid of hurting the gentle, delicate Cathy. You spoiled his life ——you've ruined mine —— +++$+++ 1940s
Get up from there. I don't want anybody holding the ends of my pants. Get up from there! +++$+++ 1930s
Justin just tried to kill himself. The man is clearly insane. +++$+++ 1990s
What're we looking for? +++$+++ 2000s
On your piano, that is the swap. +++$+++ 1990s
Alright Willie, I think I got everything. I'll talk to Dillard, see if I can get up to the infirmary and check up on you. Make sure they're changing your diapers regular. +++$+++ 2000s
You're not joking. +++$+++ 2000s
You're very protective of him, Randal. You always have been. +++$+++ 1990s
I still don't get why you're trying to break into the system. +++$+++ 1980s
Dear Veronica, Heather was your soulmate.....Share. +++$+++ 1980s
No!  The only hope now is to get him back here.  If I can just find a way to relieve the pressure on his cerebellum... +++$+++ 1970s
What are you doing? +++$+++ 2000s
They'll mend. +++$+++ 1980s
I know you miss your parents, its hasn't been that long. +++$+++ 1980s
Can you believe she fuckin' bit me? +++$+++ 1980s
You'll never do it! You can't do it! +++$+++ 1930s
Alright. All right, all right, so whatta you wanna do? +++$+++ 1970s
I'm thinking that if the black Book Of The Dead can bring people back to life -- +++$+++ 1990s
Yeah, ya should've come along with us, Miss Ratched, an' gotten a little sun on your cheeks and maybe caught a fish or two. +++$+++ 1970s
My name is Lorl, sir. I'm a maidservant. I was asked to come here and offer my services to you. +++$+++ 1980s
Look, even if it was nearer, that's just not what I do. I give clinics. And I'm not even doing them for a while. I'm heading back to Montana right now. I got a ranch to take care of... +++$+++ 1990s
I think we should get something straight here. I was assigned to this office by the city. +++$+++ 1990s
What is so incredibly great about New York? It's a dying city! You-you read "Death in Venice". +++$+++ 1970s
Of course. Sorry. I'm such a fucking asshole. +++$+++ 2000s
No -- I'm afraid not. +++$+++ 2000s
So you're still on the Zoloft? +++$+++ 2000s
+ The nose is sharper. Smaller too.                          +  &lt;&lt;And what about the hair? You said something earlier about it.&gt;&gt; +++$+++ 1990s
Yes. +++$+++ 2000s
Norstars. +++$+++ 1990s
Do you practice here? +++$+++ 1960s
Someone named Hockley, I should imagine. +++$+++ 1990s
Not really. +++$+++ 1990s
Why do you think he does that, Gerry? +++$+++ 1990s
What? +++$+++ 1980s
What'd you do? +++$+++ 1990s
He means the last that we know of. +++$+++ 1980s
I hope so. +++$+++ 2000s
Let's just say he burned me once. +++$+++ 2000s
Just one year. +++$+++ 1980s
Sure she is. That's why she got an unlisted number and you haven't heard squat from her in a dozen years. Oh you're good, Ted. You're a real piece of work. +++$+++ 1990s
Not me.  I'm in for the long haul. In nine months I'll have enough to take a few years off. +++$+++ 1990s
I'm not sure. +++$+++ 1990s
When you get a chance. +++$+++ 1990s
You put up with me, because I can read and write ancient Egyptian, decipher hieroglyphs and hieratic, and I'm the only person within a thousand miles who knows how to properly code and catalogue this library. +++$+++ 1990s
Look, I can't run your arrest in CNN, but I guarantee he's monitoring every law enforcement agency in the world, for what they might be saying about him, if nothing else - he's got the ability and, we assume, the desire to get you out of there. +++$+++ 2000s
Remember when I went to Italy and canceled the policy on the new stadium.  Well, we weren't being cheated by the Mafia or anybody except maybe by me...  ... Do they come for lunch everyday? I really went on my own business, to see a man that I happen to be in love with... and I'm glad I did it, but I'm sorry about the policy and I'll be happy to make up the money the company didn't get... of course just now I don't have...  One million, four hundred and ten thousand dollars.  But if you were to dock my salary, say, twenty dollars a week, in a few hundred years we'd be even... and I think this is where you fire me? +++$+++ 1980s
Have to hope it's a signal that he'll back down on the real issue too. +++$+++ 2000s
You want to make it like this? +++$+++ 1970s
Don't never write nothing down. File it up here, like I do.  'Cause if they can't find no paper they ain't got no proof. Ya dig? +++$+++ 1990s
No, private, I want you to stay here, keep your head down, don't do anything brave or stupid. +++$+++ 1990s
The Conformist. +++$+++ 2000s
Hey, that's great, Henry! Good thinking! +++$+++ 1970s
Won't get it.  We are a sacrifice.  A diversion. +++$+++ 1980s
Drunk, sir? +++$+++ 1930s
How's the spying tonight, guys? +++$+++ 1990s
What teacher? +++$+++ 1950s
Don't you think I stand out like this. +++$+++ 1980s
Lieutenant Doolittle, this is Talby. Lieutenant? +++$+++ 1970s
That thing about I was the most, you know, beautiful person you had ever known.  What was that? +++$+++ 2000s
Imposserous! +++$+++ 1930s
Yes, I think so. He adores her, it's almost pitiful the way he worships her. I just hope she isn't too much for him. +++$+++ 1990s
Yes, ma'am, it is. +++$+++ 1990s
I'm going aboard. Spock, you have the conn. +++$+++ 1990s
Either way, maybe there's a book in it, and they both make a ton of money. +++$+++ 2000s
You must know your third grade geography book inside out. +++$+++ 1960s
You are going to drive to the frontier. +++$+++ 1970s
I've already got a team there. I doubt Bourne's in Naples to settle down and raise a family. +++$+++ 2000s
Give it to me! +++$+++ 1990s
I got released. +++$+++ 1980s
What a creep. +++$+++ 1990s
Daddy wouldn't hear that. Now the redhaired boy you see sitting there, of course you have met him, he is my oldest son and my most brilliant child. All children have great creative powers, but I don't want to rattle on about my children, they say I brag too much about them, especially about Brother. Am I boring you, Rose? +++$+++ 1990s
Yeah. +++$+++ 1930s
The man following me has a walkie- talkie. If he sees I'm not here he'll call his partner. I do anything out of line and he'll send the word to kill my daughter. +++$+++ 1990s
Alex. +++$+++ 1970s
Why? +++$+++ 1950s
Could we have a word? +++$+++ 1990s
But, but but but... +++$+++ 2000s
Something. Someone. +++$+++ 2000s
So why did you come back here, Sam? +++$+++ 1990s
Fernando wasn't pissed off at everybody. He just wanted to fix their cars. +++$+++ 1990s
I'm out! I'm out! +++$+++ 1930s
Goose is dead. +++$+++ 1980s
Pride of a job-well-done... +++$+++ 1990s
You haven't heard from him, have you, Dad? +++$+++ 1930s
My dress'll reek. +++$+++ 1990s
Your daddy's still livin' down there from what you told me.  I guess he wouldn't help you any, would he? I wasn't thinking. You don't know anybody? +++$+++ 1990s
Right. CHINA I need a taking care of,  not `hey how bout a pizza after class babe'.  I'm looking  for something just a little more in a man.  A little `je nes se qua'. +++$+++ 1980s
Well, it's rather interesting about Brother, actually. I realized the remarkable thing he had when he was six weeks old. He looked at me and understood me, he knew exactly who I was. I know it sounds crazy but it's true. He's very remarkable, he was born for the ministry and could move millions, but he doesn't know that yet. I have to warn you about him, he can be very dangerous, there is an evil streak in him, a streak of pure sheer meanness. But at heart Brother is saintly and that is why he was born for the ministry even if he doesn't know it. +++$+++ 1990s
Oh. No. Strictly dryland. +++$+++ 1980s
Eh! Love...what a mystery!  I understand you, Toto...The ones with blue eyes are the most beautiful. Whatever you do, you can't make friends with them.  Eh, there's nothing to be done about it! The heavier a man is, the deeper his footprints. And if he's in love, he suffers, because he knows he's up a one-way street. Because love is a meaningless thing when a man gets it into his head to do what he wants... +++$+++ 1980s
Even if money wasn't an issue, Dunwitty will still go ahead without me and that could be more dangerous. +++$+++ 2000s
I don't know -- how would I know? +++$+++ 1960s
Do you like it? +++$+++ 2000s
More, do you hear me? +++$+++ 1970s
Sure, sure, we'd all be millionaires. There's no point in looking back. At the time, Stilson thought dumping our position would panic the market, further depress the stock -- then we'd buy it all back, and more of course, once it got cheap -- +++$+++ 1990s
Where did you learn that word? +++$+++ 2000s
Is that an innuendo, Miss Teschmacher? Because if it is, you are about to experience the heady thrill of being hurled from a moving vehicle. +++$+++ 1970s
Yeah. What's wrong with you guys? Think ahead. We find 'em, sue 'em. We'll make a killing.  We'll have dinner at Chasen's twice a week, we'll be pissing on ice the rest of our lives. +++$+++ 1970s
Why would they do all that if we weren't? +++$+++ 1990s
Yeah, sure... +++$+++ 2000s
And why should continuing excellence cost more? +++$+++ 2000s
Need to lose some weight. +++$+++ 2000s
What'd you guys find? +++$+++ 2000s
Edward T. Dowd. +++$+++ 1980s
Hurry up with those drinks. We're thirsty. Only two rums. Make mine a Bloody Mary. +++$+++ 1990s
I was afraid of that. +++$+++ 1980s
Well you're not reading it right! +++$+++ 1980s
Mikey-- +++$+++ 1990s
There is some good in you, Lex, after all. +++$+++ 1980s
Good evening. I want to stay at this hotel. +++$+++ 1990s
I hope you have patience with me.  I do not know how to dance the quadrille but, if you desire it, I will learn. +++$+++ 1990s
Well forgive me if I don't think of you as the world's safest bet. +++$+++ 2000s
How would you describe him? +++$+++ 2000s
Yes sir. +++$+++ 1960s
I'm stuck here for another couple of hours. +++$+++ 2000s
He was murdered. +++$+++ 1990s
You got a good lawyer? +++$+++ 1990s
Sometimes I think he is fooling us with that crazy business. +++$+++ 1950s
A million deaths are not enough for Yueh... +++$+++ 1980s
Victoria - +++$+++ 1980s
How good is he? +++$+++ 1960s
Hi. +++$+++ 1980s
I can't believe the Captain went along with a memory download. +++$+++ 2000s
Well then, perhaps you also --- +++$+++ 1940s
Okay, whatta I do? +++$+++ 1990s
That doesn't mean you do. You can't possibly trust him, he's... perverted. +++$+++ 1980s
Nice job. +++$+++ 1990s
Go ahead and put the guard back up, Letty. But you need to know what you're dealing with. +++$+++ 2000s
Why? +++$+++ 1950s
Just don't know why I'd be doing it. +++$+++ 1990s
I like football. +++$+++ 1990s
Eve. I - I don't think you meant to cause unhappiness. But you did. More to yourself, perhaps - as it turned out - than to anyone else... +++$+++ 1950s
You should give it to someone with only one leg. +++$+++ 1990s
I think a skin cell’s the more likely of the two. +++$+++ 2000s
I thought Blockbuster fired you. +++$+++ 1990s
No -- leave it -- +++$+++ 1970s
It's all right, Captain.  Proceed. +++$+++ 1980s
I admit it. +++$+++ 1950s
I don't know that Ellie.  He might get out.  Garber's not bein' straight with the witness, she could be in deep shit if she identifies him, and it's my job to convince her she won't be. +++$+++ 1980s
There you are, both of you. Max, Karen has decided it's time to go. +++$+++ 1950s
Boy! +++$+++ 1970s
Aren't you coming back with me? +++$+++ 1970s
I'm sure you'll figure it out. +++$+++ 2000s
Hello, Mr. Leland. +++$+++ 1940s
I got a surprise for you, blondie... +++$+++ 1990s
Mmm. +++$+++ 1990s
I couldn't care less. +++$+++ 1990s
And Jewish men like to get it. +++$+++ 2000s
Don't go playing policeman. +++$+++ 1990s
Donna? +++$+++ 1980s
I must have missed 60 Minutes.  What are you saying? +++$+++ 1980s
Only family allowed, Nancy. You know the drill. +++$+++ 1980s
And what in blazes have the nuns got to do with it? +++$+++ 1950s
Nigger, fuck me hard!!... +++$+++ 2000s
Him no white.  Him no white. +++$+++ 1980s
A little... +++$+++ 1990s
Every time I see something like that, I know we're right to be here- to bring Christianity into their lives, enrich their souls. +++$+++ 1990s
Now Edna says you short-changed your last meds.  You can do presents and be comfortable at the same time, y'know. +++$+++ 1990s
She was with you after she left Frank. +++$+++ 1970s
Well, he certainly isn't acting like it. +++$+++ 1990s
Shouldn't we pay 'em for the damages? +++$+++ 1970s
That's crazy. I'll get you some applications. +++$+++ 1990s
No, no, no: he has yet to achieve mediocrity. +++$+++ 1980s
You've been on your feet for days. And didn't even finish your salad. +++$+++ 1990s
Save it for the powder room babe, this man is in pain +++$+++ 1980s
Where'd they go? +++$+++ 1990s
What I know is that as long as you keep your work zipped up around me, I don't give a fuck what or where you shove your show. Are we being neighbors for now? +++$+++ 1990s
There was ninety-one million - +++$+++ 1990s
Sorry.  If I did, I didn't mean to. +++$+++ 1990s
--I want you to shut up and listen to me-- +++$+++ 1970s
Tell me, damn you. +++$+++ 1980s
I'll get my jacket. +++$+++ 1990s
Who told you to think?!  I don't give you enough information to think!  You do what you're told!!  That's what you do! +++$+++ 1990s
For heaven's sake, Joe—stop being an editor for just a minute.  We've been friends for a long time, haven't we? You ought to know when I'm serious. This is on the level. +++$+++ 1930s
They're <u>somebody's</u> friends...  You drive a cab.  I kill people.  We both do our jobs right, you might survive the night and come out four hundred bucks ahead. +++$+++ 2000s
Voice stress analyzer. +++$+++ 1980s
I've never been so hungry in my life... +++$+++ 1980s
Mr. Thatcher is going to take you on a trip with him tonight, Charles. You'll be leaving on Number Ten. +++$+++ 1940s
No. +++$+++ 1990s
Chase, you'd better come home. +++$+++ 1990s
... Y'know Al, if Hoover was alive none of this would've happened.  He would've protected the President. +++$+++ 1990s
The poor thing.... +++$+++ 1950s
Isn't he the one that always writes about things - only the things he knows about? +++$+++ 1930s
No, you have a press agent do it. +++$+++ 1970s
Well, what'ya do? +++$+++ 1990s
You would be, two, if you'd gone through what he went through. +++$+++ 1990s
Oh brother. Here we go. +++$+++ 2000s
Oh, it'll do in a pinch. +++$+++ 1930s
What are you doing? +++$+++ 2000s
And then they're gonna stamp on it?! +++$+++ 1990s
Not bad...? This guy's Dr. Kildare, the jury's going to love him, Mick... And you calm down, all right? Their guy, Towler's, the author of the book,  'Methodology and Practice, Anesthesiology.'  ...and they got depositions from the nurses, everybody in the operating room, the scrub-nurse... 'All these guys are God. I saw them walk on water...'  They had an obstetrical nurse in there. We got a deposition from the obstetrical nurse? +++$+++ 1980s
Honest, Toby.  I just axed him for a quarter for the jukebox. +++$+++ 1990s
I told you not to hang up on me. +++$+++ 1990s
You really love me, don't you? +++$+++ 1980s
Unless we set Charenton on a straight and narrow course, she'll be shut down forever by order of the Emperor. +++$+++ 2000s
Did you tell them that I flooded the school? +++$+++ 2000s
What do you remember about her. +++$+++ 1990s
Evone tells me:  I shoulda been in, fi, six, months ago.... thizz my first checkup. +++$+++ 2000s
Yet you look so sad. A great man like you should not be sad. +++$+++ 2000s
You're a snake. +++$+++ 1990s
Thank you. +++$+++ 2000s
Everyone is going to the dance. Aren't you ? +++$+++ 1990s
Perhaps the General's glasses can reach to the Hudson and he knows the size and imminence of the army of Webb...? +++$+++ 1970s
Oh, what do they know? +++$+++ 1980s
I know. It's the house you want to wake up in on Christmas morning.  Make yourself at home. I'll be right back. +++$+++ 2000s
Hungry, anyway. +++$+++ 1990s
So, you called me up, because you just wanted to have a drink before you... go find a hotel? +++$+++ 1990s
If my kids and my wife were always at an ex-husband's house, I'd worry. +++$+++ 2000s
Thanks, I see him... +++$+++ 1950s
Who's going to fly our helicopter now? +++$+++ 1970s
Hey, mister. +++$+++ 1960s
Ow, let go, Butt-Head! +++$+++ 1990s
We had a chance...We could have stopped them!  The mob stole the trucks and smashed everything up.  The fools!  They cut their own throats! +++$+++ 1950s
Why, so you can go after him? +++$+++ 1980s
Long live the fighters! +++$+++ 1980s
All right. +++$+++ 1990s
To conceal a small break in the surface of the sphere. +++$+++ 1990s
Good night. +++$+++ 1950s
You can almost spit on it, can't you? +++$+++ 1930s
How much longer's that gonna take? +++$+++ 2000s
You figger Scar means to kill us? +++$+++ 1950s
That's all right. +++$+++ 1940s
Everyone's saying he's . . . dead. But I know that isn't true. I feel it in my heart. I think he just needs help. +++$+++ 1980s
I'm not sick. +++$+++ 1980s
Yes yes, I did get my degree up there. +++$+++ 1990s
Are you? +++$+++ 1980s
I just think Ricky would rather not get a bowling lesson in front of the other kids. +++$+++ 1980s
Tony. I'm sorry if things didn't work out so well for you tonight. With Terry. +++$+++ 2000s
Not according to Mrs. Rabinow. +++$+++ 2000s
Security. +++$+++ 1950s
You have no reason to feel ashamed. You haven't said anything you don't have a right to. And if anybody tells you different -- you just send them to me. +++$+++ 1990s
Now what else? DAVID I don't know. +++$+++ 1990s
All right, jesus. +++$+++ 1980s
You're not the Shipping Greenleaf's? +++$+++ 1990s
Probably another rebel patrol. They operate in here all the time. +++$+++ 1980s
What? +++$+++ 1980s
Jasmine has this thing for dolphins. I had them make it... +++$+++ 1990s
Yes.  Isn't that amazing? +++$+++ 1990s
Now look, here's something that really has a heart. This is the best invention I ever invented. +++$+++ 1930s
Shrimp and fries. +++$+++ 1990s
Jimmy, is it? Do you know me, Jimmy? +++$+++ 1990s
Give me it. +++$+++ 2000s
Why? +++$+++ 1990s
Nobody leaves. +++$+++ 2000s
We have to get off this ship!! +++$+++ 1980s
Nah, it's phony baloney -- I faked the whole thing.  It didn't hurt at all.  It was just a yoga move.  I tucked my head in. +++$+++ 1990s
Okay, O'Neil.  So you've impressed all the others.  Now try me. +++$+++ 1990s
There! You see? He admits it! You're a fake, John Doe! And for what you've done to all these good people—they ought to run you out of the country—and I hope they do it! +++$+++ 1940s
Spontaneously combust? +++$+++ 2000s
Oh well he sure did a beautiful job. Pink and gold are my favorite colors. +++$+++ 1980s
Did she leave any records here? Tax or business records? Maybe a list of employees? +++$+++ 1990s
Where’s my real dad? +++$+++ 2000s
Bill Mayhew! Some help! The guy's a souse! +++$+++ 1990s
After my wife died, I felt like a fifth wheel. You know, so many years being with one person -- a very wonderful person -- makes you always think of yourself as part of a pair...When Ethel passed away, I was lost. I couldn't function socially and I couldn't function in business. +++$+++ 1980s
It's going back down. +++$+++ 1990s
In the abstract maybe. Get a grip on yourself! But when I imagine you going out with other guys, I feel... ah... +++$+++ 1980s
What do you mean, "possessed?" +++$+++ 2000s
Well, he's still running the show, ain't he, Dad? +++$+++ 1930s
Track with me, here...  They knew the "Russians" were undercover Feeb?  They should have no-showed.  But, no, these guys show anyway, and commit murder upon federal officers.  And steal all your money...  What does that say to you? +++$+++ 2000s
They are useless! It was Kirk I needed. And I let him slip away. +++$+++ 1980s
It's over twenty miles to the crossroads. Steve'll be back in an hour. Things will straighten out then. We'll take his Jeep and get help. +++$+++ 2000s
Yeah, that's clerical. +++$+++ 1980s
You tried to fuck me in my father's office, you sick bastard. Look, Vic, whatever you wanna do in the privacy of your own home, go do it. But don't try to fuck me. I don't think of you that way. I mean, I like you a lot - +++$+++ 1990s
Promise me again... +++$+++ 2000s
I've got to make a stop in Vegas, then I'm heading to Santa Barbara. +++$+++ 1970s
I have feelings for you. +++$+++ 1990s
Interesting business. +++$+++ 1950s
That actually goes on... +++$+++ 1980s
I knew you must have. No one stops here anymore unless they do. +++$+++ 1960s
For godsakes, Jim, slow down and stop acting like the little dutch boy.  Not even you can plug all the world's leaks.  Don't you think it's a sign you're pushing too hard when your daughter sees more of you on MTV news than in person. +++$+++ 1990s
Don't take it to heart, Betsy. +++$+++ 1940s
I need the money to smooth my way, you understand? Now, have you got that sort of cash here or do we need to meet in the morning? +++$+++ 1990s
And he is living proof. +++$+++ 1990s
I tell you - this is the only way to travel. +++$+++ 1950s
I feel like we've barely spent any time together since we got here. +++$+++ 2000s
Don't tell me it's not the gas! +++$+++ 1980s
Are you all right? +++$+++ 2000s
Oh, yeah.  "The Philosophy of Time Travel". What is this? +++$+++ 2000s
I want to fuck. +++$+++ 1990s
Do you want me to say I did it? +++$+++ 2000s
What? +++$+++ 1990s
Unn. +++$+++ 2000s
You don't give us our due credit.  Our scientists have done things no one could ever do before. +++$+++ 1990s
Picking up velocity. +++$+++ 1990s
No you're not. Jack Lint is a lesson to you - he never had your brains but he's got the ambition. You haven't got the ambition but luckily you've got me. And Mr Helpmann. Mr Helpmann was very close - +++$+++ 1980s
You're shaking. +++$+++ 1980s
Have communications contact all interface centers.  Tell them due to high demand, we're at full capacity and so temporarily there's no room for anyone else on the system. +++$+++ 1920s
Good morning, Mr. President. +++$+++ 1970s
I ran into some people I knew. +++$+++ 1950s
They can't because neither knows if the other is a deranged senseless killer like the Knoxs. So, you may as well make the first move. +++$+++ 1990s
I ain't givin' you fuckin' excuses, I'm givin' you reasons. +++$+++ 1990s
I like to think that I'm a pretty astute observer of the human scene. +++$+++ 2000s
Freaked me out so bad I hid in a shopping cart for four hours. 'Course, missed the show... +++$+++ 2000s
I do spy a kind of hope, Which craves as desperate and execution as that is desperate which we would prevent. If, rather than to marry Paris, Thou hast the strength of will to slay thyself, Then it is likely thou wilt undertake a thing like death, to chide away this shame. No warmth, no breath shall testify thou livest . Each part, deprived of supple government, shall stiff and stark and cold appear, like death. Now when the bridegroom in the morning comes to rouse thee from thy bed, there art thou dead. Thou shalt be borne to that same ancient vault where all he kindred to the Capulet lie. In the meantime, against thou shalt awake, shall Romeo by my letters know our drift, and hither shall he come. And that very night shall Romeo bear thee hence to Mantua. Take thou this vial, being then in bed, and this distilling liquor drink thou off. I'll send my letters to thy lord post haste to Mantua. +++$+++ 1960s
But what? +++$+++ 1990s
I'm lost, boss.  What are we saying here? +++$+++ 1990s
The tide's running.  It'll take us to the light. +++$+++ 1970s
Somebody told her. +++$+++ 1980s
What is it? +++$+++ 1990s
Three days? I must be. +++$+++ 1990s
I'm an electrician, not a wet nurse, y'know. +++$+++ 1960s
Forget it. +++$+++ 1980s
Away put your weapon.  I mean you no harm. +++$+++ 1980s
Yes. And I've accepted. +++$+++ 1990s
I can't take him to work. +++$+++ 2000s
Six people mutilated? It had to be me, Alex. +++$+++ 1980s
I'd like to, very much -- but it depends on what dispatches are waiting for me on the mainland. +++$+++ 1940s
A massive cardiac arrest. +++$+++ 1990s
Yeah. What about the time we hid the missing heiress in the sauerkraut factory? Six scoop interviews! +++$+++ 1940s
What happened?  What's Earl doing here? +++$+++ 1990s
Our next D.A. -- I hear Bruce Wayne is throwing a fundraiser.  Did you get your invitation yet? +++$+++ 1980s

Yeah. Like the kid on your beach. I wish I could've examined that shark they caught... +++$+++ 1970s
Let's drive by where we're meeting and have a look.  Maybe take a look at Ripley's place while we're at it. +++$+++ 1990s

...They been fuckin' 'em, 'an tellin' every bow-legged one of 'em how they're payin' a thousand dollars to whatever sonofabitch kills them two boys which cut up Delilah. +++$+++ 1990s

He didn't mention a park. +++$+++ 1990s
We were trying to scare your mother. +++$+++ 1980s

If I die, then they'll be free. It's getting late, isn't it? I can tell, it's a cold feeling when it's late. It's warm then it gets cold. Jeffrey. I feel it getting cold. +++$+++ 1980s
I didn't frisk him. He must have dropped it in Burns' office. I didn't know whose it was. +++$+++ 1940s
Operator, what's today's date? +++$+++ 1980s
No, I think I will, it's safer. I have patience. +++$+++ 1990s
He must be behind that curtain. Relax. We're undercover. We need to give off the appearance of calm. You see Esther, the trick to undercover work is to try and blend in. Act as a Gentile would. +++$+++ 2000s
What? +++$+++ 2000s
Rennie, you're the best student I ever had...you have a real gift. If anybody can make use of that pen, it's you. +++$+++ 1980s
Locked. +++$+++ 1980s
You have her cell number? +++$+++ 2000s
I'm gonna stay here in this room, Sailor. I don't feel so good? This heat makes me tired. +++$+++ 1990s
Nobody's got clean kids. +++$+++ 1990s
You all watch your step.  We got some burrows goin' down seven stories here.  You fall, I don't wanna have to come pick you up. +++$+++ 1990s
You mean -- worried about my testimony? +++$+++ 1990s
Marty, do you see your suspect? +++$+++ 1980s
Just a friend. +++$+++ 2000s
I suppose. +++$+++ 1980s
You think you could make an exception just this once, boss? She came all the way down from New York. +++$+++ 2000s
I'm working with one of the victims outta Brooklyn North.  You mind I take a shot at him? +++$+++ 2000s
So far so good. +++$+++ 1980s
Yes.  We're men.  Men is what we are. +++$+++ 1990s
Jesus. Any word from Brent? +++$+++ 2000s
That's right Mike. But he's finished and came back around three ot four months ago, He's in Woodstock now. +++$+++ 1970s

Jesus. We've been at this for six months. +++$+++ 1990s

I know. +++$+++ 2000s
To celebrate how masterfully you destroyed Roston today. +++$+++ 1990s
These machines -- They're in here. +++$+++ 1990s
Can I come into bed with you for a little while, I feel terrible. +++$+++ 1980s
You don't sound like you're from here. +++$+++ 2000s
It's empty.  Why would someone build a ship like this? +++$+++ 1990s
He used that? +++$+++ 2000s
Oh, no! +++$+++ 1980s
I seem to recognize this routine. First the kiss then the touch.  Oh, what's the use. You're you. +++$+++ 1990s
The Hilton. +++$+++ 1970s
GET OFF ME! +++$+++ 1990s
...It's just that you've been there. Your advice really helps. +++$+++ 1990s
Two weeks holiday. +++$+++ 2000s
You don't have to run with me, Crease. +++$+++ 1980s
This place, the one across the street, four other ones around Ciudad Leon-- soy el Rey de las Llantas. King of the Tires. Lots of your people rollin' back over that bridge on my rubber. +++$+++ 1990s
I think your condescension is even better. +++$+++ 2000s
Does it hurt? +++$+++ 2000s
I'd say we're about even. +++$+++ 1990s
Yeah, well, what are you gonna do?  You and me, Pablo?  Are we good? +++$+++ 2000s
He's twenty-four now? A year older than you? And must be 'bout bald. +++$+++ 1990s
Only he wasn't carryin' no pistol this time. +++$+++ 1990s
Well, it's nice to know you think we're clever. +++$+++ 1960s
That's swell. But how about here?  Ever worked for Robert Knox, Emma Dill, Clarence Speer, Marian Parsons, or Jasper Lamar Crabb? +++$+++ 1970s
Jesus, can't make a buck in this market, country's going to hell faster than when that sonofabitch Roosevelt was around... too much cheap money sloshing around the world. The biggest mistake we ever made was letting Nixon get off the gold standard. Putney Drug--you boys might want to have a look at it. +++$+++ 1980s
They won't tell you anything. +++$+++ 1990s
Jesus, are the questions too tough for you already?  Let's try again--  Is your name Porter? +++$+++ 1980s

Three days. I was worried about you. How are you feeling? +++$+++ 2000s
What are you? +++$+++ 2000s
If it helps bring her back, be my guest... +++$+++ 2000s
All too easy.  Perhaps you are not as strong as The Emperor thought. +++$+++ 1980s
There weren't any wires. I looked. +++$+++ 1970s
What now? +++$+++ 1980s
Why's it here? +++$+++ 2000s
You are very pretty. I would like to kiss you. +++$+++ 1990s
Leia! +++$+++ 1980s
The first day. +++$+++ 1990s
No, no -- Jenny used to work as a waitress.  Before she met him.  But that's not where she met me.  Not in my restaurant. +++$+++ 1990s
Bring us an ashtray for Mr. KIMBALL, please. She whisks in with a crystal ashtray as they sit in silence. +++$+++ 2000s
They say we must pray to their evil god. We say we will not. +++$+++ 1980s
I don't know. I just -- there are a lot of really confused people showing up at the office. +++$+++ 2000s
Don't be nervous.  They said you'd be nervous. +++$+++ 1990s
No scaredy-cats in the Talamasca, huh...? +++$+++ 1990s
Well, why didn't you bring them? +++$+++ 1990s
Did you give him it? +++$+++ 1990s
Nine hundred meters and dropping. 800.  700.  Hang on gentlemen. +++$+++ 1970s
I must have the breakdown now. Where is Berthier? +++$+++ 1990s
You're like your mother.  You love money. +++$+++ 2000s
Why don't you go back to sleep. I'll go out and buy us some breakfast. +++$+++ 1990s
Where there is spice and spice mining there are always worms. +++$+++ 1980s
So, we'll... +++$+++ 1990s
Yeah. Right around the cheeks and chin. Boy did I have a crush on her. She was the first girl I ever put my tongue in her mouth. +++$+++ 1990s
How did you guess? +++$+++ 2000s
Yeah, we're gonna make a lotta money together, from now on. +++$+++ 1960s
Aye -- that I would, lass. +++$+++ 1990s
Prepare the ship for departure at oh-seven-hundred hours. +++$+++ 1990s
Mary Dawson, huh? Mary Dawson, my eye. That dame took you for a sleigh ride that New York will laugh about for years. She's the slickest, two- timing, double-crossing— +++$+++ 1930s
I've been buzzing you, Mr. Parrish. Are you all right? +++$+++ 1990s
Took it this morning. +++$+++ 1980s
What? +++$+++ 1990s
Hang on...  Remember that Cessna we saw at the pumping station on the Haul Road?  Belongs to the guy they got patrolling the pipeline. +++$+++ 1990s
What if you hide me? +++$+++ 2000s
Am I supposed to feel happy now? +++$+++ 2000s
You've been the man in mine. +++$+++ 1990s
Trust me. +++$+++ 1980s
Xaintrailles...!  Don't talk to me about miracles...  If I was still sitting there waiting for a miracle, I'd be dead now. Anyway... +++$+++ 2000s
So you ain't with the State no more? +++$+++ 1950s
Maybe she's right. +++$+++ 1990s
The ship's real enough.  So its anchorage must be a real place. Where is it? +++$+++ 2000s
The sailor's omen of good fortune. The hunter watching over him on his travels. +++$+++ 2000s
A mistake... +++$+++ 1980s
Not one bit. +++$+++ 1990s
I'm very angry with you, George.  Very angry.  You don't take me to California, but you take your bitch wife?  A woman? I understand you love her, but it was you and me who started this.  You and me. +++$+++ 2000s
I can see her if I want to.  I mean, with half of France in the hands of the English, what have I got to lose? +++$+++ 2000s
Pardon me? +++$+++ 1990s
Surprised? +++$+++ 1970s
Not my choice of toast, but it's your call. To your triumph over Annette. +++$+++ 1990s
People usually have to get to know me before they hate me. +++$+++ 1990s
Holding the president hostage is not something that slips your mind when you're making demands. +++$+++ 1990s
Yeah... +++$+++ 1990s
Would I?!! Why I oughta... +++$+++ 1980s
I expect. +++$+++ 1980s
Great.  Hi. I'm Erica. +++$+++ 1990s
Thank you.  Now I'll tell you why I know Wynant didn't commit those murders -  Three months ago - the night that he caught you in Julia's apartment, he found out that Julia was cheating him, and was splitting with some man.  He went to find the man. That man was.... Tanner, don't you...? +++$+++ 1930s
Where's the pinto going? +++$+++ 1980s
Ja, ja, ja. +++$+++ 1940s
I'm pretty good at signatures myself. +++$+++ 2000s
So modest. +++$+++ 2000s
Whatever!  You know how he gets.  Well, he went absolutely bonkers.  Lucy and I were frantically trying to scramble into the dumb waiter and I didn't fit any more. It was almost fatal.  And that, my dear friends, is the day... +++$+++ 2000s
This is America. There is nothing you can not buy. +++$+++ 1990s
You misinterpret everything.  We've all been friends our whole lives.  But that's the types of relationship you wouldn't understand. +++$+++ 1990s
Like me, too. +++$+++ 1990s
Stool pigeon. +++$+++ 1990s
You did go through my stuff. +++$+++ 1990s
Hi, Barney! +++$+++ 1990s
STAY WITH HIM! TIGHTEN YOUR TURN! +++$+++ 1980s
What else? Say more. +++$+++ 1990s
Well find some other way!  Be creative.  Tell them she fucks the devil... Hmm, not a bad idea... why can't you say that?  Sounds good to me... and who can prove she doesn't? +++$+++ 2000s
On the dark nights — on the stormy nights -- you can hear him. He passes like the wind; The flapping and fluttering of his great cloak beating like gaunt wings. The thunder of his horse's hooves is loud, loud and louder, beating hard, beating strong on the frozen ground as he comes riding, riding, riding. +++$+++ 1940s
I'm out, Frank. You lost faith in me. +++$+++ 1980s
So, Ruth. How's Sam? +++$+++ 2000s
What's this? +++$+++ 2000s
Let me see your hand. +++$+++ 2000s
Mary, people come to him voluntarily. +++$+++ 2000s
Hey there.  I was beginnin' to think you wasn't comin' back...  You don't look so good. +++$+++ 1990s
It pissed off a lot of parents. According to Kristen, they hunted him down; roasted him alive. +++$+++ 1980s
I know.  What can I do?  He is the boss. +++$+++ 1990s
It is to me! An' if I hafta bust way outta this place to see it, I will! +++$+++ 1970s
I went to the bank to see why. They said you emptied our accounts-- +++$+++ 1990s
Yes. +++$+++ 1970s
Oh my God. +++$+++ 1990s
It's exquisite - like a floating mansion. +++$+++ 1950s
I couldn't do it, Leah! It smelled like a dentist in there. They had these really horrible magazines, with, like, spritz cookie recipes and bad fiction and water stains, like someone read them in the tub. And the receptionist tried to give me these weird condoms that looked like grape suckers, and she told me about her boyfriend's pie balls, and Su-Chin Kuah was there, and she told me the baby had fingernails. Fingernails! +++$+++ 2000s
Yes sir. +++$+++ 1990s
I had ordered some books. "The 100 Greatest Books Ever Written." +++$+++ 1990s
I don't say he was a man like an Earthman, but I'd call him a close relative, for he was plagued by most of man's ills.  Yet, fragile as he was, he came before you -- and was superior to you. +++$+++ 2000s
If Cornwallis receives news that Clinton is coming, he'll simply hold tight and wait.  He'll fight a purely defensive battle and he'll win that. +++$+++ 2000s
IMF mainframe. +++$+++ 1990s
Now you've got all the ones with beards on one side and all the moustaches on the other. +++$+++ 1980s
You are... +++$+++ 2000s
Aces, Suits. +++$+++ 2000s
I hadn't planned on it. +++$+++ 1990s
He's dead. I want the General to see him. +++$+++ 1940s
You watch your back Hammer. Hanukkah might just be his first move. For all we know Kwanzaa could be next. There's a lot of brothers counting on you. If you fail... +++$+++ 2000s
This one will just stun ya, but this one will put ya to sleep. +++$+++ 2000s
No. What you usually say, I guess. +++$+++ 1960s
I done my shopping in Seoul last night. +++$+++ 1970s
So what?!  So fucking what?  Use your head, Violet.  The money is gone.  Gino is coming here to get it.  You think he's going to believe me if I tell him his piss-hole son stole it!  Is that what you think? I don't.  You know what I think?  I think I'm a dead man.  I'm one in the brain.  That's what I think! +++$+++ 1990s
What is it? Has he found him? +++$+++ 1930s
Sir, Mr. Philby is here. +++$+++ 2000s
Can we make breakaway speed!? +++$+++ 1980s
I have been nothing but myself since the day I was born. And if you can't see that, it's your failing, not mine. +++$+++ 2000s
How would like some Salisbury Steak with buttered noodles? +++$+++ 1990s
I've done that before. +++$+++ 1980s
Maybe a political operative of some sort-- +++$+++ 1970s
I'll see you. +++$+++ 1950s
I see. +++$+++ 1990s
How do you know it was a 'he'? +++$+++ 1970s
Railroad burned him out too. You couldn't have stopped him. +++$+++ 2000s
That's what our General Contractor told us but how can you trust someone like that? +++$+++ 1990s
You mean, like to throw 'em off? +++$+++ 2000s
Yes, I could.  I have an office in the hospital. +++$+++ 1990s
Stop it, Jez. Don't do that. +++$+++ 1990s
I know, I know. I had no idea -- +++$+++ 1990s
Do?  What can you do?  What did you expect?  He wasn't Jewish. Did you know bow they live?  Your father would never stay out this late without calling.  In thirty years he never stayed out all night. +++$+++ 1990s
We think there's a strong reason to believe it may be hiding inside one of the buildings within the sequestered area. +++$+++ 1990s
It's not that hard to find it in there, Jack--it'll take you just a minute. You just gotta go fishin'. +++$+++ 1990s
Don't be.  Nothing to be scared about, honey, I been through four years of war - this is nothing. +++$+++ 1990s
Don't you think I know that!  Put Hans on!  Hans, listen to me, that shithead doesn't know what kind of scum you are, but I do -- +++$+++ 1980s
Who sent you?!  Who sent you? +++$+++ 1990s

Just get one hand against each ear there--keep his face straight up. +++$+++ 1930s
Have the car running at the north- west checkpoint. Bob and I'll -- +++$+++ 1990s
What's wrong with you? +++$+++ 2000s
Lucky, I guess. +++$+++ 2000s
Charlie -- are you going to make a point soon? +++$+++ 1990s
Jake.  I thought you would be at work, dear. +++$+++ 1970s
Come on, sweetheart -- what is this? Who's coming? +++$+++ 1990s
Maybe you can talk sense into your boyfriend. +++$+++ 1990s
A buck a shot. +++$+++ 1990s
Unprofessional. +++$+++ 1990s
What would <u>that</u> be? +++$+++ 2000s
Yes, Mister Harding? +++$+++ 1970s
Okay. +++$+++ 1970s
Oh yeah. They good. Can't say they ain't good. I wouldn't trade them for another pair, tell you that. But you come back in a few days - give me a chance to lead'em to it. All right? +++$+++ 1990s
He was my college sweetie! Look at him. He looks so handsome on t.v. What the hell is he doing in Panama. +++$+++ 1990s
Yeah, they dig him up and cart him back.  He gets thawed out, wakes up and scares the shit out of them. And they get into one hell of a brawl... +++$+++ 1980s
Is that true? +++$+++ 1930s
Well, at least the bastard can't climb.  Pardon my French. +++$+++ 1990s
I'm going to see the Diva sing. What's the matter?... Do I look bad? +++$+++ 1990s
Well you tell him ta take it easy with that. He's gotta learn ta respect women the way Connor does. +++$+++ 1990s
Mostly caffeine diuretics.  Help you go to the bathroom. +++$+++ 1990s
Yes Commander? +++$+++ 1990s
What do you think? +++$+++ 1970s
He saw an owl. +++$+++ 1990s
They would? +++$+++ 1930s
Your hair's different. +++$+++ 1980s
What's that supposed to mean? +++$+++ 1990s
...tonight... +++$+++ 1990s
Why?  What's wrong with me? +++$+++ 1990s
About a year and a half. +++$+++ 1990s
Nell... please, Nell... take a deep breath... +++$+++ 1990s
Thank you, Mr. Scott. I'll try not to take that personally.  My friends... I can't ask you to go any further. Dr. McCoy and I have to do this. The rest of you do not. +++$+++ 1980s
Tonight I want to relax with you. The Senator from Nevada is here with some people from Washington. I want to show them a good time in Havana. +++$+++ 1970s
One little guy with a cheap rifle - look what he can do. +++$+++ 1990s
Sounds perfect. I can park my car back there? +++$+++ 1990s
What do I tell your mother? +++$+++ 1990s
It better be. +++$+++ 1990s
Why do you think he did it? +++$+++ 1990s
Did you wish to see someone? +++$+++ 1980s
I'll call you. +++$+++ 1970s
Cecelia is, well...you know +++$+++ 2000s

He's gonna be okay. Could do a bit. +++$+++ 2000s
Let' s do it. +++$+++ 1990s
Do you think that's what he wants? +++$+++ 1990s
Ah.  A philosopher. +++$+++ 1990s
I see without seeing. To me, darkness is as clear as daylight. What am I? +++$+++ 1990s

Alla puttanesca. +++$+++ 2000s

See the cross of the Lord. Be gone you hostile power. O'Lord hear my prayer. +++$+++ 1970s
You get the money? +++$+++ 1990s
It's nothing personal data. You have to remember these people have rejected technology. And you... +++$+++ 1990s
Well, I should say! +++$+++ 1930s
What's 'incidentals?' +++$+++ 2000s
They don't serve wine here. +++$+++ 2000s
You told us about the appearance of this... voice.  What exactly did you see?  Part of it... or all of it? +++$+++ 2000s
Don't worry -- I've never seen men so determined. You've given them a way to fight... And I don't think -- +++$+++ 1980s
Yeah, they suck. +++$+++ 1990s
You don't have to do a thing. Chemically we are already quite sympathetic. +++$+++ 1930s
Do you remember? +++$+++ 1990s
So where's the party? +++$+++ 1990s
What's it about? +++$+++ 2000s
Do I wanna go to Memphis and get married? +++$+++ 1990s
They are?  Have you ever eaten with one?  Liebkind, go!  Kill! +++$+++ 1960s

And that's what caused the contamination? +++$+++ 2000s
HARRY and I have been talking about school. In fact, I want to ask you something. +++$+++ 2000s
Look on the bright side.  If we miss the rent, what's the worst they can do? +++$+++ 1990s
And suddenly, Steve, suddenly you notice that they like you. They honour you, suddenly you are the director of the best museum in the world, for example. +++$+++ 2000s
I--I don't know. I--I'm afraid they've got me licked. +++$+++ 1930s
I have to throw up... +++$+++ 1980s
No...look I'm busy... +++$+++ 1950s
You know how I feel? +++$+++ 1970s
Top drawer. Maybe if you didn't call me ma'am, things would work out better. +++$+++ 1960s
Sometimes a story is a mask for a covert operation.  See-- two men killed in a restroom, and two unidentified men in a running					* shootout, ending at the						* Marriot... +++$+++ 1990s
You're wanted at the C.O.'s. +++$+++ 1990s

What! +++$+++ 1970s
We ain't exactly in what you'd call your high traffic neighborhood either. +++$+++ 2000s
*                     We could always put you in a duck blind with a twelve gauge.  The second amendment types'll love that. +++$+++ 1990s
About anything. +++$+++ 1990s
Never saw the point of 'em. +++$+++ 2000s
I've never even met you. +++$+++ 2000s
I like this. I like doing business in the home. It's cozy...  Who's birthday? +++$+++ 2000s
Who the hell are they? +++$+++ 1990s
What do you want, Courtney? +++$+++ 2000s
Yeah. +++$+++ 1990s
...And one of those guys was you! The last one, I might add, which-if you're too stupid to comprehend- means that I've been faithful to you since we met! All the other guys I went with before I met you, so, if you want to have a complex about it, go ahead!  But don't look at me like I'm the town whore, because you were plenty busy yourself, before you met me! +++$+++ 1990s
Where are we going? +++$+++ 2000s
The 2-3.  Homicide. +++$+++ 2000s
I was the world's sweetest ingenue. +++$+++ 1930s
Parading's better! +++$+++ 1960s
After all, Mr. Roundy, we're paying six percent. Six percent. FHA's at eight and a half -- no, we won't be going back to the old days. +++$+++ 1970s
I've seen you going by on your board, but I didn't realize -- you're so young... to be so... +++$+++ 1990s
Us is over.  You had your chance you blew it. +++$+++ 1980s
Now is that clear? +++$+++ 1990s
Hi, doll, what's wrong? +++$+++ 1970s
There's an autopsy ordered at Bellevue immediately. You better skip over there. +++$+++ 1930s
Short? It's ended. +++$+++ 1990s
No matter how many times I leave the toilet seat up, she forgets and puts it down. +++$+++ 1990s
Yes. It is unfortunate. +++$+++ 1930s
I know what I have to know. +++$+++ 1990s
I *don't* think that's the thing to do! No! I think what you ought to do is--*fight*! +++$+++ 1930s
What are you doing? +++$+++ 1980s
I already know you think you're worthless.  I recommend you learn to think of yourself in a better light, for what you believe you are is what you become.  I haven't been involved in anything like this for many years. +++$+++ 1970s
Please... be cool. +++$+++ 1980s
Not before you agree to use those reservations to Moscow. +++$+++ 1930s
You could tell me your name. And where you're going. +++$+++ 1990s
You lame Taylor? +++$+++ 1980s
You bastard... +++$+++ 1990s
Let us put it to the test. Protect yourself with every scientific precaution you can think of. I'll go out on the cliff and build a votive fire to Hermes -- not that I believe in him any more than I do in Science. +++$+++ 1940s
Will Senator Smith yield to his colleague? +++$+++ 1930s
What have I done? +++$+++ 1990s
Can I come in? +++$+++ 1990s
The Joker is a murderer. And you were as good as dead. So -- +++$+++ 1980s
I am beginning to know Mr. Nehru. +++$+++ 1980s
Relax, son. They'll learn in time that you don't fuck with First Bank. This is the real deal and we aim to keep it strong. My Daddy always told me that Only The Strong Survive. +++$+++ 2000s
Yeah, that's right, Frank, you better ask him. I mean, don't hurt his feelin's or anything, but it would be good to know. I'm sure it's nothin'. He seems real sweet. +++$+++ 1990s
I want him! +++$+++ 1980s
Who do you know who can? Where do we go? +++$+++ 2000s
No -- I must find it --  Fourteen thousand two hundred marks. +++$+++ 1930s
I'm not. He does walk funny. Don't you see that? +++$+++ 1970s
Huh? +++$+++ 2000s
The people killed were mauled and their brains were eaten.  Just like Beauregard.  One part of the brain was extracted with surgical precision.  The hypothalamus and thalamus to be exact. +++$+++ 1990s
I knew she was Japanese going into it, but she didn't tell me the ninja assassin part-- +++$+++ 1990s
I ratchet your ignition mechanism ... +++$+++ 2000s
Besides, I'm not stupid, Earl. The tape was a basic Maxell D-80.  You can buy 'em at any store.  There's no way they can pin anything on me. +++$+++ 1990s
I feel fine. +++$+++ 1970s
Congratulations. You should spit in my face. +++$+++ 2000s
Oh--a wonderful thing--yes. Get you right in the mood--yes--yes. +++$+++ 1930s
Now go to sleep.  It's very late. +++$+++ 1970s
No.  That woman wouldn't of said shit if she had a mouthful. +++$+++ 1990s
Tom...why don't I meet you there? I've got some last minute stuff I've got to take care of...Hey, how did you resolve your dilemma -- did you rent the tux or buy it...I knew it. How much?  Wow...Okay...See you there... +++$+++ 1980s
We've got our best people on it, Mr. Sayer. +++$+++ 2010s
She knew what was going to happen to me. That's why she hid me away. +++$+++ 1980s
My skin's dry, my exoskeleton is cracking...I wish I'd never met you, you ruined my life. +++$+++ 1990s
Have them sealed off. +++$+++ 1990s
And the only other remaining sample was in the canister you recover from Ambrose. +++$+++ 2000s
Do us a favour? +++$+++ 2000s
How long can you go without sleep? +++$+++ 2000s
I can't talk you into it? +++$+++ 1980s
Let me go!  Let me bring her back. I can't get along without her. I'll bring her right back and I'll tell you anything you want to know. Let me go! +++$+++ 1930s
Am I hurting you? +++$+++ 1990s
No!  No!  I can't do this! +++$+++ 1990s
A mistake. +++$+++ 1990s
Just for curiosity sake that's all? +++$+++ 1990s
How's yours? +++$+++ 1970s
I think I saw a TV show like that when I was a kid.  Where a boy... +++$+++ 1990s
What about "climbing in?" +++$+++ 2000s
I believe in you, me, and Rock and Roll. And I'm not too sure about you lately. +++$+++ 1980s
Eight forty-two, sir. +++$+++ 1930s
I am a Starfleet Officer. +++$+++ 1980s
Oh, yes, of course. But where are we going? +++$+++ 1980s
We almost had an accident today. DeJesus' suit... +++$+++ 1980s
You sure? +++$+++ 1990s
How did you hurt your hand? +++$+++ 1990s
How will you fix it? +++$+++ 2000s
Well, if the A.T.F. guy is the one who wants you, that'll only interest him up to a point. +++$+++ 1990s
Leaving what? +++$+++ 1990s
Phillippe! +++$+++ 1990s
What's happening? +++$+++ 2000s
My mother. +++$+++ 1960s
More the merrier. +++$+++ 1990s
Business is business.  Don't have To love 'em to work with 'em.  Not If there's money in it. +++$+++ 1990s
The Writings of Saint Thomas Aqu... Aquin... +++$+++ 1970s
That goddamn Neanderthal? I'm the one who gave him the idea for the combination bug spray-sun screen! Did you know that?! +++$+++ 2000s
Did your mother know you were going to see your father? +++$+++ 1970s
Smart gal. +++$+++ 1930s
It's not good enough. +++$+++ 1990s
Can't make enough swords! +++$+++ 1980s
No, I don't. +++$+++ 2000s
What's your fucking problem? +++$+++ 2000s
Money problems? +++$+++ 1990s
Come on, daddy-o. You haven't said a word since we started. Least you could do is make some friendly conversation. +++$+++ 2000s
Well, I live downtown. +++$+++ 1980s
Dad, look what I drew. +++$+++ 1990s
You'll have a hard time finding a woman like that these days -- +++$+++ 1990s
You want to fuck her? +++$+++ 2000s
You were very careless with our precious jewels, my dear. They're too expensive a toy for two children to play with. +++$+++ 1930s
What, though?  It can't be the Republicans--he'd never allow something as stupid as this, not when he's gonna slaughter McGovern anyway. +++$+++ 1970s
Ah! My lady! The tide waits for no man, but I swear it would wait for you! +++$+++ 1990s
Simon's home. I was sort of hoping you could keep the dog until he's had a chance to think and adjust... +++$+++ 1990s
What kind of activity? +++$+++ 2000s
If you did that, you'd get nothing except the police after you. If you wait -- I'll give you your six thousand back -- +++$+++ 1930s
Read the inscription on the cover! +++$+++ 1990s
When I said I’d never done a wedding before, I didn’t say that no one ever asked. I just never said yes. +++$+++ 2000s
Kristen's story really got to her. +++$+++ 1980s
Mary, we really have to go. +++$+++ 1990s
I don't have to tell you what a comfort anonymity can be in my profession -- like a warm blanket.  My deal with Job was subject to a successful boot scan.  Obviously it didn't pass muster.  Deal's off. +++$+++ 1990s
Freddy Krueger.  He was a child murderer before he died.  After he died, he became ...something worse.  Six years ago Freddy killed my friends. He almost killed me.  I thought I got rid of him -- but I guess he was too strong. +++$+++ 1980s
Everything I...you know... +++$+++ 1990s
I'll take it from here --  I am -- +++$+++ 1990s
You'd worry that something was wrong if Congress offered you unconditional support. +++$+++ 2000s
Yes. +++$+++ 1960s
With me you can always do business. +++$+++ 1930s
Mind if I have a look? +++$+++ 1990s
What? +++$+++ 1990s
You told him I was throwing a deuce, right? +++$+++ 1980s
What do you want, Jim? +++$+++ 1990s
What's the matter? +++$+++ 1930s
Well, it was nice meeting you again, Mr. Stephens. +++$+++ 1990s
Well, there's fishing and boating. There's concerts on the mainland and... but I feel silly telling you. This is really your home. You probably know better than I what there is to do. +++$+++ 1970s
Well, it's Friday night and you're a beautiful girl. I guess you would have a date, that does that. +++$+++ 1980s
I'm really sorry. +++$+++ 1990s
Yes, Bob, I do.  Excuse me? Am I being fired? +++$+++ 1990s
Thinkin' a second, baby. +++$+++ 1990s
I'll go. I'll bring Jake out here. +++$+++ 1980s
Stop fooling around in there. +++$+++ 1990s
Thank you. honey. +++$+++ 1980s
Colson doesn't know about it; he's pure as a virgin on this one.  It's just not clear the burglars knew what they were looking for.  They were heading to McGovern's office later that night. +++$+++ 1990s
Bobby laid his own tracks.  He could have gone quietly but he played the hard-ass con till the end. And as far as I'm concerned, he wife and kid are a hell of a lot better off without him.  Now take the money. +++$+++ 2000s
I'm serious. This is how you do it. I'm telling you. +++$+++ 1990s
-- Your mother, God bless her, stood by me for forty-two years -- we never once contemplated divorce - I assume you're talking here about divorce? The very thought -- +++$+++ 1990s
I was freezing from the hurricane -- +++$+++ 2000s
We were due to go back out on the same ship. Six months of tests.  If you were married you got a state-room.  Otherwise it was bunks. +++$+++ 1980s
Why would she come here... +++$+++ 1990s
Listen, son, you gonna get smart, you can leave right now. +++$+++ 1970s
So we have a chance of getting back together again. +++$+++ 2000s
Whatever I say, you'll take him away, won't you? +++$+++ 1980s
Can you drive? +++$+++ 1990s
Poor Harry, I wish he was dead, he would be safe from all of you then. +++$+++ 1940s
He needs a doctor. +++$+++ 2000s
They're on me. They're smoking me out! +++$+++ 1990s
I know. +++$+++ 2000s
Don't cross Gordon. He'll crush you. You've worked hard to get where you are. If Gordon doesn't buy Bluestar someone else will; and who's to say they won't do the same thing. +++$+++ 1980s
If the house is empty again, I don't know -- +++$+++ 1930s
Did the boy say that any of them are in immediate danger? +++$+++ 2000s
I only desire what gives you pleasure, my dearest. +++$+++ 1990s
You're not going to phone anybody where I am. +++$+++ 1940s
I've got to go see Gruber.    What's the best cigars you have? +++$+++ 1970s
It's the way he said it. Just the way my dad did, when he was caught in a lie. That's how you knew you were onto something ugly. +++$+++ 2000s
The Dark Prince is here. +++$+++ 2000s
He's got an answer for everything, but he doesn't have an alibi. +++$+++ 1990s
We're ready, sir. I've converted the Dilithium Sequencer to something less primitive. And Admiral -- I've replaced the Klingon Food Packs. They was givin' me sour stomach. +++$+++ 1980s
Oh. He's got it under control... +++$+++ 1990s
Good. He said he'd be over for dinner at eight...  I mean... he misses you, Mom... +++$+++ 1990s
To kill your wife. +++$+++ 2000s
Sure.  Uh, excuse me... are you by any chance a serial killer?  Oh, you are? Well, come with us then, if it's okay. +++$+++ 1970s
You say the cutest things. +++$+++ 1950s
No, nothing's like it used to be. +++$+++ 1990s
We inspected the body, Marquis. She died a virgin. +++$+++ 2000s
The same windows. +++$+++ 2000s
Wellllll, if you read it it must be true. Was it in the Star, or the Enquirer? +++$+++ 1990s
She will, Mr.  LaLoosh, she will ... +++$+++ 1980s
This nigger's breaking up my place, Sheriff Langston. +++$+++ 1980s
Go, girl, seek happy nights to happy days. +++$+++ 1960s
You said that? +++$+++ 1970s
It's got nothing to do with my mother! She's had leukemia for -- ! This is what makes me boil about him! HE wants me back! -- it's got nothing to do with my mother. +++$+++ 1990s
Yeah. I bet he would. +++$+++ 1990s
Whatever suggested the idea to you? +++$+++ 1990s
Relax, will you. +++$+++ 1990s
Why were the other two women killed? +++$+++ 1980s
What do you mean "grand theft auto?" This is insane. +++$+++ 2000s
Yeah. Before I kick your ass. +++$+++ 1990s
What would? +++$+++ 1990s
I resent God's monopoly. +++$+++ 1930s
You are not allowed to act this way. +++$+++ 1990s
Yeah. How did you know? +++$+++ 1970s
He's already got one mother, he doesn't need two...He's yours...  I won't fight you for him any more. He's yours... +++$+++ 1970s
... and maybe the king will give you some money, and a little land, and a title even...  ... wouldn't that be a fine thing? You, a lady of title! +++$+++ 2000s
It’s okay. The cops did it. +++$+++ 1980s
Yeah! No more clicks and whistles! Now she speaks perfect English! +++$+++ 2000s
I'm not interested in your literary recommendations. +++$+++ 1930s
I want to talk to Leon. +++$+++ 1970s
Yeah.  It was all over after Buford nailed Seaver's first pitch outta the park. +++$+++ 2000s
The Prosecutor objected to your sentence for possession; he wanted a smuggling conviction and the High Court in Ankara reviewed it. +++$+++ 1970s
Where'd that come from? He holds up a giant key chain. +++$+++ 2000s
...An attempt at humor, I suppose. +++$+++ 2000s
So... Board convenes tomorrow, you'll recommend, we close and it's a deal, right? +++$+++ 1990s
A magician *makes* magic.  Any fool can use it. +++$+++ 1980s
I wish it could all have been different. +++$+++ 1980s
I just can't absorb it all. This place, the equipment. What it must have cost.  Why all the secrecy? Why do you wear the mask? +++$+++ 1980s
Why'd call me a killer? +++$+++ 1950s
"To Daddy from Amy." Here's one for Miss Callahan. This one says, "To Edward from Amy.". +++$+++ 1940s
Breaker. Breaker. +++$+++ 1970s
Forgiveness? +++$+++ 1990s
So is Dewey your real name? +++$+++ 1990s
Twins, Max. Sixteen-year-olds. Can you imagine the mathematical possibilities? +++$+++ 1970s
Yes, see, they move very easily through the Pleistocene Alluvials...  ...the dirt...the loose soil that makes up the valley floor.  But they can't move through solid rock. I think we should travel west to the mountains. +++$+++ 1990s
We need more bread and some baked lasa--  uh, lasagne.  Hi. +++$+++ 1980s
Robert asks about you. When are you going to do something to help him? +++$+++ 1990s
What religion do you profess, Preacher? +++$+++ 1950s
Maybe. But this isn't about living or dying. It's about good versus evil, and we're good, whether we like it or not... Maybe we look a little funny... +++$+++ 1990s
But there's nothing here. +++$+++ 2000s
Oh, uh, listen, David called me up. +++$+++ 1980s
No, I celebrate at the beginning of my corporate tax year which is March first. That way I beat the crowds. +++$+++ 1980s
Are you still coming? +++$+++ 1990s
I'll see ya around, huh? +++$+++ 1990s
How true. But I still feel I deserve more than you do of this treasure. I mean, I found it. +++$+++ 2000s
What do you do? +++$+++ 1960s
No. +++$+++ 1970s
No, I believed her. She was in pretty bad shape. Inside and out. But the boys were never formally charged. +++$+++ 2000s
What makes you think I would do that? +++$+++ 1990s
This isn't our goddamn game! +++$+++ 2000s
I mean, he's a smart kid, he'll get by -- he takes after me. You're too sensitive. +++$+++ 1980s
Constantly sick. +++$+++ 1990s
I've already lost it. +++$+++ 1970s
I'm sure it is, but I had hepatitis. +++$+++ 1970s
Dear Sir... enclosed find check for $100.  Yours very truly...  Send that immediately. +++$+++ 1930s
And then what? +++$+++ 2000s
Aye, I knew you were. +++$+++ 1960s
In movie they make of us, who do you think would act me? +++$+++ 2000s
Check one-two. Check one-two. +++$+++ 2000s
Now just a minute... +++$+++ 2000s
We walked the place for a week. +++$+++ 2000s
Goodbye, Donald. +++$+++ 2000s
F for... +++$+++ 1980s
Yeah.  Old times. +++$+++ 1990s
Ha ha ha.  Hoo hoo hoo. +++$+++ 2000s
How was the emergency, Doctor? Profitable, I hope. +++$+++ 1970s
He's hiding something. +++$+++ 1980s
Amen. +++$+++ 1990s
If you do, Mr. Norton, you're just as much of a dumb cluck as he is! Excuse me. +++$+++ 1940s
That leaves two strangers. +++$+++ 1990s
Not much -- you? +++$+++ 1990s
How about a trig study group?  Right after dinner. +++$+++ 1980s
You're not tired of it? +++$+++ 1990s
I saw Lucy when I was in London, she seems okay.  It's hard to tell with her. +++$+++ 2000s
It's time for drastic remedies. +++$+++ 1970s
Why don't you shut up now. +++$+++ 2000s
But -- +++$+++ 1980s
Now release the brake. And slide the stick into first gear. +++$+++ 2000s
Afraid not. +++$+++ 1990s
Good-bye, Peter. +++$+++ 1980s
Thank you. +++$+++ 1930s
You think you accomplished something... like you're heroes? Fuck you!   This is meaningless! You'll never win!  You know, as soon as I'm gone... someone's going to take my place. +++$+++ 2000s
What's the thing? +++$+++ 1990s
Alright, let's boot up. +++$+++ 1990s
You know what they say.  You have the same chance of winning whether you play or not. +++$+++ 2000s
Got it. +++$+++ 1990s
Alvy, uh, let's face it. You know something, don't think our relationship is working. +++$+++ 1970s
Yeah, and we do it twenty times a day.  Don't give me that crap. Just put on the taps.  Now. +++$+++ 1990s
And you just want to ask me a few questions? +++$+++ 1970s
Yeah, right.  I don't know why I bothered inviting you guys.  I knew you wouldn't show. +++$+++ 2000s
That's lucky. +++$+++ 1990s
Uh, sir... +++$+++ 2000s
While you eat, you look at the view. +++$+++ 1930s
Not this minute. +++$+++ 2000s
Please sir. Please - +++$+++ 1990s
It's Thanksgiving. +++$+++ 1970s
The XK 101. Luthor, that operates on radio waves. And with our fail-safe system, only the President himself can push that button. +++$+++ 1970s
No. I didn't used to be bad. No sir. Where do you get this stuff? From your mother? +++$+++ 1990s
Well, what does it have to do with? Us? +++$+++ 1990s
We could send Mac.  If he can retrieve one suit, we could go back for the other. +++$+++ 1990s
How is he? +++$+++ 1990s
Let me know. +++$+++ 1990s
President Kennedy threatened to smash the CIA into a thousand pieces.  You could do the same ... +++$+++ 1990s
Man, all it got to do is find their weak spot.  You bet on the machine in any fight you name, you gonna win your bet. +++$+++ 1980s
Can you really see through anything? +++$+++ 1970s
See what? +++$+++ 1990s
Then why does she act so dumb? +++$+++ 1990s
Regardez.  Voila Monsieur David Warfield. +++$+++ 1980s
Son, I'm grown. Don't got patience to suffer you children and this monkey junk. I'm too old to play house...  ...and cowboys. So let's have it. End me or get out of my face! +++$+++ 2000s
He said he wished the two of you could start over, live a normal life. +++$+++ 1990s
Sorry ... +++$+++ 1970s
Don't like the feel of it, Jack. +++$+++ 1980s
I made her nervous. +++$+++ 1980s
You?  You think you're the only one?  I've talked to them a million times, but they don't listen. +++$+++ 1990s
Si--tengo escopeto--just a shotgun-- +++$+++ 1990s
Do you always ask so many questions? +++$+++ 1960s
Well, what's wrong with it? +++$+++ 1990s
Don't worry if the old lady's there I'll brick it back up. +++$+++ 2000s
...and a rifle.  You, on the other hand... +++$+++ 1990s
But the list Golitsyn stole was a decoy. +++$+++ 1990s
Well, sure! +++$+++ 1980s
I sell biscuits and gravy all over the Southland-- +++$+++ 1990s
Adrenaline's wearing off.  You get shaky after.  It's not uncommon.  Deep breathing helps. +++$+++ 2000s
How'd you find out? +++$+++ 1990s
Why? +++$+++ 2000s
No, you're not. You're a good doctor, Lonnie, but you're not David Ravell. I've made my decision. Now, if you'll excuse me... +++$+++ 2000s
...lane six. Yes. +++$+++ 1990s
'Sokay, 'sokay. I killed it. +++$+++ 2000s
Yeah. +++$+++ 1970s
We have a very advanced program, something very different, requires very skilled people. +++$+++ 1990s
You're going to be late for your match. +++$+++ 1990s
Moving to Sweden. +++$+++ 2000s
Well, you see, I've acquired one of those new mother-in-laws, and we were afraid she wouldn't understand the whole idea. So we were going to wait till she went to Europe. +++$+++ 1930s
It was weird... +++$+++ 1990s
Well, John, the night before your father died, he told me what he did with that money. +++$+++ 1950s
Then why don't you start practicing and keep your mouth shut for a while? +++$+++ 1990s
Something to drink, Dr. Bright? +++$+++ 1990s
Exciting, wasn't it? Where's Jimmy? +++$+++ 1930s
Come on, I thought we had fun, rich boy -- +++$+++ 2000s
To talk. +++$+++ 1990s
I tell you, I saw them! +++$+++ 1930s
They have cemeteries. But not like this one... You see, they don't have any wars. +++$+++ 2000s
If I hadn't done it.  If I'd said to myself, "Screw it.  I'm going to let all those people down there live." +++$+++ 1970s
He had a mother and father -- and he knew them. +++$+++ 1970s
You were missed.  How long has it been since we've seen each other? +++$+++ 1990s
Oh no. Are you kidding me? +++$+++ 1960s
What? +++$+++ 1990s
All right.  Now just remember: keep away from those weapons unless I say otherwise.  Martin, do you read me? +++$+++ 1970s
Is this the treatment? +++$+++ 1990s
I'd be more comfortable if he slept in the guestroom. +++$+++ 2000s
She's gonna need to know that her little girl's alright. +++$+++ 1990s
Don't you know, you can't hump the Bogart. +++$+++ 1990s
- after all, the other day was one scene, the woods are full of one scene sensations. But you did it. With work and patience, you'll be a fine actress. If that's what you want to be. +++$+++ 1950s
We'll be on the other side waiting for you. If you become food I don't want the only set of keys in the belly of one of those things. It's your funeral. +++$+++ 2000s
You realize that you've brought a killer into the house. +++$+++ 2000s
I would call it-- unforgivable. +++$+++ 1990s
I... because I want to go home. She said she'd come and get me. +++$+++ 1990s
You still don't get the picture do you? I've always heard what a smart ass operator you are. +++$+++ 1970s
That?  Oh, it's a kind of Chinese fighting... I was sort of caught once with a lovely Chinese girl out in San Francisco.  Her big brothers were kind enough to teach it to me  I've got a book on it, if you're interested. +++$+++ 1990s
This is such a mess.  I come to you to protect myself against more crappy gossip and now I'm landed in it all over again.  For God's sake, I've got a boyfriend. +++$+++ 1990s
So how do we give Ordell to Nicolet? +++$+++ 1990s
So? +++$+++ 1990s
You're flushed.  And you were moaning. I think you're running a fever.  What are you doing? +++$+++ 1990s
Something's gone wrong -- something unanticipated. Go back to Dallas and dig. Or you're only going to find out like the rest of the country, Agent Mulder. When it's too late. +++$+++ 1990s
Oh hey, one more thing? +++$+++ 2000s
...trust the wisdom of the ancients, trust the Great Mother to protect us... Why. are you staring at me like that? +++$+++ 1980s
Explain that some jerk in a mask and costume fought a mad scientist with four tentacles? +++$+++ 2000s
According to his date book, and this was verified by his secretary, he had dinner with...Marcus Halberstam. +++$+++ 2000s
Shut up, Animal! +++$+++ 1950s
Yeah. +++$+++ 1990s
And I'll take that certified check, too. I've decided I can handle things around here... +++$+++ 1940s
Hitting bottom isn't a weekend retreat!  It's not a seminar!  You have to forget everything you know, everything you think you know -- about life, about friendship, about you and me. +++$+++ 1990s
Prettier than Ann? +++$+++ 1980s
What I resent, lieutenant, is some politician using my base as a test tube for her grand social experiment.  What I resent is the sensitivity training that is now mandatory for my men... the day-care center I have to build where an officer's lounge used to be... and the OB/GYN I have to keep on staff just so someone can keep track of your personal pap smears.  But most of all, lieutenant, I resent your perfume, however subtle it may be, competing with the aroma of my fine three-dollar-and-fifty- nine cent cigar, which I will happily put out this very instant if the phallic nature of it happens to offend your goddamn fragile sensibilities.  DOES IT? +++$+++ 1990s
He wanted you to know the legal limit for hexavalent chromium, is .05 parts per million.  And that at the rate you mentioned, .58, it could be responsible for the cancers in that family you asked about. The Irvings. +++$+++ 2000s
Good.  That was the plan.  We couldn't stand him and George needed help. +++$+++ 2000s
No.  Just no. +++$+++ 1970s
Five years is a long time. +++$+++ 1990s
The Prince does not like to be touched by other humans. A Silly eastern superstition, I'm afraid. +++$+++ 1990s
I can't wait to hear your opening argument.	"Ladies and Gentlemen	of the Jury... the Defense will prove that Jason Voorhees did not kill all of these people. They, in fact, committed mass suicide and then buried themselves in his back yard..." +++$+++ 2000s
No. +++$+++ 1990s
This is not a bender yet.  This is the start of a bender.  But I can see how you were confused, they look a lot alike. +++$+++ 2000s
As far away as I ever want to be. +++$+++ 1930s
All the time. They're everywhere.  You won't tell anyone my secret, right? +++$+++ 1990s
Something's coming. +++$+++ 1980s
This would be a bad time for me to leave. +++$+++ 1990s
What is it? +++$+++ 1990s
Elephants! Make way... I gotta get elephants! +++$+++ 1970s
Great.  Another deadbeat. +++$+++ 2000s
But that's what happened before. +++$+++ 2000s
It was one incident. +++$+++ 1980s
More... many more. +++$+++ 1970s
That's no shampoo.  It'smore like a pile of freehly laundred hand- kerchiefs, like a brand new auto- mobile.  How old are you anyway? +++$+++ 1950s
Sure, sure, sure. You go on home and talk about it to your wife. +++$+++ 1940s
No. +++$+++ 2000s
Yeah, somebody broke in and stole the samples, one of those animal rights groups, right?  I remember now, they freed all the monkeys which caused that huge pileup on the Massachusetts Turnpike, right? +++$+++ 1990s
We were worried about you guys so we left early to see if you were -- +++$+++ 1990s
Well, how far didya get? +++$+++ 1960s
I need to talk to Annette. +++$+++ 1990s
Yeah. +++$+++ 1990s
Yes, but listen. Christ, I didn't kill him. +++$+++ 2000s
You got a chisel round here? +++$+++ 1990s
I wish I could do more but we're moving out. +++$+++ 1990s
No.  Invite us?  No, he simply... +++$+++ 2000s
God help them. +++$+++ 2000s
Well, I don't know. He sits arounna house alla time. You know a place he can go where he can find a bride? +++$+++ 1950s
If you don't complete the assignment, you'll get a zero for the day. +++$+++ 2000s
He's not gonna be happy. And your parents can't be too thrilled either. +++$+++ 1980s
Do you really think you have a chance against us, Mr. Cowboy? +++$+++ 1980s
What the hell do you know? +++$+++ 2000s
Yeah, that's fascinating, but I'm just a fat, dumb cop lookin' for a psycho killer-- +++$+++ 2000s
I don't care about that. This time, I gotta have the rent. +++$+++ 1990s
You're not leaving. Not until we go back for the others. +++$+++ 2000s
Whatta you say we wait and give him a tail? +++$+++ 1970s
No. No thank you. +++$+++ 1990s
He's trying to form words. +++$+++ 2000s
Is he from here? +++$+++ 1970s
From what I've seen, Paden doesn't care much about money. +++$+++ 1980s
It's clean. +++$+++ 1990s
What do you want me to say? +++$+++ 2000s
From Carl Heine's boat.  All his were like this one, three-strand manila, new condition, braided in loops.  Not bowlined like Miyamoto's. +++$+++ 1990s
That's exactly my point.  Has he even directed actors before in anything? +++$+++ 2000s
Wow, a treasure map! What's the treasure? +++$+++ 2000s
I'll tell him we'll take two. +++$+++ 1980s
Yes. +++$+++ 1990s
It's okay, Mike... +++$+++ 1990s
Some people are very shy by nature. +++$+++ 1970s
How...how are you here? +++$+++ 2000s
Mercutio +++$+++ 1990s
Got what? +++$+++ 1990s
No can do. Life goes on, pointfive ... You left me, remember? +++$+++ 2000s
First of all, economic reasons.  It was cheap.  The entire project cost just a fraction of what we spent in a single year on our various space and missile programs. It also seemed ideal in most other respects. It was terrifying, convincing, automatic, and extremely simple to understand. +++$+++ 1960s
Oh, you'll remember it some time. +++$+++ 1940s
Uh.. +++$+++ 1990s
It isn't a question of knowing what to do, it's knowing how to get in one that counts. +++$+++ 1930s
What's going on? +++$+++ 1990s
Then what are you doing here? Come on, people, let's go!  And Cooper... Put some pants on. +++$+++ 1990s
--Shhhhhhut upppp you fffffffreak! +++$+++ 1990s
Yes, Sir. But this -- creature is a special case. +++$+++ 2000s
This has to be a big mistake. +++$+++ 2000s
Is that yours? +++$+++ 1960s
Like my pistola. +++$+++ 2000s
She'll be here in a moment. She has a special surprise for you. +++$+++ 2000s
I came for love... +++$+++ 2000s
I miss her. I miss my wife. +++$+++ 2000s
You don't either.  We won't know anything until we find that guy and find out if he's alive or what. +++$+++ 1990s
Tell me Vincent.  Tell me what you think. +++$+++ 2000s
Oh, I'd better hurry back.  I don't want to miss one minute of it. +++$+++ 1960s
Shit! +++$+++ 2000s
There's a million dollars in there, maybe <u>two</u> million.  I'll give you half. +++$+++ 2000s
It's a good thing my family loves you. +++$+++ 2000s
No you're not!  This marriage was never consummated.  I'm getting an annulment! +++$+++ 1990s
Is it her that's bothering you--or your gardener? +++$+++ 1980s
...a Mrs. Doneghy called... I told you that. +++$+++ 1980s
Look at you, not even breaking a sweat. You're cool, boy.  You're cool. +++$+++ 1990s
Okay, "bro," this jig is up...  Just get in the bottle. Just slide right on in there. +++$+++ 2000s
Ed, how're you holding up? +++$+++ 2000s
No use waiting, then. +++$+++ 1990s
I wanted to give it all to the church. +++$+++ 2000s
Where's my bag? +++$+++ 1990s
No. +++$+++ 1970s
Parker. +++$+++ 2000s
I thought you were buying my company. +++$+++ 1990s
Get the hell out of here.''! +++$+++ 2000s
You...made that? +++$+++ 1950s
-Okay okay. +++$+++ 1980s
I may call you worse than that. +++$+++ 1980s
If we could change something in your life, anything at all, what would you like that to be? +++$+++ 1990s
We'll go to the country sometime, okay? +++$+++ 2000s
Eh, could I have my pen back now, please? +++$+++ 1970s
Oh. +++$+++ 1960s
She fucked us both. +++$+++ 1970s
We're supposed to be honest. +++$+++ 2000s
Okay. Well, you know, he's always been a nice guy and I like him. +++$+++ 1990s
Blue suit, gray suit, I'm still a fat man. A fat ugly man. +++$+++ 1950s
Hy-Brasil? +++$+++ 1980s
This is wonderfully accommodating of you all.  Now I won't have to come looking for you. +++$+++ 1990s
Yeah -- +++$+++ 1980s
Get a boob job. +++$+++ 1990s
I need your help. +++$+++ 2000s
You damn right they didn't, especially Emory, my cousin. +++$+++ 1990s
Sang. +++$+++ 1990s
The present city of Iskenderun is built on its ruins. Marcus -- you remember what the Grail Tablet said. "Across the desert and through the mountain to the Canyon of the Crescent Moon."  But where exactly? +++$+++ 1980s
Shit. Shit. I know it's here. Hold on. +++$+++ 2000s
So, hi there.  I'm... Sister Mary Clarence.  And you're... young Christians.  I guess I should assign you this passage.  What's good?  What were you talking about? +++$+++ 1990s
What would you like it to be to me...? I, I, I can't invest in failure. +++$+++ 1980s
This one , Lance? +++$+++ 1970s
I... I'm not sure...  ...I... oohhh... Excuse me... +++$+++ 1990s
And now that Wally's coming back, and because he'll certainly *need* you... +++$+++ 1990s
Yes, I'll tell you - for the same reason I've never wanted to go out with those social parasites, those sweet-smelling fashion plates. I don't like them. They bore me. They give me the jitters. +++$+++ 1930s
Between... +++$+++ 1990s
You know nothing about feelings, natural or unnatural. +++$+++ 1950s
Try me. +++$+++ 1930s
Don't cut me off. This is an emergency. +++$+++ 1990s
I'm sorry, Bull. It's never easy. He was a good soldier. +++$+++ 1980s
If it wouldn't be too much of a bother... a little bite to eat would be... +++$+++ 1980s
Sure you can. We gotta nail this guy. You'll be fine. +++$+++ 2000s
Need to have you check these out before he goes on that Walker benefit. +++$+++ 1970s
No. Grammoo said she's in heaven. +++$+++ 1990s
Really? +++$+++ 1990s
I think you might of dreamed this one, Anthony. +++$+++ 1990s
I think he called you beautiful. +++$+++ 1980s
What? Is there someone else? +++$+++ 1980s
Here goes nothing. +++$+++ 1980s
I've been trapped by Miles Kastle my whole life. She walks over to her scooter, and mounts it. +++$+++ 1990s
Well, darlin' <u>I</u> ain't your confessor.  Tell him you've got some info on the President's sex scandal, it's on your conscience, believe me, he'll drop what he's doing.  Okay;  <u>Now</u>:  Folks, folks, folks, this is a shitty business, and it needs no Ghost Come From the Grave to tell us that.  But in Six Days, Lord willing n'Jesus Tarries, I am going to take you beauties into the second term. .....wait til you hear the speech tonight.  The 3-0-3 Speech... where's the Fad King, by the way... +++$+++ 1990s
So I did! And what was so important about it? +++$+++ 1990s
You open it. +++$+++ 1990s
But have never been? +++$+++ 2000s
Admiral. Full power is restored. +++$+++ 1980s
Alfredo, go fuck yourself!!! +++$+++ 1980s
Oilie, that's for the children to play with. +++$+++ 1940s
So, I'm thinking prom is basically our last big chance. +++$+++ 1990s
Well, I don't know what else to say. It's a helluva party -- +++$+++ 1990s
I'm coming with you. +++$+++ 1990s
Turn off the light. +++$+++ 1990s
Come on, Doc, you must be kiddin'. +++$+++ 1970s
But a half million dollars! My goodness, where are we going to get— +++$+++ 1930s
TURK, what are you doing here? +++$+++ 2000s
It's too soon to know. +++$+++ 1990s
Thank you for this honor, my dear. +++$+++ 1990s
A small loan would be welcome. More urgently, I need access to a telephone and an address where things can be sent to me. +++$+++ 1990s
Why so remote, Addison? I should think you'd be at the side of your protegee, lending her moral support... +++$+++ 1950s
Oh. Thank you. +++$+++ 1970s
Go back to Bulgaria. +++$+++ 1940s
You took me to the house. +++$+++ 1990s
Uh, beg to differ. +++$+++ 1990s
That's probably good. +++$+++ 1990s
See that, I don't feel it. I can take it. I know I can take anybody. +++$+++ 1980s
Houdini's sick. +++$+++ 2000s
Say it not lightly...  Do you know its meaning? +++$+++ 1980s
They will want a lot of money. +++$+++ 1990s
Oh my G-d, they want me to anchor.  They want me to anchor tonight! +++$+++ 2000s
Take her out, Mr. Saavik. +++$+++ 1980s
10-4 good buddy. +++$+++ 1990s
Fine. But what would I do at night? +++$+++ 1990s
You're not with the FBI or anything, are you? +++$+++ 2000s
Where did he go? +++$+++ 2000s
The door's sealed from inside.  Doc Revna's in there, and it sounds like Ackland's going nuts. +++$+++ 1990s
You get off havin' control over me. Let me choose how to deal with it. +++$+++ 2000s
Sure -- He can hit -- Don't play no more -- Stick an' move, hear? +++$+++ 1970s
I know! +++$+++ 1980s
Yes, you should go. +++$+++ 1960s
H A R R Y... +++$+++ 2000s
Get a grip. Reed. We didn't come all this way to lose our nerve at the first little glitch. Just close the shields... +++$+++ 2000s
Fifteen and two thirds, actually. +++$+++ 1960s
...Ya gave Dipper my locker. +++$+++ 1970s
Nicholson and I go to work on him. Now er know somthing's rotten in Denmark, 'cause this dickhead had a big bag, and it's uncut, too, so we're sweatin' him, trying to find out where he got it. Scarin' the shit outta him. +++$+++ 1990s
It wasn't Toontown they wanted.  It was my idea of how to put the land to better use. +++$+++ 1980s
If he's not Madison, then where's Madison? +++$+++ 1990s
No. +++$+++ 1980s
Make it dry.  Baby doesn't like to be wet.  You're Valiant, right?  The name's Baby Herman. +++$+++ 1980s
Oh, nothin', you know. +++$+++ 1990s
Please!! NO!!! +++$+++ 1990s
-- I guess it's all got to do with this shop. +++$+++ 1970s
-- open circuit breakers -- +++$+++ 1970s
You just got a Mickey. +++$+++ 1980s
You gotta kill yourself. +++$+++ 2000s
Don't take any guff from those swine. Remember, if you have any trouble you can always send a telegram to the Right People. +++$+++ 1990s
Ben Corbett? +++$+++ 1990s
Tell me, Sheila. What are you afraid of? Sheila shakes her head. +++$+++ 1990s
Wherever he wants to. I think he's going back to Millsburg where he's from. It's just about twenty miles from here. +++$+++ 1990s
We'll ground her, clip her wings a bit.  School and scheduled activities and that's it until further notice. This has to be handled delicately. Dan Kelly, in the District Attorney's office, will probably help us out, quietly.  Christ, this could be embarrassing. +++$+++ 2000s
Yes..thank God.. +++$+++ 1990s
Lookin' to make the papers, John? +++$+++ 1990s
But how convenient that the proof of his arrival has vanished?  You also state that Bright Eyes had two intelligent companions at the time of his capture. +++$+++ 2000s
Merle, I wanna go home! +++$+++ 1970s
She's at work.  I'm her mother. +++$+++ 1990s
There's one thing I have to say.  I'm going away. +++$+++ 2000s
Seriously. +++$+++ 1990s
I don't know what we're talking about. +++$+++ 2000s
More clowning!  Don't you see? +++$+++ 1970s
Yeah. Because at one time, I didn't think enough. +++$+++ 2000s
Don Alonso de Bobadilla. +++$+++ 1990s
Bring out your dead! +++$+++ 1970s
Chairman Mao can keep China. Just give us back Tibet. +++$+++ 1990s
No... Not yet.  He's very shy... and very sensitive. +++$+++ 1990s
Were you ever bar mitzvahed anywhere else? +++$+++ 2000s
Okay. You read me well enough. Why can't I read you? +++$+++ 2000s
You mixed drinks bad as you mix metaphors, you be out of a job. +++$+++ 1990s
Why? +++$+++ 1980s
With eleven hundred he could come home, and that's the last thing I want. +++$+++ 2000s
She's with me. +++$+++ 1990s
Pretty much. +++$+++ 2000s
Help me with this one, I'm really screwed up. +++$+++ 1980s
Like I always say -- +++$+++ 2000s
Home. +++$+++ 1990s
Then it don't matter. Then I'll be all aroun' in the dark. I'll be ever'where--wherever you look. Wherever there's a fight so hungry people can eat, I'll be there. Wherever there's a cop beatin' up a guy, I'll be there. I'll be in the way guys yell when they're mad--an' I'll be in the way kids laugh when they're hungry an' they know supper's ready. An' when our people eat the stuff they raise, an' live in the houses they build, why, I'll be there too. +++$+++ 1940s
Okay. +++$+++ 1990s
...No money. +++$+++ 1990s
But meant her moving here. +++$+++ 1980s
I'm telling you so when you look back on this moment, you can think... there was this guy named Utah and he was pretty much a dork but maybe not such a bad person and I let him drown in conditions he had no business being in whatsoever... when I could have easily helped him. +++$+++ 1990s
OK, Bob. I don't know his name. You know why? Because I don't care. He's Future Man. But I care about you. And to me it doesn't make sense to go back to the scene of a crime. Will you get in the car, Bob? This is stupid. +++$+++ 1990s
I am quite...preoccupied with concern about Geordi. +++$+++ 1990s
Clear on starboard -- Where's Lance an' the Captain? +++$+++ 1970s
How long has it been? +++$+++ 1990s
This is a gift you'll not return. +++$+++ 1940s
Well, fact or not, I don't see how we're going to find an ancient cemetery in these mountains tonight.  I can't see a thing!  Let's turn back. +++$+++ 1960s
What are you saying?  That I'm seeing what I want to see?  That I'm protecting a murderer?  What? +++$+++ 1990s
Dartmouth +++$+++ 1990s
Yes, of course. My concern is to protect you from any suspicion of favouritism. +++$+++ 1980s
Yeah, some creep stole my cigarettes! +++$+++ 1970s
Cool it. We got business. +++$+++ 2000s
I'm frightfully sorry. There is a telephone in the Public House about a mile down the road. I suggest you use that. +++$+++ 1970s
I know, we'll be there soon. +++$+++ 2000s
Quitting time.  Grab a cold one? +++$+++ 1990s
Why don't you let at do that...? +++$+++ 1990s
Sh! +++$+++ 1980s
I'd be delighted to... anytime you can show me the doubt. I'll wrap it up in tissue paper and put a Christmas seals on it for her. +++$+++ 1990s
What is the Matrix? +++$+++ 1990s
"Then they'd put you in jail." +++$+++ 2000s
Or a vegetarian? +++$+++ 1990s
Lestat! You knew Lestat! +++$+++ 1990s
Shut up. +++$+++ 2000s
Richard, it's secret. That's the whole point. +++$+++ 2000s
Just one question.  Since Dr. Argon no longer has feeling below his waist, how is it that you're still able to do your job? +++$+++ 1990s
Well, they're gonna. It's time this gearjammer rode to glory.  Now, move aside; good buddy. I'm coming through. +++$+++ 1970s
Us seeing each other. +++$+++ 2000s
Why won't you kiss me when we're all alone ? +++$+++ 1990s
A man in love, completely shaken. He sits on bed, thinks, then takes telephone slowly, decisively. +++$+++ 1930s
We won't need it then. +++$+++ 1970s
Kate, Scott? +++$+++ 1990s
Aw, fuck. +++$+++ 2000s
Oh I love you. +++$+++ 1970s
Yeah. +++$+++ 1990s
That's never been proven +++$+++ 1990s
Well... there's still some cell activity... it's not entirely dead yet. +++$+++ 1980s
Causes sleep. +++$+++ 1990s
How's astronaut training? +++$+++ 1980s
No longer'n we can get acrost her. +++$+++ 1940s
It can be dealt with, but only if you want to.  I can help you. +++$+++ 1990s
Okay, I'll help you.  Should we make some dip or something? +++$+++ 1980s
Oh yeah, yeah I've driven by that place before. I seem to remember a crabby old bastard in a crummy clown suit running the place. +++$+++ 2000s
I played Richard III... +++$+++ 1990s
Not this again -- +++$+++ 2000s
Tell her I lied, that I didn't take advantage of her. +++$+++ 1960s
Skye!  I'm so glad you're able to make it...it's our sixth, actually.  You read the book again?  Well, no, the ending to chapter six...it's just that it's not filmic. We tried it in an earlier draft, but, it just wasn't filmic... Well, sure, we can absolutely look at that again.  If you're coming from Laurel, you want to take Sunset west, we're just past Will Rogers State Park.  Three blocks west of that, you want to hang right.  It's about three quarters of a mile up a big white thing on the left. +++$+++ 2000s
Why did you do this? +++$+++ 1990s
Why? +++$+++ 1990s
What? +++$+++ 1990s
Getting there. +++$+++ 1980s
What is <u>this</u>? +++$+++ 2000s
Hey, speaking of Wrong Place, Wrong Time.  Lewis Lane to the rescue! +++$+++ 2000s
Anybody with hair on his chest. Get 'em off the street -- anywhere. Offer them anything -- only get them.  We've got to get this desk out of here. +++$+++ 1940s
Sure you are.  And we're not help- ing her any, feeding her lies and more lies.  Getting herself ready for a pioture ...  What happens when she finds out? +++$+++ 1950s
They can have the Estate. +++$+++ 1930s
Yeah. +++$+++ 1990s
You look as if you could. +++$+++ 1970s
She'll do nothing of the kind! She's going to church with me, right away! +++$+++ 2000s
The man who bought them last week was American. I did not see him but I heard. I knew you would come. +++$+++ 1960s
That's what I'm saying. +++$+++ 1990s
In New York. +++$+++ 1930s
How can you hang out with Casper? He's such a jerk. +++$+++ 1990s
Good morning, sir. +++$+++ 1980s
Objection, your honor.  The answer is, to be generous, very vague. +++$+++ 1970s
I agree. +++$+++ 1990s
How do you get through those winters?  Well, you're right.  Juneau.  What's the highest peak? +++$+++ 1990s
I don't know. He moved away. +++$+++ 1980s
Pete, there's time before the picture starts, you want to get some popcorn? +++$+++ 2000s
Do you need a secretary? +++$+++ 1970s
You can always come see it in London. +++$+++ 1980s
He isn't. You're not cut out for this. You're just a guy that happened to find those vehicles. +++$+++ 2000s
Willie, come on! +++$+++ 1980s
Yes. He's more than four thousand years old and still decomposing. +++$+++ 1990s
It is nine p.m.  Pleasant dreams. +++$+++ 1990s
Stress category. +++$+++ 1970s
Vaughan's "friend" will be there, too. He works at the funeral home. And Frank. You know Frank likes you a lot. He says you make him feel calm. +++$+++ 1990s
IT WASN'T A TV SHOW!  IT WAS REAL! +++$+++ 1990s
Not bad, not bad. In fact, uh, my wife's pregnant again. +++$+++ 1990s
Who is Machine? +++$+++ 1990s
Can't -- can't you -- Couldn't you come too -- I think it would be better -- for us -- for us both. +++$+++ 1930s
Blow yourself, bigmouth. +++$+++ 1990s
I take it you don't like Miss Lawson very much? +++$+++ 1990s
I don't see anything! +++$+++ 1990s
-- But it's Sunday. +++$+++ 1990s
When I was first married. +++$+++ 1990s
I've been very lazy for a long, long time. +++$+++ 2000s
She's right, Norbert--go home. WOODLY I haven't said all I have to say. +++$+++ 1970s
Sherry   Sherry  Sheerrry. ... +++$+++ 1990s
Wait a minute, sonny.  I think you better come with me. +++$+++ 1970s
Since you were a child? +++$+++ 1970s
Now, children, no fighting -- save that for the office. Let's have our dance. +++$+++ 1930s
What's any of that got to do with Paul D.? +++$+++ 1990s
Let's not talk about that. How'd you get home? +++$+++ 1990s
Two officers have been assigned to the case. I can't keep them on indefinitely, but we'll go through every lead. +++$+++ 1970s
That's unique. +++$+++ 2000s
Sir, I'm flattered that you even recognize my name. My God, I had no idea you were in Hollywood. +++$+++ 1990s
Why. +++$+++ 1980s
You were right -- and I was wrong. There!  Did you ever think you'd hear me say that?  Spectacularly wrong. Instead of observing those animals, I tried to control them.  I squandered an opportunity and we still know next to nothing about their lives.  Not their lives as man would have them, behind electric fences, but in the wild.  Behavior in their natural habitat, the impossible dream of any paleontologist.  I could have had it, but I let it slip away.  Thank God for Site B. +++$+++ 1990s
I have a professional relationship with Rachel Banks. She's the go- between for a private investigator I use. +++$+++ 1990s
You weren't mad at him for picking up the phone? +++$+++ 1990s
It's all right, George.  It's cool. Just wait here, all right?  I'll be back in a coupla minutes. +++$+++ 1980s
What about the game?! +++$+++ 1990s
Maybe you should have just a half. +++$+++ 1990s
Everybody else is buying the minor stroke'  story... +++$+++ 1990s
What? +++$+++ 1950s
You wanna go downtown and discuss this officially? +++$+++ 1990s
I didn't see you there. Can I help you? +++$+++ 1990s
I hear he didn't mean to.  The cop fell as Dillinger was aiming at his leg and got him through the heart. +++$+++ 1990s
Yeah.  But not for long. +++$+++ 1990s
Not too far, I hope. +++$+++ 1990s
Sweeter than bee pollen on a summer wind. +++$+++ 1980s
Martin Van Buren Aldrich and my Pa's the only Democrat in Cross Corners. He said you had horns and a tall, Mr. Webster, but I ain't seen 'em yet. +++$+++ 2000s
Cut it out, will you? Just cut it out and come back here. +++$+++ 1990s
Hey, Ros, where are they? +++$+++ 2000s
What is it this time? +++$+++ 1990s
Hell, they hardly even noticed us. +++$+++ 2000s
Oh, you... +++$+++ 2000s
... Whew!  I'm glad that's over with. +++$+++ 1970s
Here's one! +++$+++ 1970s
I'm not hungry. I can't eat nothin', I haven't been able to eat since I got fired. I think maybe I'm sick. +++$+++ 1990s
I found sand. I saw death. +++$+++ 1990s
Aye, let's try the dressing room. +++$+++ 1960s
Do your job, man, don't tell me to dance. +++$+++ 1990s
Do you remember where it is? +++$+++ 2000s
Like I had a choice with that anal-retentive Jon Archer rising my ass at the probation hearing.  At least he took an interest. You took off without leaving so much as a Post-it. +++$+++ 1990s
Is that what you want to do? +++$+++ 1940s
I said no touching. +++$+++ 2000s
Big threat. TV would ream you. +++$+++ 1970s
That's what I would have done. +++$+++ 2000s
I didn't say nothin', Boss. +++$+++ 1960s
-please- you needn't be so graphic- +++$+++ 1990s
That sudden? +++$+++ 1960s
Yes. I'm all over that now. Jack, hold on a minute. There's someone here who wants to talk to you... +++$+++ 1990s
Was it <u>every</u> day or just semi- weekly you got your ass kicked as a kid? +++$+++ 2000s
And I... love you... +++$+++ 1980s
And they will be again, Spock. That's the beauty of it.  How much? +++$+++ 1980s
Jesus.  Well, I do too, sometimes... +++$+++ 1990s
Leave at once -- +++$+++ 2000s
Trust me. You've got the equipment, you just need to read the manual. +++$+++ 2000s
Shut up.  I don't feel like dying today. +++$+++ 2000s
Gus, Webco, the Webster industrial complex, is a family-owned cartel. A little magnesium here, a little zinc there. Some railroads here, some farm machinery there. You follow? +++$+++ 1980s
It's not that simple. You have to be careful. There's another guy that comes along, a hard-on you owe some money to. A mob guy. Wants to take you out anyway, on account of a past situation. +++$+++ 1990s
Of course. +++$+++ 1990s
All right, all right!  Hope you figure this out, folks. +++$+++ 1960s
Yes -- what is it? +++$+++ 1990s
Yeah, you bet! +++$+++ 1940s
Doctor, what's wrong? +++$+++ 1960s
I love you! 1 want to marry you! +++$+++ 1990s
No. +++$+++ 2000s
You mean that leaves Miss Hall. +++$+++ 2000s
Hey ninety five point three percent of all murders are committed by either a spouse, a direct relative or a close friend that's common knowledge. But this wasn't murder it was an accident- +++$+++ 2000s
Take your boots off.  You're tan. +++$+++ 2000s
Yes, I know. My first concern is to locate the lucky man. When I do, it's your job to keep the newspapers away from him. +++$+++ 1930s
Are the labs in operation? +++$+++ 2000s
What do I tell them? +++$+++ 2000s
Well, let's see -- there was that moment, when I had a train on top of my head -- +++$+++ 2000s
I don't believe you, Eddie. I think you're still a loser. +++$+++ 1960s
I've been doing nothing I shouldn't, sir. The millicents have nothing on me, brother, sir, I mean. Deltoid pulls Alex down on the bed. +++$+++ 1970s
Honey, she won't d... +++$+++ 1990s
No! Don't! Please! +++$+++ 1970s
I can subpoena you, you know.  I can get you up there on the stand. +++$+++ 1970s
Be polite. Say hello.  This is Candy. +++$+++ 1980s
You want me to leave? +++$+++ 1960s
With all the meteor activity in this system, it's going to be difficult to spot approaching ships. +++$+++ 1980s
I'll take my chances. +++$+++ 1990s
Thing is...I think I'm in love with her. +++$+++ 1980s
How does the distress signal look? +++$+++ 1990s
This came for you today. I presume on your request. +++$+++ 1990s
How the hell should I know how much? +++$+++ 1990s
Sonny...Sonny--Jesus Christ, I'm down at the hospital.  I came down late.  There's no one here.  None of Tessio's people--no detectives, no one.  The old man is completely unprotected. +++$+++ 1970s
God yes, Allie. I've gotta say -- that was the ballsiest move I ever... +++$+++ 1980s
What are you <u>doing</u> here? +++$+++ 1990s
Oh, I studied the guitar. I had to give it up. Gave me calluses on my fingers. As an actress I can't afford to have a tarnished instrument. +++$+++ 1970s
You mean it's a girls' band? +++$+++ 1950s
Aye. +++$+++ 1990s
Okay, let's drop it.  I didn't mean I'd take a test for you -- I mean if that came up in conversation I'd... +++$+++ 1980s
Hello, Claire.  How extraordinary that you came. +++$+++ 1980s
Of course. +++$+++ 1990s
It's your heart--you ought to take it with you. +++$+++ 1990s
A boy or a girl? +++$+++ 1970s
I'm very, very serious. +++$+++ 1940s
Heather, what is it? +++$+++ 1990s
Alan Stanwyk. +++$+++ 1980s
Yeah... yeah. +++$+++ 1970s
I gotta see new comedians later, I've gotta-- +++$+++ 1980s
But you don't know where he is. +++$+++ 1980s
Tomorrow night, before a crowd of fifteen thousand people, and talking over a nation-wide radio hook-up, John Doe will announce the formation of a third party. +++$+++ 1940s
Yes. +++$+++ 1990s
You didn't even open my present and I'm your daughter. +++$+++ 1940s
I think about you. I mean, a lot. +++$+++ 1990s
Terrible! Nothing terrible about her. She's great! Marvelous youngster! Got a mind of her own. Knows just what she wants.  She's not going to get it though. She won't get very far. Has no money. +++$+++ 1930s
What do they do that they had to kill her? +++$+++ 2000s
Sorry, didn't mean to -- +++$+++ 1990s
Oh. My. God. I can't believe you're here. Welcome. Can I just tell you, I am so excited right now. +++$+++ 2000s
Coughing opens up the capillaries. When you cough, you're getting air -- in this case smoke -- to parts of the lung that don't normally get used. Coughing's good -- gets ya higher. My dad coughs when he smokes all the time. +++$+++ 1990s
That's right. +++$+++ 1980s
I'm telling you. Wait three days... +++$+++ 1990s
Let's synchronize the watches. Eleven forty-two, sharp. +++$+++ 1950s
Three minutes. +++$+++ 1980s
Come and get you! Shit! It's a damn half hour drive each way. Why didn't you talk to me about it first? +++$+++ 1990s
Absolutely. +++$+++ 1970s
She said she was in Arizona, did she? +++$+++ 2000s
Twenty years of counselling you see a lot of-- +++$+++ 1990s
Well, I can't, sweetheart. +++$+++ 1990s
What's the big idea, Sefton? Take that telescope out of here. +++$+++ 1950s
-- a job. +++$+++ 1980s
...Aren't you skating? +++$+++ 1970s
Please yourself. +++$+++ 1980s
But I'm a robber and a manslaughterer and I haven't had any parental guidance. +++$+++ 1990s
As a matter of fact he does. +++$+++ 1990s
No. When I say the word "pretty," when I say the word "pleasure," what is the earliest memory you see? +++$+++ 2000s
I don't know. We'll figure it out. +++$+++ 1990s
Oh, Brother, I am so disappointed in you. You mustn't look at those horrible things, they degrade the human image. +++$+++ 1990s
Let the law -- +++$+++ 2000s
Did you see Hiromix last night dancing with Bambi? +++$+++ 2000s
We brought your laundry, Miss Boatwright. +++$+++ 1970s
Know what a turtle is? +++$+++ 1980s
Don't give it a thought.  Only three million dollars a month! +++$+++ 1950s
Course, she settled down nicely. +++$+++ 1970s
Yeah!  We're hot entertainment, right?  You got me and Sal on TV ... we're entertainment you sell, right? +++$+++ 1970s
You the magician? +++$+++ 1980s
She ate. +++$+++ 1990s
It's a fax from Sports Illustrated from Ben Isaacson, Michael's boss. +++$+++ 1990s
I can't do that, Ralph, because somebody already brushed her off once tonight. +++$+++ 1950s
How would you like to gargle rat jiz? +++$+++ 1990s
No, no.  That won't do. +++$+++ 1980s
I don't know... too late to stop it. +++$+++ 1980s
Because when we get down there -- +++$+++ 1990s
What'the fuck is that? +++$+++ 1990s
What I mean is ... Mary Sue's been a little "different" lately ... +++$+++ 1990s
You're a fucking dead man-- +++$+++ 1990s
Oh, thankyou, your honour. The Tramp takes a second look at Alex. +++$+++ 1970s
Over eight years of some of the hardest raging experiences of my life. +++$+++ 1990s
Okay. +++$+++ 1990s
KIMBALL. +++$+++ 2000s
Blasé and epicene. +++$+++ 1980s
Why do you keep lying to me?					 * +++$+++ 2000s
Why not? +++$+++ 2000s
Hey, you dealt us this hand, we're playing it all the way. Move. +++$+++ 1990s
Don't cry, Elizabeth. +++$+++ 1930s
We'd better adjust our streams. +++$+++ 1980s
When he moved down to Venice he had to go door-to-door to tell everyone he's a pederast. +++$+++ 1990s
...why? +++$+++ 2000s
Max... Your BILLY shirt's on fire... +++$+++ 1970s
--according to sources involved in the Watergate investigation. Beginning in the spring of 1971-- +++$+++ 1970s
Mighty good of you to come out, Squire -- sparing all this time to --  Sheriff, too -- and Schoolmaster -- mighty nice. +++$+++ 2000s
It's not safe. +++$+++ 2000s
Don't you believe in knocking? +++$+++ 1980s
Make them go faster, Mr.... ? +++$+++ 2000s
Who knows?  All I've ever heard her say is that she'd dip before dating a guy that smokes. +++$+++ 1990s
It's a very moving experience, trust me. +++$+++ 2000s
No, no, no, no, no, no. Wait. +++$+++ 1990s
You know that if you come, we gotta invite Maranzano. +++$+++ 1990s
No, I wouldn't be surprised at anything from you. Winningly. MAXWELL Now, honey--you are here in time to help me and you can-- +++$+++ 1980s
I've had many... when the sea doesn't want you. +++$+++ 1980s
Just a visit with my old pal, Jay-bird. +++$+++ 2000s
Ambassador, I -- I had no idea you were here...  I think you know my crew... +++$+++ 1980s
Put me down, you son of a bitch! +++$+++ 1990s
Well, I thought it was safe-- +++$+++ 1980s
Let's get some coffee and talk. +++$+++ 1990s
And you have no idea where he lives? +++$+++ 1990s
Anything else I can get you? +++$+++ 2000s
Felt a little light. +++$+++ 2000s
So you felt it too! +++$+++ 1990s
"Dear Diane, I'll always be there for you, all the love in my heart, Lloyd."  I've never gotten a letter like this, have you? +++$+++ 1980s
But Al is your husband now! +++$+++ 1990s
I figured you might like some help. +++$+++ 1980s
We've already done this. +++$+++ 1990s
No, it can't.  Good night, darling. +++$+++ 1940s
Ryan's novel. +++$+++ 2000s
Yeah, it'll be fun. +++$+++ 2000s
What about you? +++$+++ 1990s
It's not a good idea, Hallie. +++$+++ 1990s
Waddaya doing New Year's Eve? +++$+++ 1950s
You've probably never done an honorable thing in your life. +++$+++ 1980s
You'll be fine.  No matter what Leo Kubelsky says, you've got a hundred and seventy-five years of American law on your side.  Don't forget that. +++$+++ 2000s
Four.  Wow.  What a big boy.  I love you, Sean. +++$+++ 2000s
C'est tres amusant... You have been promoted. And to a Jew... I am joking of course. Naturellement. Seriously, Nick, may I hope that you have come to play? +++$+++ 1970s
So, what's up with you?  Another busy night selling porno to wireheads? +++$+++ 1990s
We miss you at the Bureau. Abe's crazier every day. And Father's still mad at me --  Come back, Liz. Come back. I -- +++$+++ 2000s
I know.  Just did what you had to. That banner and stuff, that's Just Ike.  Don't worry about it. +++$+++ 1990s
Let's see...do you know her cup size? +++$+++ 1990s
Good, because I checked your salary -- and it bites.  How the everyday working-class stiff survives in today's economy is something I'll never ... +++$+++ 1990s
Hey, you didn't fuck it up with me.  You know that.  It was my fault, babe, it really was.  And you know I'm sorry. And I'm sorry to see you upset now.  I hate to see you in pain like this. +++$+++ 1990s
I gotta go to the bathroom. +++$+++ 1990s
Okay? +++$+++ 1990s
Last night? What are you talking about, Ray? +++$+++ 2000s
So you shall be... Like our brothers, the hawk and the wolf, our spirits know no master... we are created in the pure image of the savage God that set our turbulent universe in motion. +++$+++ 1980s
Chain saws. +++$+++ 2000s
Do you know what's in this archive? +++$+++ 2000s
Johnny! +++$+++ 1950s
Mrs.  Otto,  there is no such thing as an accident.  The word doesn't mean anything to me.  As far as I'm concerned, somebody somewhere made a decision to cut a corner.  Some corrupt agency or corporation accounted the cost variance between a ten-cent bolt and a million dollar out-of-court settlement.  They decided to sacrifice a few lives for the difference.  That's what's done, Mrs. Otto.  I've seen it happen so many times before. +++$+++ 1990s
Okay.  So I had this...thought, and...this may seem like it's out of left field, and I don't know if you can, but since I'm not going with anyone -- +++$+++ 1990s
No.  Right here on the beach.  Come on. Let's do it. +++$+++ 2000s
Shhhhhh. +++$+++ 2000s
I handle most of Cardiff Giant's stuff. +++$+++ 2000s
MM.? +++$+++ 1980s
Lucked out -- got voice mail. Everything's cool. +++$+++ 2000s
That was easy, wasn't it? +++$+++ 1990s
Please... please thank the governing committee for me. I will do my utmost to merit their kindness. +++$+++ 1980s
The boats are all going. +++$+++ 1990s
You know, if you wanted, we could take a look at those seismographs for her. +++$+++ 1990s
What the hell do you mean going out and leaving Regan by her self! What are you kidding her window's wide open... +++$+++ 1970s
Alright... +++$+++ 2000s
I'm Bureau for 28 years, Starling. I won't disobey orders, not even now. +++$+++ 1990s
What else wasn't there? +++$+++ 1970s
Come on!  I won't tell. +++$+++ 1990s
Yes? +++$+++ 1990s
Up all night again, huh? +++$+++ 1990s
What the hell do you think's the matter.  I could wait for you someplace. +++$+++ 1970s
You've been avoiding me. +++$+++ 1990s
Uh, his birthday, uh, May.  I think. +++$+++ 1990s
Go learn something. +++$+++ 2000s
Actually, no. Adam was switching to a Whole Life Policy, but re-scheduled his medical exam...and failed to make his last payment...so his Term Life lapsed. So it's value is null and void.  Now he did have a pension account, worth another 150 thousand. +++$+++ 1990s
Oh.  I can't. +++$+++ 1990s
You mean the one the dog was sniffing around? +++$+++ 1950s
No, depends on nothing. +++$+++ 1990s
That's impossible, man!  Okay, Clark, out of the john where I can see you! +++$+++ 1980s
I'm sorry.  If there was any other- +++$+++ 1990s
When I was a little girl.  Three or four. If I had a nightmare, I'd bring my Dad in. The dream would always get better.  He always used to tell me about it the next day -- he used to think they were his dreams. NANCY When did it stop? +++$+++ 1980s
Not really. I'd say that Gordon is one of the most astute collectors around. He has a great eye and he only buys the best. Like this rug for instance, a silk Tabriz, the finest of its kind. The day after he bought it in London, a dealer representing the Saudi Royal Family offered him twice what he paid. It absolutely makes the room. See how this little bit of celadon in the border is picked up in the cushions oh the sofa... although...  I don't know if I would have used that tea dipped linen for the upholstery - too dingy. And it's a sacrilege having that Pre-Columbian pot in the center of the coffee table. Some dope might use it as an ashtray. +++$+++ 1980s
You listen to me, someday you might say, "Hey..." No, fuck that, you just listen what I'm going to say: your partner depends on you.  Your partner...a man who's your "partner" depends on you...you have to go with him and for him...or you're shit, you're shit, you can't exist alone... +++$+++ 1990s
I went. I did. I took my mother and little brother. +++$+++ 1990s
Selectman? Selectman of the village? Me? +++$+++ 2000s
I had it at four. +++$+++ 2000s
Well, I'd best be off. +++$+++ 1940s
She. +++$+++ 1990s
Maybe your marriage should lay off grains for a while. +++$+++ 1980s
It's about life. +++$+++ 2000s
Yes. I flooded my school... and I burned down that pervert's house. I think I only have a few days left... before they catch me. +++$+++ 2000s
Zeena... +++$+++ 2000s
John... +++$+++ 1990s
Yeah, I can see that.  I guess the only thing that confused me is - - not that your medical problems aren't important, but -- how come the files about them are in with all the real estate stuff? +++$+++ 2000s
You wanna drink? +++$+++ 1960s
Sort of like a new hobby, huh, General? +++$+++ 1960s
At least I can explain that, Mary. Your sister had a feeling about life —— that it wasn't worth living unless one could end it. I helped her get that room. +++$+++ 1940s
Shut up.  West's dead. +++$+++ 2000s
I was stoned. That's why they stopped me. When I'm not stoned, I got no place else to go. They just protect me from myself. +++$+++ 1970s
A cure? +++$+++ 1990s
You need to get better first Trevor. Way better.  It's okay to miss somebody. It's okay to still love someone after they're gone. But you've got to quit blaming yourself okay...? Okay? +++$+++ 2000s
I'm not playin' myself no mo'. +++$+++ 2000s
Well, sounds like me. Sorry, man.  Says you were jealous and suspicious. +++$+++ 2000s
I vote for me. +++$+++ 1980s
His wife had twins and he went out to celebrate and got as drunk as a lord. They can't even find him.  I tell you, drink is the ruin of this nation. +++$+++ 1940s
The girl's dryin' up! She's gotta live a little before her body dries up!! You're a pal, Rock -- How 'bout yo' talk to her? Y'know, it's Thanksgivin' tomorrow. +++$+++ 1970s
For trying to impose some decency on that sort. +++$+++ 2000s
I must speak to you, Miss Flaemm -- business. +++$+++ 1930s
You do what you want. You want to leave... You want to go kill yourself? +++$+++ 1980s
So my associate Mr. Marco tells me you may be interested in investing in a motion picture. +++$+++ 1990s
Probably you're right, but a little while ago, I was talking to a couple of lawyers who'd been assigned to represent the burglars. +++$+++ 1970s
She said you were a son of a bitch and she regrets the day she set eyes on you. +++$+++ 1990s
Oh, sh- +++$+++ 1990s
Same sector. Metallic mass. +++$+++ 1980s
I think she covered you with the parasites. +++$+++ 1930s
I have too much work to do. Skip the treatment. +++$+++ 1990s
I'm missing something. +++$+++ 1990s
Found?  I'm not some charity case. +++$+++ 2000s
I'm not going to say anything -- to Marge, or anybody, the police -- It's a secret between us and I'll keep it. +++$+++ 1990s
Stop tearing me apart!  You say one thing and he says another and then everybody changes back-- +++$+++ 1950s
Out getting coffee. +++$+++ 1990s
Who cares?!  You hired an actor?? +++$+++ 1990s
A paper? +++$+++ 2000s
Everybody's good-looking, Patrick. +++$+++ 2000s
Sister, we all know what happened to you yesterday morning. I expected that you would want to speak to me about it. But you could have come to my office. Your being here, in the confessional, implies that you, Sister, have done something wrong. You haven't. I assure you. I feared you might have misplaced feelings of guilt. If you condemn yourself because you experienced feelings of... curiosity or even... pleasure, you mustn't -- +++$+++ 1990s
They can look forward to that. +++$+++ 1990s
She's on the North Head Bluff - approaching the cliffs.  One klick away. +++$+++ 2000s
Your compliment was sufficient Luis. +++$+++ 2000s
No. +++$+++ 1980s
You are an imperfect being... created by an imperfect being. Finding your weakness is only a matter of time. +++$+++ 1990s
I figured I'd ask you... +++$+++ 1980s
This is Lila Crane, from Phoenix. She's been here for a few days, looking for her sister. There's a private detective helping... and, well, we got a call tonight, from this detective, saying he'd traced Mary... +++$+++ 1960s
You see, a tree is a living thing. +++$+++ 1980s
Car trouble? +++$+++ 1980s
Sir, you haven't logged a single star hour in two and a half years. That, plus your unfamiliarity with the ship's design -- in my opinion, sir, seriously jeopardizes our mission. +++$+++ 1970s
There's something in Constantinople... something irresistible.... +++$+++ 1930s
Reckon we better begin roustin' 'em out if we aim to get outa here by daylight. How about it, John? How you boys comin'? +++$+++ 1940s
Minnie Pearl. +++$+++ 1990s
When do you need it? +++$+++ 1980s
I still don't either, even after all these years. +++$+++ 2000s
Okay. +++$+++ 1980s
This is all terribly wrong. +++$+++ 1960s
He won't make love to me anymore. +++$+++ 1980s
The Vatican is made of constant mysteries meant to be enjoyed, not explained. +++$+++ 1990s
Sure you are, sport. +++$+++ 2000s
I've studied the case file, have you...? Everything you need to find him is right in these pages. Whatever his name is. +++$+++ 1990s
We met on the beach. +++$+++ 1980s
Make sure you're here by noon - we have tons of stuff to do... Oh yeah! I have to show you something else! +++$+++ 2000s
Well, you didn't appreciate the severity of it until recently.  No question about that. +++$+++ 2000s
Hide us Uncle Birdie! He's a-comin' with his knife! +++$+++ 1950s
Yeah, sure... very funny.... +++$+++ 2000s
You make it sound like a prison sentence. +++$+++ 1990s
Nothing R, okay? +++$+++ 2000s
Never mind.  Do they have that knowledge? +++$+++ 1980s
Yeah, intensive care ward.  My God-hey, Max, I think she's... I think she's giving me the eye. +++$+++ 1970s
Will you stop and tell me what's wrong? +++$+++ 1980s
Put it in your pants. +++$+++ 1990s
Castor's escaped! +++$+++ 1990s
Telly. +++$+++ 1990s
It's also the major piece of evidence, and it makes you a key part of his plan.  You can't run away from it anymore.  Look at the order he's doing them... He did three as the Boston Strangler just to tell us a copycat serial killer was at work.  Then he did one like the Hillside Strang- ler.  And then one as Son of Sam. To lead us on -- to where and what end?  And he's doing more than that -- he's imitating each killer's method as closely as he can -- in details.  Injecting Windex.  Using .44.  Playing Abba. +++$+++ 1990s
The legend goes that you release the power with the power. +++$+++ 1990s
Please, God.  Let this be it. +++$+++ 1990s
I saw him on T.V.  Some kid got possessed and he saved the little bastard's life. +++$+++ 1990s
I don't know.  I'll go and sort it out today. Why don't you come?... We'll find a real room for me. You can pick it out, a tower on the strip. +++$+++ 1990s
We were friends. I trusted him. I should have known it was weird. But, then again I was weird. +++$+++ 2000s
Yeah, my dad's great.  He took me to the zoo. +++$+++ 1990s
Dunn. +++$+++ 1980s
Five hours.  We both just know.  Do you think I deserve to wear white? +++$+++ 1980s
I'm sorry sir, we need your debit card before we can issue a credit -- +++$+++ 1920s
Her phone's probably tapped. +++$+++ 1990s
Jake, I mean, come on -- +++$+++ 2000s
Really? +++$+++ 1990s
What are you doing? +++$+++ 2000s
Goodnight. +++$+++ 1960s
There's more! +++$+++ 1990s
Maybe you better have a Black Russian. +++$+++ 1980s
There were 24 kidnappings in Mexico City in the last six days. Four a day. What do you think about that, Mr. Creasy? +++$+++ 2000s
He stole the contract knowing that I would come after him. +++$+++ 1990s
So all of our intel was bogus to begin with. +++$+++ 2000s
Rizzo, he's out there. +++$+++ 2000s
No. No, you definitely cannot do that, Mark. That's a big, fat sack of no! +++$+++ 2000s
Probably best not tell anyone about this. +++$+++ 1990s
You'd look naked without one. +++$+++ 1980s
We checked the manifest. Everyone was accounted for. +++$+++ 1990s
STOP IT! I DID SO KILL THEM! And I'm going to kill Anastasia. +++$+++ 1990s
What. +++$+++ 1990s
And I ain't no nigger either! +++$+++ 1990s
What are you doing here!? +++$+++ 1990s
Who? +++$+++ 1980s
He didn't join them. They joined him. +++$+++ 1980s
You're good enough you'll never have to kill anyone.  I joined the cops to save lives, not waste them. +++$+++ 1990s
Tha's your problem. +++$+++ 1970s
Why not? ... Oh wow, she doesn't know you're here. In fact, you're grounded. Jesus, you could get in a shitload of trouble for this. I think I should call her anyway. +++$+++ 1990s
Yeah. +++$+++ 1970s
Correct me if I'm wrong - WE! Because when I'm out on this very slippery limb for you, you have to know what's involved. +++$+++ 1950s
Try the spicy tuna hand roll. +++$+++ 1990s
Sir, how about souvenirs? +++$+++ 1970s
It's actually a very beautiful thing, and look there wouldn't have been a Vada. +++$+++ 1990s
Goddamnit!  D'you tell him we need it right now? +++$+++ 1980s
Once he locked himself in the bathroom and your grandfather had to get the ladder and climb in through the window.... +++$+++ 1980s
Well, you're gonna have to take your best shot. +++$+++ 1980s
Shit, shit, shit, shit, shit. +++$+++ 1990s
Will Senator Smith yield to--? +++$+++ 1930s
But what is this -- why? +++$+++ 1970s
Your lip bleeding? +++$+++ 1990s
You missed him! +++$+++ 1980s
No, actually I was thinking of becoming a brain surgeon. +++$+++ 1970s
Uh-huh. Some beat, huh? +++$+++ 2000s
We get to the bridge, we're all right! +++$+++ 2000s
Mmmmnph...I'll get you a cab... +++$+++ 1970s
Oh yeah. What about those other people? Anything? +++$+++ 1980s
Thank you.  I appreciate it.  I can't reciprocate. +++$+++ 2000s
Say not here!  Cuba! +++$+++ 1990s
My notes.  Observations.  Clues. +++$+++ 1990s
Yes.  How did you know? +++$+++ 1990s
You might be the only one with a job. +++$+++ 2000s
Have you got a pen? +++$+++ 1990s
Christ! You do know it all! +++$+++ 1980s
The coppers blamed me for everything that went wrong out here, and I mean every little fuckin' thing too. +++$+++ 1990s
Oh, I'm fine.  They've replaced you with quite an entourage.  It's a regular "marching band".  You should see me on the street, you'd think I was the First Lady -- +++$+++ 1980s
No!   Don't!  Lasher!!! +++$+++ 1990s
The bachelor party's upstairs. They made me get naked. They hung me from the window so high up it was so scary I fell down... +++$+++ 1980s
Mmm ... what are you doing? +++$+++ 1990s
-- By way of my breasts? +++$+++ 2000s
The Soul of the House. Everything that's corrupt about it... My father trapped it in there just before he died. You see, he purchased the house to restore it... We were going to live here... Nothing can live here. I was just a kid... The first time I saw it, I thought it was beautiful... It was just a dark mist turning into the corner of the room... then it started to move... then death started to happen... First the workers.. six in all... then my father... +++$+++ 1990s
Sure, anything you want. +++$+++ 1980s
So you did fuck up. +++$+++ 1990s
Where's Mary? +++$+++ 1940s
Ask him. +++$+++ 1990s
Michael, it sounds like a wonderful opportun... +++$+++ 1990s
Right. +++$+++ 1990s
And what do you mean barging in here and taking up my valuable time! I've got a company to run here -- +++$+++ 1990s
No. +++$+++ 1990s
Come on Mr. Parker. +++$+++ 1990s
SHOWGIRLS. Absolutely frightening. What's yours? Wait, let me guess. THE HOUSE ON SORORITY ROW? FINAL EXAM. GRADUATION DAY? THE DORM THAT DRIPPED BLOOD? SPLATTER UNIVERSITY? Am I close? +++$+++ 1990s
You've got to eat something. You're just nervous about going over to see if you're Diane Selwyn. +++$+++ 2000s
No. +++$+++ 1970s
No one. I promise. +++$+++ 1990s
No, sir.  I've never seen this guy before. +++$+++ 1990s
So lay it off to somebody else. +++$+++ 1990s
But of course. +++$+++ 1970s
I'm not a fool, Billy. +++$+++ 1990s
I don't know.  But as a scientist I have to consider that possibility. +++$+++ 1990s
Yes. +++$+++ 1980s
What?  How about a drink? +++$+++ 1990s
What do you want? +++$+++ 1980s
But, Doctor, surely in a case like this -- a child -- a little child who can never walk or run -- +++$+++ 1940s
Don't let your eyes go from the beginning of the sentence to the end like that.  You don't want to look shifty, do you? +++$+++ 1980s
What a sweet little picture.  Mommy and Daddy aren't losing a daughter, they're gaining a eunuch! +++$+++ 1990s
I know it's a dream. +++$+++ 2000s
Brad... +++$+++ 1970s
Must have taken a hell of a long time. +++$+++ 2000s
Where's the radio? +++$+++ 1980s
Only everything... +++$+++ 1970s
What do you mean? +++$+++ 1970s
Looks like a chipmunk. +++$+++ 2000s
...And for our young men on the field of battle, that they may return home to their dear ones... +++$+++ 1970s
You could. It'd be a waste of your time, though. +++$+++ 2000s
Oh yeah? How exciting. What's it called? +++$+++ 2000s
What do you expect me to do?  What in the world - +++$+++ 1940s
Who is it? +++$+++ 2000s
You just have to control it. We're not apes. +++$+++ 2000s
Have a great time, honey! +++$+++ 1990s
I hate to see you cringe in front of him.  How come you're so scared of your own kid brother? +++$+++ 1970s
I... I... +++$+++ 1980s
I don't know-like two-thirty, three. +++$+++ 1990s
No, he didn't. +++$+++ 1990s
Who is it? +++$+++ 1990s
Your love. +++$+++ 1980s
Let me tell you something about boys.  They're like weeds.  They grow best when they're ignored. +++$+++ 1980s
Sam, your life is going wrong - let your friends tell you - Records is a dead end department, no Security Level worth a damn, it's impossible to get noticed - +++$+++ 1980s
Don't you touch it. +++$+++ 1990s
You haven't heard from Rashid, have you? +++$+++ 1990s
A young Albanian Girl, dressed in their... +++$+++ 1990s
That's stupid. +++$+++ 1990s
Baldwin. The blushing bridegroom -- himself. +++$+++ 1940s
Could be meant as a warning. +++$+++ 2000s
No she's not. Don't you get it, ya lunk? She's using code language to the studio bosses. "Bedraggled foreigners and swarthy refugees" -- who the hell do you think she's talking about? +++$+++ 1990s
What's your story? +++$+++ 1970s
You know, this isn't gonna end well, these things never do. +++$+++ 1990s
You did? A human ear? +++$+++ 1980s
You're my hero, Carl. +++$+++ 1990s
Second verse! +++$+++ 2000s
A great warrior?  Not many on those.  Wars don't make one great. +++$+++ 1980s
I'm dizzy and thirsty. +++$+++ 2000s
I . . . can't . . . argue . . . +++$+++ 1970s
I'll be there in three days--four at the most. I've got to get the electricity shut off and square things with your school so the truant officer ain't after you, and-- +++$+++ 1980s
You haven't heard? Andy's dead. +++$+++ 1990s
If they think you're not trying, you're in trouble. First hint of that, they'll be on to the DSS, 'This cunt's no trying' and your Giro is fucking finished, right? +++$+++ 1990s
How much time? +++$+++ 1990s
If the Other Side ever gets hold of a thing like that... +++$+++ 1960s
Nothing has changed, I assure you both. The Army still thinks we got Elvis.  They had a tactical withdrawal.  It's just those two amateurs now.  Do you really want to concede a hundred million dollars to them? +++$+++ 1990s
Uh... Bob. Like to speak to you. Take a minute. +++$+++ 1980s
Can't remember the last time I saw you in that suit. +++$+++ 2000s
Where you at? +++$+++ 1990s
Forever together. +++$+++ 1990s
Enterprise would be unable to function <U>without</U> carbon units. +++$+++ 1970s
This is so unfair. +++$+++ 2000s
How did you know that? +++$+++ 1980s
Ben, I'm afraid I've got to ask -- +++$+++ 1990s
I can't even stand to talk to her on the phone. +++$+++ 1970s
You mean because What's-His-Name. +++$+++ 2000s
He'll replace you, too- that's all you really care about. +++$+++ 1990s
...a history of <u>nothing</u>, he was acquitted... +++$+++ 2000s
I'm not painting the fu --, I'm not painting the ashtray. And frogs aren't purple. +++$+++ 2000s
I got a kid, you know.  I'm a person, for Chrissake. +++$+++ 1990s
I've been hired as an independent contractor by the U.S. Resource Center for Missing Persons as part of an internal audit.  If you have any time over the next few days, I'd like to make an appointment to ask some questions about the disappearance of your daughter. +++$+++ 1990s
...easy, easy, easy. +++$+++ 1990s
I know, Dickson. That's all very well. But you're taking too many chances. In these times a bank should keep liquid in case of trouble. In case of emergency! +++$+++ 1930s
It's also called getting me this close to being murdered. +++$+++ 1980s
Come on tough guy. Listen to me.  You are going to tell Lois that it was all an accident. Okay cowboy? You got me? +++$+++ 1990s
She never particularly cared for me. +++$+++ 2000s
Meaning what? +++$+++ 1930s
Beam them directly to Sickbay. +++$+++ 1990s
To collect my fee. +++$+++ 1990s
How you doin'?  Hi there! +++$+++ 1960s
Sal, get 'em in the vault. +++$+++ 1970s
I was afraid of that. +++$+++ 1950s
Nigger. +++$+++ 2000s
...get 'em, he's going to start shooting hostages in five minutes... +++$+++ 1990s
... he'd just found out about Track 2. +++$+++ 1990s
Sure. +++$+++ 1970s
Alright.  We're going up. +++$+++ 1990s
It was a shame. +++$+++ 1990s
I'm sorry. +++$+++ 2000s
Guess that makes you pretty special. +++$+++ 2000s
What about us? What about me? +++$+++ 1990s
Mr. Appleton, I have reason to believe you're holding something back, and that just rubs me the wrong way.  Sir, are you a communist? +++$+++ 2000s
You really like that bitch don't you? I gotta tell you, I was pretty convinced that the whole thing before was blowing her off for her cut. You know how it is, get her to do some shit for you, throw her a bang to keep her happy. But, if you're into her... That's cool. +++$+++ 2000s
I dropped her at home. +++$+++ 2000s
Hey! He looks . . . normal. +++$+++ 1980s
... You know, Chauncey... I want us to be...  I want us... You and I to become... close... I want us to become very close, you know...? +++$+++ 1970s
Still, please. +++$+++ 1990s
Oh, all the great writers -- Shakespeare, Charles Dickens, Moby Dick... those people. Each is bound in genuine premium leather with 22 carat gold accents. It's a magnificent set -- and only $33.50 per volume. Right away you get Great Expectations for just $6.99. +++$+++ 1990s
It is easy to be sarcastic about religion. It is harder to take small hints from God, your feelings and listen to them... to take a stand. +++$+++ 1990s
Pleasure to meet you.  I've seen you on television. +++$+++ 1980s
I counted to three, honey. +++$+++ 2000s
Stop it, Jack. +++$+++ 1980s
Excuse me, Mr. Coccotti.  Do you know Nick Cardella? +++$+++ 1990s
I used to sing with male bands. But I can't afford it any more. +++$+++ 1950s
Hurry up -- the salad's getting warm and the pasta's getting cold. +++$+++ 1990s
Yeah. Just babies. +++$+++ 1930s
No, man, I'm doing okay. Thanks. +++$+++ 1990s
Well, he's in trouble and he didn't even get here yet. +++$+++ 1980s
But you haven't put in for emigration. +++$+++ 1980s
When it killed Sean it was like a stab in the heart.  I knew with absolute certainty that it had come for him. I knew that.  I know it's coming.... +++$+++ 1980s
Well, did you get a job out of it at least? +++$+++ 1970s
Say "goodnight" to Sandy. +++$+++ 1990s
Then let's go see what they missed. +++$+++ 2000s
We gotta get to Hector!! +++$+++ 1990s
Have they found my father? +++$+++ 1990s
Thought it was my week for that. +++$+++ 1990s
Did you see them? Did you see how they came? +++$+++ 1950s
What did you say? +++$+++ 2000s
OK...county tax records...they're saying 1490 Breckinridge is owned by... an Atlantic Trust Corporation...they have a P.O. box in D.C. +++$+++ 2000s
You are lately come to Scotland, Joseph? +++$+++ 1940s
Gone out with you. She woulda like rearranged your tonsils. +++$+++ 1990s
Shut up. +++$+++ 1990s
Well, then, what is it you exactly want to do? +++$+++ 1970s
Aren't you coming? +++$+++ 1990s
Come on. +++$+++ 1990s
I need help all right.  They're coming after me. +++$+++ 1990s
Huh? +++$+++ 1980s
I see you're playing your radio, Major. Isn't that contrary to my instructions for the personnel of this base? +++$+++ 1960s
Show some compassion. +++$+++ 1990s
Who I am, outside of this boat. What the hell I'm doing here. +++$+++ 1990s
We're very upset with her.  Get someone to <u>double for her</u>, her tits, the tits scene, call L.A.  I want to see some <u>pictures</u> of the women's <u>tits</u>.  Of their <u>tits</u>. +++$+++ 2000s
Can't eat through a canvas bag. +++$+++ 1990s
Hey, I'm glad you put truth in your song, man. That's important. +++$+++ 1990s
Then what are you saying? +++$+++ 2000s
I'm tired of dealing with peons.  I need to get to whoever's in charge. +++$+++ 1990s
You must take me for an imbecile. Why do you think I asked you to meet me in Washington?  I haven't spent five minutes in New York City without the company of a gendarme. +++$+++ 1970s
I killed him.  When I was 15.  He was my first.  Nah, wishful thinking.  Liver cancer. +++$+++ 2000s
Do you take risks? +++$+++ 1990s
What did you do with her? +++$+++ 1940s
Yes. +++$+++ 1970s
I'm sorry. Sam had to do a new crown, we had [?], and Jason had a sore throat.  Your big graduation, and no one was there. +++$+++ 1980s
Mr. Jung, do you know Diego Delgado? +++$+++ 2000s
How about capturing the kitchen and barricading the door? +++$+++ 1950s
If you want to call it that. +++$+++ 1970s
We'll follow you.  Take it slow,okay? +++$+++ 1980s
No. +++$+++ 1990s
Why do they read kids fairy tales in the first place?  Children are very impressionable, you know. +++$+++ 1990s
Did that help? Did you learn anything? +++$+++ 2000s
Now she was put in the nuthouse in 1930 at the age of 16. +++$+++ 2000s
The milkmaid's daughter? +++$+++ 1970s
Of course. +++$+++ 1990s
Yeah, we're all above that. +++$+++ 1990s
Yeah, exactly.  Those're pre-programmed course adjustments you're looking at. +++$+++ 1990s
Let's make more popcorn. +++$+++ 1970s
I mean, how can you go through life without never having made a prank call? +++$+++ 1990s
No problem. +++$+++ 2000s
Where to? +++$+++ 1970s
Okay, one of us sneaks in, gets four ticket stubs off some kids in the audience, comes back out, and we all "re-enter" the concerto. Voila! +++$+++ 1990s
Hi honey.  What's going on?					* +++$+++ 1990s
There you go again. Stop saying that. You can make it. +++$+++ 1980s
Originally, Connecticut. +++$+++ 1990s
Colonel Reed... +++$+++ 2000s
How could it be irresponsible, Sir, if you were the first man in the world to do it? +++$+++ 2000s
She had a... a hole in the palm of her hand!  She could have bled to death. +++$+++ 1980s
I... I'll get the grits. +++$+++ 1990s
I can't fly. I haven't got any wings. +++$+++ 1940s
Me? +++$+++ 1930s
You spend enough time down a man's throat, you get to know his tonsils. Do it ... +++$+++ 2000s
Roper, we're into it... +++$+++ 1990s
So attack is your defence. Well let's hope Cetshwayo will offer his Impis full destruction. +++$+++ 1970s
Are you serious? +++$+++ 2000s
You're not ready yet. They said two days. +++$+++ 1980s
"Don't write any checks you can't cash." +++$+++ 1990s
Anything to spare? +++$+++ 1960s
Something went wrong. System malfunction. Explosion. Mrs. Peel had a narrow escape. Suspected sabotage. Nothing proven. File still open. +++$+++ 1990s
Is it? Because of my mistake six men didn't return from that raid. +++$+++ 1980s
Noooo.... +++$+++ 1990s
Well he wasn't one of the Marx brothers, but he made me laugh. +++$+++ 1990s
If I did, I wouldn't come within fifty yards of your door. +++$+++ 2000s
This is Richter sir...I've got them pinned down. +++$+++ 1990s
I can't talk now. +++$+++ 1970s
I have a sore throat. +++$+++ 1970s
If I eat it I'll throw up. +++$+++ 1990s
It does indeed, Max. +++$+++ 2000s
You're not from L.A., huh? +++$+++ 1990s
Now you're talking. +++$+++ 1990s
You never thought of the possibility? +++$+++ 1990s
No, no, no.  You gotta listen to the way people talk.  See, you don't say like "Affirmative" or some shit like that.  You say... no problemo. +++$+++ 1990s
I saw Teresa. Maybe I was the last to see her except perhaps her Mamacita and her little brother. I was going past -- +++$+++ 1940s
Just come on, I've got an idea. +++$+++ 2000s
Every wire transfer gets rocketed through a series of multiple switches. As soon as each deposit lands somewhere, it's shot somewhere else. It ends up so clean the Mafia couldn't find it. +++$+++ 1990s
You talk as if— +++$+++ 1930s
How you doing back there? +++$+++ 2000s
Mark 20 Into the black hole,  areao. +++$+++ 1990s
Not so fast!  All trips are canceled. We pay for wire services. And what we don't get from them, we'll invent. +++$+++ 1980s
Sherry, Sherry... +++$+++ 2000s
Well, I don't think he's really been embarrassed by it. +++$+++ 1980s
Yes. +++$+++ 1970s
When he finds out. +++$+++ 1990s
Father, I was in the Army for awhile and every time they told us we were on a mission to save the world the only thing that changed was I lost a lot of friends. So thanks for the offer.. but no thanks. +++$+++ 1990s
Daskylus… +++$+++ 1990s
Why don't you start by saying "yes," and then getting me one of those swell pineapple kabobs. +++$+++ 1990s
Uh-uh.  Wait... +++$+++ 1980s
You could've killed us. +++$+++ 2000s
How? +++$+++ 2000s
Look, Mr. Roundy, why don't you make out a financial statement? It'll save us both some time. Miss Michaels here can show you... have it notarized and we'll see where we go from there. Miss Michaels, would you get me a couple of forms? +++$+++ 1970s
Dr. Soong must have found it unnecessary in later versions. +++$+++ 2000s
Mn-hm. +++$+++ 1990s
It wasn't 'till we got on the ground floor that I totally realized they weren't gonna shoot unless we shot first. When we got out of the stairwell, I remember thinking, 'Oh my God. This might work.' But Mickey knew it would work all along. There wasn't any doubt in his mind. It's not like there was and he just didn't show it. He knew it would work. +++$+++ 1990s
If the Japanese are pansies, then pansies are my kind of people. Sheila steps over to the booth with their food. The Buzz Burger has three holes cut in the middle to make it look like a bowling ball. Buzz sees the two sleazeballs park their car and walk towards the diner. +++$+++ 1990s
Hello? +++$+++ 2000s
That's it, we're empty ma'am ! +++$+++ 1990s
You ever been in this town before, to your knowledge? +++$+++ 2000s
They? +++$+++ 2000s
Yeah.  I better get on with my work. +++$+++ 1990s
I know.  People's movies aren't their lives. +++$+++ 1990s
It will take a lot of courage and backbone on the part of the CNS to get this on the air.  In fact, I would understand fully if the subject matter is deemed too risque, too controversial. +++$+++ 2000s
I would advise you not to interfere. +++$+++ 1940s
At the end of every chapter -- +++$+++ 1940s
Which brings me to rule number three: which says, fuck rules one and two, skip bail and take off. +++$+++ 2000s
All right.  Get a hold of yourself. Take a deep breath, let it out slowly and tell me who you are. +++$+++ 1960s
You see, Wilhelm, I'm talking about ordinary, everyday reasons. Which is why I want to discuss your private life.  How many illegitimate children do you have? +++$+++ 2000s
You'd think they've never seen a new toy before. +++$+++ 1990s
That was my first instinct too. Or D.W.I. Anything but this. And I'm going to punch that Bleeker kid in the weiner the next time I see him. +++$+++ 2000s
It is to us!  It's computerised. +++$+++ 1990s
Are they polar bears, too? +++$+++ 1990s
I don't even know you. +++$+++ 1970s
Single shots doesn't mean a fire fight. That's not a battle going on. +++$+++ 1990s
The next time you're in wild country like this, keep in touch with the British Consul. +++$+++ 1930s
You see how much you like her? +++$+++ 1960s
Who says so? I'm going to the morgue -- to look -- +++$+++ 1940s
I don't know.  Smile.  Sneeze. Something.  You've got a bag full of money and a ride to Paris.  Fuck it, I don't know...  What kind of music do you like? +++$+++ 2000s
What do you want?  Do I know you from somewhere? +++$+++ 1970s
Nothing. +++$+++ 2000s
It's only 11:00 here boys so I got lot's more drinkin' ta do with your worthless relatives down at the Anvil. +++$+++ 1990s
Forty-five minutes. +++$+++ 1990s
I don't know. I guess kids were hitting each other or something. +++$+++ 1990s
I thought you were going to stay with us for awhile? +++$+++ 1980s
Nobody. Accounting. +++$+++ 2000s
Now wait a minute-- +++$+++ 1990s
Do I make you horny? +++$+++ 1990s
Are you glad?  I'm glad. +++$+++ 2000s
Stop acting like you're someone special. You're just like the rest of us. +++$+++ 2000s
I don't know. +++$+++ 2000s
Yeah.  He lived there.  And died there, too. +++$+++ 2000s
Blue. +++$+++ 1970s
I see. You realize, however, that you committed a crime? +++$+++ 1940s
Too late, Honey. Fooled you. Done called him. He'll be here.  Or I'll go get him. Come on Karl, I need you to help me ice down a tub of beer, you and Frank. +++$+++ 1990s
Good idea - with a boss who's a really ugly son-of-a-bitch. +++$+++ 1990s
Smoke. +++$+++ 2000s
Mom doesn't like me to have them. +++$+++ 1970s
Just call me Barney. +++$+++ 1930s
Waring Hudsucker! Na-ha-ha-ha-ha! Say, buddy! +++$+++ 1990s
Why is that? +++$+++ 1980s
How're the cameras doing? +++$+++ 2000s
The white horse.  The horse that is going to greet me when he sees me. +++$+++ 1940s
We've only seen and talked to one suspect. He calls himself "Joe". There's two jewelers, two salespeople, the manager, a security guard, and an elderly woman. This particular store is where they do a lot of jewelry making and repair. They have anywhere from 8 to 10 million in raw stones on any given day, so they sure as shit didn't just wander in. They knew what they were coming for. +++$+++ 1990s
My mother -- she lives in Detroit. Come on now -- give me those stamps. +++$+++ 1960s
Okay.  I went after him.  I lost my temper. +++$+++ 1990s
True. +++$+++ 1990s
No, see, I want both of us to get crazy. We should both be cutting loose. I mean, this is our last chance. This is our week! It should be something we share. +++$+++ 2000s
Here! +++$+++ 1940s
I'm sure it is, Frank: and let me tell you something. If we find it so complex, how in the hell you think you're going to make a jury understand it?  See my point? Let's talk a minute. Frank: what will you and your client take right now this very minute to walk out of here and let this damn thing drop? +++$+++ 1980s
Her Highness' Equerry. +++$+++ 1990s
I like all of them -- +++$+++ 1970s
That cleaning woman doesn't... +++$+++ 1990s
No! I swear I don't know! Please! +++$+++ 1990s
I don't know why I come here every evening, it's always such bad news. +++$+++ 2000s
Okay.  Where to begin?  With your constant absenteeism?  With your unpresentable appearance?  You're up for review... +++$+++ 1990s
You go wait in the car. Wait a minute. +++$+++ 1990s
That's it.  My client doesn't have to take this crap from you. +++$+++ 1990s
Hey -- you called me... I... +++$+++ 1990s
Aw. +++$+++ 2000s
Long as Charlie says. +++$+++ 1990s
Yep.  There's some great places nearby. +++$+++ 2000s
Well, look here! +++$+++ 2000s
I'm just taking the poor girl under my wing. +++$+++ 1990s
I am sorry for you Mr. James.  I'm grieved to keep you or any gentleman waiting.  Had you not better to arrange with my doctor or get the cook to flavor my omelette with arsenic?  What are the odds, gentlemen, that I don't live to see Mr. James hang yet? +++$+++ 1970s
A long time ago... +++$+++ 2000s
She says she's on the rag every time I get called in to investigate a murder. +++$+++ 1980s
My shift ends at four, but I couldn't -- +++$+++ 2000s
Okay, boys, let's have it. +++$+++ 1990s
You'd probably have to go somewhere to really look into it. +++$+++ 1990s
Can't you please finish your drink? +++$+++ 1960s
Yeah, you already told me that. You cut that slice down to bite-size and maybe we can talk. +++$+++ 1960s
Oh, you think so?  Well, I've got news for you.  You've got Dracula's brother-in-law in there and he's got my girlfriend and her kid.  Around about midnight tonight, when you're partying uptown, this guy's going to come to life and start doing amateur head transplants.  And that's just round one. +++$+++ 1980s
You promised us real things -- a real... +++$+++ 1930s
What went wrong? +++$+++ 1980s
The car broke down. +++$+++ 1970s
What are you looking at? +++$+++ 1990s
I felt like it, so what? Goddam, you and Ann make such a big deal out of it. +++$+++ 1980s
I've got a little challenge for you, Sark -- a new recruit. He's a tough case, but I want him treated in the usual manner. Train him for the games... let him hope for a while... and blow him away. +++$+++ 1980s
He left.  I couldn't believe it-- he just left!  It's as if he's somewhere else... I'm only getting a piece of him. +++$+++ 2000s
Yes. +++$+++ 1970s
Aw come on, it was the only thing to do.  He knew he was holdin' ya back. +++$+++ 1970s
She still talking to you? +++$+++ 1980s
What virus are we talking about, Dad? +++$+++ 1990s
Yes sir. +++$+++ 1990s
Yes, we appreciate that. +++$+++ 2000s
You were set up, Lonnegan.  Shaw's been planning to beat your game for months.  He was just waiting for you to cheat him so he could clip ya. +++$+++ 1970s
Thank you, Jonah.  But the point is, I am not asking permission. +++$+++ 1990s
You want us to get ourselves killed? +++$+++ 2000s
Casharoonie! +++$+++ 1960s
Yes. +++$+++ 1990s
I'd go Special Reconnaissance. Every bit as tough -- and we have a 60 percent drop-out rate among the men. +++$+++ 1990s
Now you're talkin'. +++$+++ 1990s
What's he do? +++$+++ 1990s
Where are we do you think? +++$+++ 1980s
Won't?  Or can't? +++$+++ 1980s
Yeah, so? +++$+++ 1980s
A sign on him? +++$+++ 1990s
What did he have to do -— look at the body? +++$+++ 1940s
About eight o'clock. +++$+++ 1950s
Run! +++$+++ 2000s
Oh, yes. +++$+++ 1980s
To Bembry? Is Bembry your friend? +++$+++ 1990s
I'm only asking you to look at this, Doctor. Either you will or you won't. +++$+++ 1990s
Hardly a worry, sir. +++$+++ 1990s
She made me promise not to. +++$+++ 1980s
Mrs. Straub! +++$+++ 2000s
Bad breath?  Long fingernails? +++$+++ 1980s
I got that beat.  So like, last May, I was supposed to stay at this cheesy bed and breakfast in Pennsylvania. There was a major gas leak no one knew about and all the guests suffocated during the night. +++$+++ 2000s
I talked to some developers about the land. +++$+++ 1990s
Objection! +++$+++ 1970s
I think it started in the wind. Money - arms, big oil, Pentagon people, contractors, bankers, politicians like L.B.J. were committed to a war in Southeast Asia.  As early as '61 they knew Kennedy was going to change things... He was not going to war in Southeast Asia.  Who knows? Probably some boardroom or lunchroom somewhere - Houston, New York - hell, maybe Bonn, Germany... who knows, it's international now. +++$+++ 1990s
We could do that. I could be on my way to Florida, and you could go to Thailand and fuck your brains out. +++$+++ 2000s
It doesn't matter. Your life is hard enough. +++$+++ 2000s
I trust you. +++$+++ 2000s
And Lydia telling Natalie the truth makes you a victim in what way? +++$+++ 1990s
Ouch!! +++$+++ 1980s
You think I could make it to the Show as a manager? +++$+++ 1980s
You can’t go! +++$+++ 2000s
You're clear.  You see the airlock? +++$+++ 1990s
All right then, if I have to go to school then I'd better go. +++$+++ 1980s
Who are the other characters? +++$+++ 2000s
OW! +++$+++ 1990s
Yes...I'm uh...I'm fine. +++$+++ 1950s
Who the... +++$+++ 1990s
What are these? +++$+++ 1990s
You told me you weren't seeing her at <u>all</u>. +++$+++ 1990s
You mean the snake. +++$+++ 1980s
I'm about to get off the elevator -- +++$+++ 1990s
Hand it over.  Basic plot? +++$+++ 1990s
Can we order first? +++$+++ 1990s
Never ceases to amaze me. Fuckin' jungle bunny goes out there, slits some old woman's throat for twenty- five cents. Fuckin' nigger gets Doris Day as a parole officer. But a good fella like you gets stuck with a ball-bustin' prick. +++$+++ 1990s
Got to, Sam. You and I are going to a courthouse together, put some people behind bars. +++$+++ 1980s
What's going on? What happened to Stacks? Is everything okay? +++$+++ 1990s
Do you know what happened to her? +++$+++ 1990s
Do you love me? +++$+++ 1990s
I— I never knew a girl like you, Edie. I always knew the kind you just grab 'em And— I never knew a girl like you, Edie. +++$+++ 1950s
Don't you want dinner first? +++$+++ 1970s
What about the world? +++$+++ 2000s
...and your name goes through like seventeen computers a day. 1984, yeah right man, that's a typo. Orwell's here and now, he's living large. We have no names, man, no names. We are nameless. Can I score a fry? Thanks. +++$+++ 1990s
Looks to me like your out of business. Now I want some answers. +++$+++ 1980s
Sir? +++$+++ 1990s
I know he wasn't much of a father. +++$+++ 1960s
Did I?  Only 'cause my mom trained me to, with a man... any man, all men --  Corn dog! +++$+++ 1990s
We did a piece after your story ran in the New York Times. +++$+++ 1990s
Yes, I guess you are. +++$+++ 1990s
So are you. +++$+++ 2000s
Shut your mouth 'bout my Lucille. +++$+++ 1960s
Why do you have to rush off? What's so important in San Francisco? +++$+++ 1960s
Josh said... +++$+++ 2000s
That's right.  Gray, the cabman. I've had a bit of dealing with MacFarlane in the past, you know. +++$+++ 1940s
It's your best play, Nicky. +++$+++ 2000s
I don't know anything! +++$+++ 1980s
No. But you will.  It's very important that you live. +++$+++ 1980s
Teresa?...Yeah, Charlie.  Listen, I'm looking for your cousin.  Yeah, well today's Tuesday, payday.  I haven't seen him all day...no...well, have you got any idea where he is?  I know it's early yet but I'm just getting worried that's all... +++$+++ 1980s
He was my father. +++$+++ 1990s
Most of them invite me to sit in the cockpit...play with the levers and things. MAVERICK Well, get used to it. +++$+++ 1980s
Hi Vada. +++$+++ 1990s
Waiter! She needs more water. +++$+++ 1980s
Brief marriage!  Ten years! +++$+++ 1940s
The room has a bug in it. +++$+++ 1970s
Okay.  Talk some more. +++$+++ 1980s
We could've had three weeks in Florida - all expenses paid.  Lying around in the sun - palm trees - frying fish... +++$+++ 1950s
Guess I must've learned. +++$+++ 2000s
Look, Doctor! +++$+++ 1970s
She let it escape because she wants me to die. +++$+++ 1990s
Do it! +++$+++ 1990s
It's so late. +++$+++ 1980s
All the good ones go for jerks, you know that.  Forget her.  Take out your trig book and figure out problem twelve. +++$+++ 1980s
What do you think? +++$+++ 1990s
For Peter, that's a short trip. +++$+++ 1980s
Oh I don't know, I think the tests work pretty well. Sometimes they give me answers you wouldn't admit to in a million years. +++$+++ 2000s
Why don't you watch? +++$+++ 1960s
Your equipment has crapped out again.... +++$+++ 1980s
Dwarves be very sensitive about their feet. +++$+++ 1980s
Listen, there's things I can take and a couple things I can't and one of them I can't take, is when my older brother --  -- who is everything I want to be, starts losing faith in things. I saw your eyes last night.  I don't want to ever see your eyes like that again, okay? I'm serious. +++$+++ 2000s
Leak at the plant.  They had to shut her down. +++$+++ 1990s
You what... +++$+++ 2000s
Checking out a theory. Just keep talking to him. +++$+++ 2000s
Oh, no, sir. I've never had a woman do that. I'm sure she drowned. +++$+++ 1970s
And that's all he had to do.  Just show his face. +++$+++ 1970s
I'm happy too and we want you to be happy. +++$+++ 1990s
I was downtown looking for a ... a friend.  A guy I know.  Anyway, there was this store.  Like real old?  Lotsa weird shit in there.  I saw this statue. Pillar.  Thing.  I knew he'd love it. You've seen the club. +++$+++ 1990s
Hi, how are you? +++$+++ 1990s
Come with me, Susan.  I want to show you something. +++$+++ 1990s
Oh my God! Oh shit! Phuket Thailand! +++$+++ 2000s
You put my friend in the ground, with your mickeymouse <u>TaskForce</u>...  Izsat the kind of Headlines that Preserve and Promote, you, sir? +++$+++ 2000s
Then relax.  It's a federal bank. Guaranteed by the government.  And Senor Noriega has very lenient banking principles.  No questions.  No problems. All the pesados keep their money here. Even El Padrino.  What do you worry? Everyone knows we are with Escobar.  Who is going to fuck with us? +++$+++ 2000s
For being a bastard with no manners and not a dook of an idea how to comport yourself publicwise, O my Brother. +++$+++ 1970s
Oh, hello, perhaps you could help me.  I'm looking for an aerosol love potion I could spray on a certain Penthouse Pet that would make her unconditionally submit to an unusual personal request. +++$+++ 1980s
Go ahead. +++$+++ 1990s
What's this? +++$+++ 1990s
For as long as I can remember. +++$+++ 1970s
You'll figure it out and you'll do good by him. +++$+++ 2000s
Well that's not going to happen tonight. George said Carlton's a nice guy. +++$+++ 1980s
I seen your fucking face. +++$+++ 1990s
The sled as a shield.... +++$+++ 2000s
That's right. +++$+++ 1960s
Dad, I'm trying.  The chairs, they won't scrunch. +++$+++ 1990s
Oh, yes, the lads frequently gather round the T.V. set to watch her for a giggle. Once we even all sat down and wrote these letters saying how gear she was and all that rubbish. +++$+++ 1960s
You're at the Institute full time? Or do you have a job? +++$+++ 1970s
Sybok possessed the keenest intellect I have ever known. +++$+++ 1980s
But still died. +++$+++ 2000s
Of what? +++$+++ 2000s
You don't need to do that. +++$+++ 1950s
Cause I don't just stick my dick in anything. +++$+++ 2000s
Robot huh? +++$+++ 2000s
... First time in my life I'll be a voice with a body.  Do you know what that means?  What this could lead to? +++$+++ 1990s
Me? No. No, I guess not. +++$+++ 1990s
I didn't wait long.  One day I was going to Mass, like I do every day, when the same strange wind started blowing again... +++$+++ 2000s
Shh! Is that so hard to believe? +++$+++ 2000s
Come on in. What you been up to? +++$+++ 1990s
On screen. +++$+++ 1980s
She never told anyone else.  About the convict strain -- or is it stain?  No, I was privileged.  I was someone who helped Jenny efface her past. +++$+++ 1990s
Kind of crept up on you, didn't it? +++$+++ 1990s
Mom, I want to go to the fair ... +++$+++ 1990s
I know I'm better than what I've been doing the last ten years, walking around in a tank top and fuck-me pumps, waiting till it's time to scream. +++$+++ 1990s
He was the only one I wasn't a hundred percent on. I should have my fucking head examined for goin' forward when I wasn't a hundred percent. But he seemed like a good kid, and I was impatient and greedy and all the things that fuck you up. +++$+++ 1990s
I was offered that job as a waitress. +++$+++ 1990s
His father worked in a strip mine north of here.  Toby's school class went up to the mine one day.  School takes field trips up there every year.  Big day for the kids when they can see ore tore up out of the ground.  Anyway, on this particular day Toby's dad up and falls into the machinery. +++$+++ 1970s
No. it's not Don. +++$+++ 1990s
Okay -- you know what you do?  You produce a film in a commercially proven genre.  And after it's a hit, you take the profits from <u>that</u>, and make the twelve Apostles' movies. +++$+++ 1990s
Then I demand an apology! +++$+++ 1930s
And that, my lord, is how we know the Earth to be banana-shaped. +++$+++ 1970s
That's one - way of looking at it.  You might also say this guy is brainless he has no brain'. +++$+++ 1990s
Would you mind walking ahead of me to the sun porch. I feel funny about coming into a dark house. +++$+++ 1960s
Ecology.  Folks use that term for everything but what it means: who's eating who. +++$+++ 1990s
Oh! +++$+++ 1930s
Who, Laddie? +++$+++ 1980s
Where are they? +++$+++ 1990s
Joseph, the British spent thousands of pounds and precious months putting together a fleet that Arnold stopped by sacrificing a heap of old barges.  In my opinion he saved my army. +++$+++ 2000s
No, man. It wrinkles my shit. Let's grab a fuckin beer -- +++$+++ 2000s
One or two.  A grey lot.  Some social democrats.  Some diligent anti-communists.  A political section man from the US Embassy. And this exquisite Californian wine, courtesy of the CIA. +++$+++ 1980s
Then we need to do a few things right away. No Pierre. He knows, the press knows. You're going to have to keep up your schedule -- your movements are followed too closely. And we need to get these guys out of the White House. George Ball's got a conference room at State.  Reconvene over there this afternoon, come back here tonight. +++$+++ 2000s
Oh, come, man, come. Just because you've sold your soul to the devil that needn't make you a teetotaler. +++$+++ 2000s
And what, Sergeant? +++$+++ 1980s
How are you, Kelly? Would you like to take a break for a minute? +++$+++ 1990s
I'll tell those mugs to keep their shirts on, that you'll be right down. +++$+++ 1930s
Let's move your ass in there!! +++$+++ 1990s
Susie, I like this new attitude of yours.  You're growing up and I like it!  I don't like it when you're limp and dependent, when you're odd and wayward.  This gives you a chance for real survival in a very lousy world.  Because, don't forget, dear, you won't always have me with you, will you...? +++$+++ 1950s
Perfect.  How am I gonna get away from the party long enough to -- +++$+++ 2000s
Yeah. She should be at Nasa tonight. Why you lookin for him? You like him now or sometin'? +++$+++ 1990s
I don't find this "turning the tables" thing very interesting -- +++$+++ 1980s
Well, is that really true? I mean, would you really get killed just to save his life. +++$+++ 1990s
And to say you're sorry.  About this afternoon.  And the things you said. Forgotten.  Completely.  Do you understand?  Forgotten. +++$+++ 1990s
You're welcome. +++$+++ 1990s
We get... what... twelve minutes of game, and it's over? Fuck! Fuck! Fuck! Fuck!!  I'm not even supposed to be here today! +++$+++ 1990s
"Let's see what she's got," said the Captain. And then we found out, didn't we? +++$+++ 1980s
Dave, I always play square.  No bugs. I'd love you to go on the record, but I"m in no hurry.  Whenever you're ready. +++$+++ 1990s
I was. What are you reading? +++$+++ 1980s
Hungry? After twelve years in the Burmese jungle.  I am starving, Lady Agatha -- starving for a white shoulder -- +++$+++ 1950s
I'm sorry? +++$+++ 1990s
Money. How they plan to make it by emptying the reservoirs, that I don't know. +++$+++ 1970s
Okay. Thanks. +++$+++ 1970s
Please, Palmer -- if you care for me at all, don't push this now -- +++$+++ 1990s
You haven't told me where we're going. +++$+++ 2000s
Sort of half..... +++$+++ 1990s
You know what we're going to do? We're going to shoot the works. A whole week in New York. A whole week in Bermuda. The highest hotels –– the oldest champagne –– the richest caviar –– the hottest music, and the prettiest wife! +++$+++ 1940s
Jaime, do you think, when this is all over, when we're in different divisions, you think maybe you and me, we could try again? +++$+++ 2000s
If he runs, everyone will assume he took the money. +++$+++ 1990s
Is that why your brother braved coming here to ask you for a loan? +++$+++ 1990s
Because I felt like it.  What do you care? +++$+++ 1990s
Even better. +++$+++ 1990s
Shocking, huh? We're clear now. It's done. I've never actually paid for a car. I want to see what it feels like +++$+++ 2000s
All over?  I kept trying to cover a very modest portion and still failed.  Are you leaving us?  Now's our opportunity to swap war wounds. +++$+++ 1990s
And Johnnie is his son, that's Johnnie Marzzone? +++$+++ 1990s
There's a rumor you've been going around miscalibrating the machines.  I don't think that's a good idea. +++$+++ 1990s
My mother. +++$+++ 1990s
Dorothy, let me tell you something, we are back. We are so very very back.  I re-signed Cush. We're set. +++$+++ 1990s
I don't want to have anyone live through that night again. +++$+++ 1980s
Who would know where they were hidden? +++$+++ 1980s
William Clay.  Call me Bill. +++$+++ 1980s
cross it...  The static overwhelms the voice, then cuts out. +++$+++ 1990s
I didn't make him for you +++$+++ 1970s
It's for my brudder.  Alvy Singer! Hey! This is Alvy- +++$+++ 1970s
What'd they call her in college? +++$+++ 2000s
Him, he costs you a fortune in breach of promise cases. He's a villain and a right mixer as well. +++$+++ 1960s
Baudmore Consultants. +++$+++ 1990s
We ought to start camping again, Dad. +++$+++ 1990s
Mr. Chekov, slow down. Take us forward, thrusters only, one quarter impulse power. +++$+++ 1990s
Yes. I can see: You've hung the rest of your relatives. +++$+++ 1990s
Good.  Total exhaustion can be spiritually fabulous.  Let's play catch. +++$+++ 1980s
INT. VITELLI'S HELICOPTER - DAY. +++$+++ 1990s
You mean,  me? +++$+++ 2000s
Not yet. +++$+++ 1980s
What is it you got between you? +++$+++ 1990s
Hey, Nick? +++$+++ 1970s
Mmm. +++$+++ 1980s
Yes. +++$+++ 1990s
There was Rose Cheramie.  A whore. Two Cubans threw her out of a car on the way to Dallas. +++$+++ 1990s
Well, would you like to know who it was you were marrying? +++$+++ 1940s
A man, miss -- an old man who lives in the garden at Fort Holland - with arrows stuck in him and a sorrowful, weeping look on his black face. +++$+++ 1940s
You gonna put it away? +++$+++ 1990s
I hope you won't talk that way to the police when they come here. +++$+++ 1930s
No, I mean... +++$+++ 1990s
Cut out that us business. +++$+++ 1950s
I had no idea... +++$+++ 1970s
Is that all that interests you? Gold? +++$+++ 1990s
I love Linda. Myself, I love Linda so much! +++$+++ 1970s
A few hitches sir, but I'm confident we'll have a prototype in no time. +++$+++ 1990s
Oh God, it's over now! +++$+++ 1980s
When do we bring'em back? +++$+++ 1990s
Oh yeah? And who's gonna come to save you, Junior?? +++$+++ 1980s
Yaay! +++$+++ 1980s
Where am I going to work? +++$+++ 1990s
Don't be ridiculous, these are my babies. +++$+++ 2000s
Yeah. hurry up though. +++$+++ 1990s
Blow me.  Yellow means go, Kimberly. +++$+++ 2000s
Isn't it true you have spent your life pretending to be something you're not, so much so that the art of concealment and dishonesty has become second nature to you?! +++$+++ 1990s
Someday, I'll find out. +++$+++ 2000s
See, I don't know how it happened... she's a smart girl and you are an extraordinary screwed-up guy... but she's in love with you. +++$+++ 1980s
You sure did. +++$+++ 1980s
You aren't? +++$+++ 1990s
Yes.  John made quite a study of the whole museum.  He had a copy of my original plans. +++$+++ 1990s
I want to know. We haven't talked this way in years. +++$+++ 2000s
Just gettin' rid of the garbage. +++$+++ 1990s
Shakespeare.  He's European. +++$+++ 2000s
No. But I can bypass it with one of these +++$+++ 1980s
Did you kill my father?! +++$+++ 1990s
If the stores are open - +++$+++ 1950s
I'll be back. +++$+++ 1980s
Is it all right if I go to the bathroom? +++$+++ 1970s
Ah Stephen, that's what this is really about, isn't it? You always have to be right. +++$+++ 1990s
I know that.  I'm warped... I'm warped! +++$+++ 1970s
Well, it ain't exactly a bed of roses down here. We gonna run or not? +++$+++ 1980s
Oh, but it is.  He's killing a person everyday and challenging us to catch him.  That's a game.  It has rules and objectives. +++$+++ 1990s
Yes.  I think you probably can.  We'd need to talk about your fee. +++$+++ 1990s
I don't care what people say. +++$+++ 1970s
Your decision. For us. +++$+++ 1930s
You don't really get it.  He's not a nightstalker.  It'll take more than bench presses to beat him. +++$+++ 1980s
Surely. +++$+++ 1980s
You want some advice? Don't do this again.  You know exactly what I mean. +++$+++ 1990s
That's right - came down in kinda spurts, didn't it?  You fellers'll have to figure it out.  You're scientists  All I know - they say it's as big as a house and practically red hot. +++$+++ 1950s
Crossin' the desert in a jalopy like this. +++$+++ 1940s
Hey, I'm eating. +++$+++ 1990s
Will you bring up my purse before you go? +++$+++ 1960s
I don't want you for my father! +++$+++ 1950s
You seen Mac? His bed hasn't been slept in. +++$+++ 2000s
Strip down a nun?  You want us to fry? +++$+++ 1990s
It's some psycho killer groupie. I got an anonymous letter that says she killed Bobby Vomit, Johnny Crunch, and now, this society dame. +++$+++ 1990s
Do you have the suspect in custody? +++$+++ 2000s
Take it easy, take it easy, it was an accident. +++$+++ 1970s
He's not really my uncle. +++$+++ 1990s
Oh, she's got a cold. She's in bed. Caught it coming home from school. They gave her a flower for a prize and she didn't want to crush it so she didn't button up her coat. +++$+++ 1940s
... If it happens, it happens. If it doesn't, it doesn't. Do you understand what I'm saying? You never know what's going to happen next, and the moment you think you know, that's the moment you don't know a goddamn thing. That's what we call a paradox. Are you following me? +++$+++ 1990s
Sometimes. +++$+++ 1990s
Nino, please... +++$+++ 1990s
Oh no.  Not by a long shot.  I may look like the old Daniel O'Brien, but on the inside, nothing is the same. +++$+++ 1990s
Good morning, Comrade Commissar. Here is my report on the materials available for trading in the next four months. +++$+++ 1930s
Go down there and kill everybody, I guess. +++$+++ 1990s
So, wait, you're from where? +++$+++ 2000s
Ow, shit... +++$+++ 2000s
Better watch out for that kind, Zackie. You know what they call 'em, don't ya? +++$+++ 1980s
Won't do, love.  It's not spring.  It's nearly autumn..You're in Oz.  everything's upside down and backwards here. +++$+++ 2000s
I am always glad to see you Paul. +++$+++ 2000s
We're no getting anywhere. All right, look, Tommy. The bogyman can only come out on Halloween night, right? +++$+++ 1970s
No...his business is bad.  But I'll decide what to do and you...and you just keep out of anything that might...might...er draw attention to you. +++$+++ 1980s
At Miracle Max's. It fit so nice, he said I could keep it. +++$+++ 1980s
I sure didn't expect her to drop dead. +++$+++ 1970s
I will do it. +++$+++ 1990s
He didn't even pull his pistol, huh? +++$+++ 1990s
I shot her. +++$+++ 1990s
I can hear her. Oh Mother of God, I can hear her. +++$+++ 1990s
Evan, I am so sorry, you were a saint to wait for us! +++$+++ 2000s
I don't know, Christine. Perhaps it's because I feel attacked. +++$+++ 2000s
That's because you' re not a total moron like they are. +++$+++ 1980s
Well, what's the point of waiting? +++$+++ 1990s
Must have been some time ago. Maybe forty years? +++$+++ 2000s
Oh yeah! Better be good and hurry away then! Who knows? We might be being watched! Maybe one of your stupid French companies has got a detective prying into your life - after all, that’s what they do to their employees, isn’t it? Huh! Hope you enjoy ruining people’s lives. Thanks for the lift! +++$+++ 1990s
But I have never seen this before. I am not complete. +++$+++ 1980s
Here I'll show you. +++$+++ 1970s
Yah, so we're all set. +++$+++ 1990s
I swear it will be done. +++$+++ 1980s
Now hold on, boys, hold on. Now, Kid, you kin see fifty yards, can't you? +++$+++ 1990s
The other side. +++$+++ 2000s
No. +++$+++ 1990s
But you think he fools around. +++$+++ 1990s
Okay, listen, just get the custom's office to send me a copy as fast as possible.  We can't send you new equipment until our file is complete.  Okay? +++$+++ 1980s
An Oldsmobile Silhouette. +++$+++ 1990s
You'll take care of it. Boy, you are smooth smooth, you know. +++$+++ 1990s
I have to tell you.  It's strange. +++$+++ 1990s
Lonesome? +++$+++ 1930s
Fifteen miles. I'll get your bags. +++$+++ 1960s
Flame on, flame off.  Flame on, flame off -- +++$+++ 1990s
I can't tell you that. +++$+++ 1980s
Two hours a day, six days a week. +++$+++ 1980s
Sometimes what a child says or fantasizes will give a clue to what ails him.  Did he say anything while he was still lucid? +++$+++ 1990s
--By itself it is only a piece of steel. Its power comes from he who wields it. For now there is no one. Do as I have ordered! +++$+++ 1980s
Johnny!  Uh, you, uh... should call first, you know?  Hey, where the hell were you all day?  You gotta at least call in or something.  You okay? +++$+++ 1990s
Hey. +++$+++ 1990s
Describe exactly what you think he did to Mrs. Leeds and I'll tell you if you're right or not. +++$+++ 1980s
Drew! +++$+++ 1990s
Maggie Muldovan? Did you...know her? +++$+++ 1990s
You poor, poor boy. +++$+++ 1950s
I bet.  What about me? Am I how you imagined? +++$+++ 2000s
My daughters -- yes, my daughters. +++$+++ 1930s
The Penny Saver sucks. +++$+++ 2000s
I was born, in New Orleans, too- +++$+++ 1990s
Well which of those three ya want fixed? +++$+++ 2000s
Steve -- +++$+++ 1940s
I think while we're waiting, we had better run some basic diagnostics on you. +++$+++ 1990s
Who's driving her? +++$+++ 2000s
I was playing naked. +++$+++ 1980s
Morpheus, what's happened to me? What is this place? +++$+++ 1990s
Take a bow, Steven, you've outdone yourself tonight -- scared holy hell out of even me. +++$+++ 1990s
I'll be right back. +++$+++ 2000s
Same with me, pretending I was you. An impulse.  Why not?  I had this shoe. +++$+++ 1990s
I think Tex did it. +++$+++ 1960s
Send in the next girl. +++$+++ 1930s
I once read somewhere that one quarter of all the people in the United States have at least one relative who has lived in Brooklyn at one time or another. +++$+++ 1990s
Oh my God. +++$+++ 1990s
It isn't enough that the monster killed all those people- that he killed Brady. Now he's got them to cancel the fair. +++$+++ 1980s
Because you lost my fucking carpet cleaning van and I don't like you. +++$+++ 2000s
Ah ha.  What did he want? +++$+++ 1990s
Oh, okay. +++$+++ 2000s
...They never caught that Black Dolya Killer, huh? +++$+++ 1990s
I don't know how. +++$+++ 1990s
What, "is"? +++$+++ 1970s
My wife used to call me Lenny. +++$+++ 2000s
What is this person's story here? +++$+++ 1980s
But it's a small room, Jason. +++$+++ 1940s
Well. I'm sorry, sir, but we've got to ask you for it. +++$+++ 1970s
You know Wilmont? +++$+++ 2000s
JAG gets here in three hours. Try for the confession. +++$+++ 2000s
You hear what I said? +++$+++ 1990s
Course, if Carl lost both batteries, dead in the water, his radio wouldn't work.  So how would he signal for help? +++$+++ 1990s
I do. I remember from day one. People staring at me, sensing I was different. Watching the fear grow in their eyes, knowing in their hearts I wasn't human. +++$+++ 1990s
Don't. +++$+++ 2000s
I told Zack about Saturday night, too. The fifth week's supposed to be the roughest. Come Wednesday, he'll be wishing he took my number. +++$+++ 1980s
Three nights, two days. When is your rent coming up at the motel? +++$+++ 1990s
That's not him... Jesus, stop freaking me out. +++$+++ 2000s
We could come to my room. +++$+++ 1930s
Right here someplace. +++$+++ 1990s
He's a doctor, Buster--doctors smell like ether. +++$+++ 1990s
I'm not crying. I'm allergic to fine home furnishings. See you later. +++$+++ 2000s
You're aware, are you not, that it costs a great deal to house your husband at Charenton... +++$+++ 2000s
Yes, your name? +++$+++ 2000s
That's what Winston does. He finds people who don't want to be found. +++$+++ 1990s
Tell me your name. +++$+++ 1980s
Hi, Baxter. +++$+++ 1960s
I don't want to...I have scary dreams. +++$+++ 1980s
You seem fine now. +++$+++ 1990s
What surery? +++$+++ 1990s
Oh, you know, the usual.  Bowl. Drive around.  The occasional acid flashback. +++$+++ 1990s
Let's go --  We got to get away from this phone. +++$+++ 2000s
Two. +++$+++ 2000s
I know it, I know it. +++$+++ 1970s
The Marquis de Sade and Origins of Sadism. +++$+++ 1970s
Creasy. Pinta likes him. +++$+++ 2000s
Give me a tremendous laugh here, Charlie. +++$+++ 1970s
I'll miss you so much. +++$+++ 1990s
Yes, sir. There are two in the Veridian system. +++$+++ 1990s
Where were you trained? +++$+++ 1940s
This is monstrous.  I'll burn in hell for all eternity. +++$+++ 1980s
What? +++$+++ 1930s
"I found a million dollar baby—" +++$+++ 1930s
So? What do they think -- we're not kids -- +++$+++ 1990s
About the plane? What do you think it’s gonna crash? Don’t say that... +++$+++ 2000s
We were probably in school together.  You went to Berkley? +++$+++ 2000s
He's gonna lose a finger eating eggs like that. +++$+++ 1960s
Did she always have nightmares? +++$+++ 1980s
Did he put you up to it? Did he ask you to sleep with me? +++$+++ 1980s
I used to come to this tree when I was a kid and imagine what my life would be like when I got older. +++$+++ 2000s
You never came back from the war. We were told you were missing and presumed dead. +++$+++ 2000s
You know, I never told anybody this, but I always had a feeling that when you die, before you go to heaven, you get a chance to fly around high school for a while. +++$+++ 1980s
Snow creatures ... they're here?! +++$+++ 1980s
'They won't.' +++$+++ 2000s
Right.  Auto-shop, you all set? +++$+++ 1990s
Yes, but, sir... if it could be accomplished, wouldn't that eliminate disease from the human frame and render man invulnerable to any but a violent death? +++$+++ 1970s
Janine, I'm sure a woman with your qualifications would have no trouble finding a top flight job in the housekeeping or food service industry. +++$+++ 1980s
Not just Kyle.  All of you.  His entire family.  Here.  Look at this. +++$+++ 1990s
You could have a pool to cool off in. +++$+++ 1980s
Right, seriously. +++$+++ 2000s
Nah, that's just Tony's way of telling me Judge Judy starts in ten minutes. You ever watch it? +++$+++ 2000s
There's a bathroom upstairs. +++$+++ 1990s
Oona tells me the raven has roosted for the night on a sharp stone spire some half a mile distance. +++$+++ 1980s
Maybe I oughta talk to this Ray Bones character myself. See if he wants to invest in my movie. +++$+++ 1990s
The mother said the boy hadn't slept for over three _months_. A physical examination showed dilated pupils, temperature of one-oh-two, blood chemistry highly imbalanced... +++$+++ 2000s
Umm. Well. Yes. But no more strange voices in the night, Rose. +++$+++ 1990s
Sir? +++$+++ 1970s
First light, we'll take a chopper out there and tell them to head back. +++$+++ 1990s
If we're on an island, why are they using trucks? +++$+++ 1990s
You're the Dread Pirate Roberts; admit it. +++$+++ 1980s
It's not regulation.  And the only way you're gonna stop anybody with it is to show it to him, and while he's laughing, you can shove it down his throat. +++$+++ 1980s
What do you mean by that? +++$+++ 2000s
No son, thisahere moonshine's got nothin' to do with shuttin' folks out. No, I'm usin' it to build somethin'. +++$+++ 1990s
In the helicopter. +++$+++ 1990s
Home. +++$+++ 1980s
That's right. +++$+++ 1990s
You can't be more specific than that? +++$+++ 1990s
HA! +++$+++ 2000s
It's a fucking nightmare, isn't it? +++$+++ 1990s
You're thinking of Mr. Wizard.  This guy's an eccentric genius. +++$+++ 1980s
Don't drop it Rose. +++$+++ 1990s
What? +++$+++ 2000s
Are you a married man, Mr. Deeds? +++$+++ 1930s
How'd you get the picture? +++$+++ 1990s
I can never keep them all straight - was she the super-bitch? +++$+++ 2000s
Should we knock? +++$+++ 2000s
Delmar? I never go out to California. That's a thousand miles from here. +++$+++ 1990s
You can't help them.  Right now they're being cocooned just like the others. +++$+++ 1980s
So...? +++$+++ 2000s
How old are you now, Toby? +++$+++ 2000s
So, Juno. First off, how far along are you? +++$+++ 2000s
Oh. Yeah. +++$+++ 2000s
ain't got a hat— +++$+++ 1930s
Come on, Ed. +++$+++ 1980s
A simple, unstoppable lifeform. What is a virus but a colonizing force that cannot be defeated? Living in a cave, underground, until it mutates. And attacks. +++$+++ 1990s
Bye. +++$+++ 1990s
Maybe I can do something right. +++$+++ 1980s
That's okay. That's his style. +++$+++ 1990s
Something I ate. +++$+++ 1980s
Still trying to figure it out myself. +++$+++ 2000s
Don't blame her, Rafe.  It's not like you're thinking. +++$+++ 2000s
Good point. +++$+++ 2000s
What's the matter, Matt? Gee, I thought you'd be thrilled to death. +++$+++ 1930s
What!?  What are you talking about?  Why should I help you? +++$+++ 1990s
We went out for about five minutes... which is four minutes longer than most of them.  But you can't hold it against him, he's... different. +++$+++ 1990s
You didn't like him? +++$+++ 1980s
And then... +++$+++ 1990s
How much? +++$+++ 1990s
Once you're in it, it warms up. +++$+++ 1990s
Potential? I don't understand. +++$+++ 2000s
To get my guns. +++$+++ 1980s
I'm not ready. +++$+++ 2000s
Lydia's trying, but they don't believe her. +++$+++ 1980s
Jack!  The courtyard's been taken... The Baron's forces are besieged in the south tower.  No sign of... Jack?  Do you hear what I'm saying? We've won, lad. +++$+++ 1980s
Offworld. The A.I.... this "Wintermute" thing evolved on a computer mainframe on the satellite Freeside. If you attack it from within the matrix while Molly accesses its original programming we can cripple its defence systems. +++$+++ 1980s
On the counter. +++$+++ 1990s
Holy mother, what is that? +++$+++ 1990s
...since I used to take you to the Proms? +++$+++ 1980s
I’m moving to Paris...it was right here...  It’s a box marked “Jack.”  I put it in the stack for the Salvation Army... +++$+++ 2000s
No? Then what? +++$+++ 1950s
No. +++$+++ 1970s
I'm sorry for losing it back there, but you must remember, sister, you have vows to God as well as a mission to the world. +++$+++ 1990s
Yes you are. +++$+++ 2000s
Mama? +++$+++ 1990s
Trust me. We're safe. +++$+++ 2000s
Oh boy, say, you think you're pretty good. +++$+++ 1970s
Morning... Say, you got any gas? +++$+++ 1970s
All you gotta do is place a bet for me at Shaw's place.  I'll supply all the money and the information. +++$+++ 1970s
Only in the emergency room or when he was well. +++$+++ 1990s
Sincere.  What are you talking about, of course I'm sincere with you, Mike. +++$+++ 1970s
It happened to you before? +++$+++ 1990s
There are plenty of other safe places. Why don't we go back to my flat? +++$+++ 1980s
But-- +++$+++ 1990s
You must believe me. +++$+++ 1980s
That's nothing compared to how my cousin Walter died. +++$+++ 1990s
One night. +++$+++ 1960s
How was your date? +++$+++ 1980s
He's right behind us! +++$+++ 2000s
I call it my shower dream. +++$+++ 2000s
Because it exists. +++$+++ 1990s
Listen, did anybody ever make a sucker out of you? This is a matter of principle. Something you probably wouldn't understand.  When somebody takes me for a buggy ride I don't like the idea of having to pay for the privilege. +++$+++ 1930s
Louise?... The maid?...  But she should have left earlier today... +++$+++ 1970s
Now Gallagher, if we could only get a great scene - a tremendously emotional scene - something that would just wring the hearts out of the public - to bring the curtain down in the second act - that would be okay. Couldn't dig one out of your hat some place, could you? +++$+++ 1930s
Now see here young man. +++$+++ 1980s
We don't have that kinda time, boss, I don't think Prague's gonna be around much longer. I've gotta go now. I've got a lot of bad guys to kill. +++$+++ 2000s
Me? Look at you! What're you doing in Hollywood? +++$+++ 1980s
YOU LOST YOUR BABY WHEN YOU LOST YOUR BALLS YOU'VE LOST YOUR MIND, YOU'VE LOST YOUR GRIP SO SAY BYE-BYE +++$+++ 1980s
My name is... +++$+++ 1990s
How do I know? +++$+++ 1990s
Their life expectancy is a hundred and thirty. +++$+++ 2000s
This is the ultimate. It's like the Taj Mahal of bad, fake 50's diners. +++$+++ 2000s
You expect me to believe that? +++$+++ 1980s
I don't think I belong here. +++$+++ 1970s
Sure, just watch where you're going. +++$+++ 1980s
They ought to be under the barbed wire soon. +++$+++ 1950s
Oh, Peter. A zit. +++$+++ 2000s
Mason, you have to take this... +++$+++ 1990s
Make someone happy-have you ever wanted to? +++$+++ 2000s
Don't worry about me.  Where are we going? +++$+++ 1990s
Is Noel in? +++$+++ 2000s
My mother said he never asked about-- +++$+++ 1990s
Hello. +++$+++ 1990s
If you want to. +++$+++ 1980s
It's in front of us. +++$+++ 1980s
Good evening Mr. Crabbin. +++$+++ 1940s
So why are they after you? +++$+++ 1990s
Have him meet me with pictures of Lecktor's books... +++$+++ 1980s
Lemme see if I got this right, you break into Karen Flores' house, ask me for three hundred grand, doesn't even belong to you? +++$+++ 1990s
No, you...didn't? +++$+++ 2000s
You know how you feel when you come out of a bad hangover? Like your eyes can open a little bit more. +++$+++ 2000s
But you looked as if you liked it. +++$+++ 1990s
Of course not. He wouldn't be. +++$+++ 1940s
Your dad has two computer disks.  They have funny names:  Marlon and Al. +++$+++ 2000s
No!... Yes, a little. You see Hollis and my fa... my father had a falling out... +++$+++ 1970s
I won't. You would misuse such power. I have paid enough for you, and I will have you. +++$+++ 1980s
Lotta rich women back there... +++$+++ 1960s
No, not yet. +++$+++ 1940s
Yeah.  You know Harry. +++$+++ 1990s
See my nipples? +++$+++ 1980s
That son of a bitch, everything he says is a phony piece of shit, what does he think, I'm some cigar butt he's got between his teeth -- +++$+++ 1970s
All right, Captain Oveur.  Over. +++$+++ 1980s
Debbie, men are pigs -- if they can have women, we can have men. +++$+++ 1980s
<u>Now</u>. +++$+++ 1990s
I'm not going to jump on you! +++$+++ 1960s
That's motherhood.  That's the job, with or without a career. I'm telling you the biggest gift you can give them is your happiness. They <u>need</u> you to be happy. +++$+++ 1990s
You know less than nothing.  If you even knew that you knew nothing, at least that would be something, but you don't. +++$+++ 1990s
Dear God. +++$+++ 1980s
How often does one of our clerks have business in the house of records? +++$+++ 1990s
But, hell, this is nothing compared to Venezuela.  When I was Vice President, Ike sent me down there like a blocking back.  They threw rocks, broke out our windows, almost overturned the car. Read Six Crises, Bob.  Boy, Pat was brave! +++$+++ 1990s
Shove the gentleman jockey in the make-up room or something and keep your eye on him, will you? +++$+++ 1960s
And tonight? +++$+++ 2000s
Not really - +++$+++ 2000s
I figure we'll get along just fine. +++$+++ 1940s
Defined by Webster's as harmless. +++$+++ 1990s
How long ago? +++$+++ 1940s
Okay.  Okay. +++$+++ 2000s
No matter what happens...I'm glad I met you. +++$+++ 2000s
You've seen her!...She's alive? +++$+++ 1950s
Exactly why it should be given away. +++$+++ 1990s
...  thank you. +++$+++ 1990s
And? +++$+++ 1990s
That's perfectly all right. +++$+++ 1980s
I like it. +++$+++ 2000s
But don't you see...the brain of Hans Delbruck is inside this grotesque hulk -- pleading with us.  I've got to untie it. +++$+++ 1970s
It appears that someone has taken over the Environmental Control Room. +++$+++ 1990s
Here's the data on the Clyde deal. +++$+++ 1930s
Hollywood. +++$+++ 1950s
Slower! Nobody can row at that speed! +++$+++ 1980s
Not much more.  Big day in the big city.  What's on your mind? +++$+++ 1990s
Yes I can... Oh look, let me do that for you, shall I? +++$+++ 1970s
Me neither...But this buck claimed he was a big war chief with the Nawyecky Comanches. +++$+++ 1950s
There's no way to practice this. And no time. Besides, I've planned it all. There aren't any surprises. +++$+++ 1990s
It's a family heirloom. +++$+++ 2000s
You've got to decide that for yourself. +++$+++ 1990s
That's right. +++$+++ 2000s
Been drinkin' today? +++$+++ 1990s
Yes, William, Uh, we have this <u>thing</u> we're doing... +++$+++ 1990s
In fifteen minutes I can teach you everything you need to know to dine with the Queen.  First, as you pick up the knife you shift your fork to the left hand. +++$+++ 1990s
I had a lot to do with that little press conference last night-- +++$+++ 1930s
You sure? I can always get you a lime. +++$+++ 2000s
That's two more than the Fantastic Four. +++$+++ 1990s
Murray. +++$+++ 1970s
Mr. Deeds, are you the son of Dr. Joseph and Mary Deeds? +++$+++ 1930s
Mrs. Haydn... +++$+++ 1980s
Yes, I did. +++$+++ 1990s
I finished the boats. +++$+++ 2000s
I got some more business for ya. +++$+++ 1990s
So do half the other people in this place. How do I know which one? +++$+++ 2000s
Anytime. +++$+++ 1990s
She left. +++$+++ 1990s
"I would bet on it." +++$+++ 1990s
You won't look pushy. +++$+++ 1980s
I think we have to work on narrowing down our list of suspects. Now I'm going to go check in with some of my contacts uptown. +++$+++ 2000s
No, I... I never killed anyone! +++$+++ 2000s
What... +++$+++ 1990s
Story of my life.  Well, one thing you won't lose is that friend of yours back there, I'll tell you that. +++$+++ 1990s
No. +++$+++ 1990s
Jesus Christ, Stanley, you can't go to the bathroom now.  You have exactly one minute before we're back on the air, this is NOT the time to go to the bathroom. +++$+++ 1990s
Is mom ever coming back? +++$+++ 1970s
Meyer, ain't anybody ever told you ya look more like a bookkeeper than a fuckin' mobster? +++$+++ 1990s
No!  Don't kill him! +++$+++ 1990s
So what do you want? +++$+++ 2000s
Mr. Dumbarton is, yes. +++$+++ 2000s
I see.  Well, I guess we don't have much to say to each other. +++$+++ 1960s
If you think I am behind this, say it. +++$+++ 1990s
Goodnight Shelly. +++$+++ 1990s
Who else phoned? +++$+++ 1950s
Somethin' knocked us off-lane. Maybe a rogue comet. Maybe we'll never know. +++$+++ 2000s
I know you believe that. +++$+++ 1980s
Easy, tiger.  What's in there? +++$+++ 1990s
I made a couple of lunches for you and put them in brown paper bags ...  I'm gonna go now. +++$+++ 1990s
You are late. I've been waiting for you -- waiting. +++$+++ 1930s
I felt you...looking through me... +++$+++ 2000s
Do you work? +++$+++ 2000s
They burn many villages. Even walled cities fall to them. +++$+++ 1980s
We tried to be.  We tried to be. +++$+++ 1970s
No. But he hands them over. +++$+++ 1990s
No, I tell you! Nobody knows where he got it. +++$+++ 1940s
Sleep 'N Eat, I was my wife's husband and grandchild at one and the same time.  And lo' and behold, as the husband of a person's grandmother is his grandfather, I Mantan, became my own grandfather. +++$+++ 2000s
You always get what you want? +++$+++ 1980s
Too far inland. +++$+++ 1970s
C'mon! +++$+++ 1990s
Joe Saracini. He was a mason that did some repairs on the brickwork at the rear of the house. That was in 1952. +++$+++ 1970s
Ok.  So, lemme just ask you a couple questions to start -- +++$+++ 1990s
Mom and Dad said it's yours. They seem to think you're coming home. +++$+++ 2000s
He was talkin' about arrangements ... we were talkin' about the TV. +++$+++ 1970s
Walter can I ask you something? +++$+++ 1950s
But it can't wait. +++$+++ 1980s
Sucks for you. +++$+++ 2000s
No.... +++$+++ 1980s
I'm sorry, too.  Wow.  That only took us between years to say. +++$+++ 1990s
Lemme see that. +++$+++ 1980s
Well it's pretty obvious you don't want me around any more. +++$+++ 1960s
Captain Dwyer.  Technically. +++$+++ 1990s
I thought you were a man of God. +++$+++ 1980s
That's what you think, is it, Jim? +++$+++ 1940s
That's true Doug, writers are supposed to write. +++$+++ 2000s
What happened? +++$+++ 1950s
If they do see thee, they will murder thee. +++$+++ 1960s
How many was that? +++$+++ 1990s
That's your problems The more women think, the more trouble they get into. +++$+++ 1980s
Look...  Do you wanna fuck me? +++$+++ 1970s
Didn't you have something to do with this?  I know you sent word to the Sixth Army Command! +++$+++ 1950s
What if I say I'll go out with you, so you can have all these great daydreams, but then never actually talk to you again? +++$+++ 2000s
You're supposed to make time. When was the last time you told her you love her?  When was the last time you two had sex? +++$+++ 1990s
You're too modest. +++$+++ 1970s
Why not just shoot Kennedy coming up Houston?  There's plenty of time - he's out in the open - a frontal shot? +++$+++ 1990s
I'm calling the cops. This is for the cops. +++$+++ 1980s
What? Oh, it's very impressive. +++$+++ 1990s
Ah, a philosopher. +++$+++ 2000s
Little Bill, I thought you were dead. I see you shaved off your chin whiskers. +++$+++ 1990s
Erin knows, doesn't she? +++$+++ 2000s
It would never have worked, Luthor. You are a dreamer  --  a sick, twisted dreamer. +++$+++ 1970s
Ow! +++$+++ 1990s
No, it's true.  Last night when you were sleeping, I had you all to myself. +++$+++ 1960s
What are you talking about? +++$+++ 1980s
Yes ... +++$+++ 1990s
But Ian, he's still but a boy. +++$+++ 1980s
Shouldn't we get a catheter in him? +++$+++ 2000s
I've been on another case. All day.  I suppose I can move it over. Seven fifty a week, plus travel expenses. +++$+++ 1970s
They had to, in order to survive. +++$+++ 1980s
Mine's Edward. And truthfully, I do want you to leave, Karl. But I want to leave with you.  You think this town is too small for you, well, it's too small for a man of my ambition. I can't see staying here a day longer. +++$+++ 2000s
Um...I'm pretty sure I'm Bruce Wayne. And you are? +++$+++ 1990s
What's with you? +++$+++ 1990s
Rac. R-A-C. Renovate, Automate, Computerize. That, my boy, is the future. One of the monitors shows a little girl bowling. Her ball moves so slowly it barely tips over the first pin. Kastle hits a key and the pins explode in an emphatic strike. The little girl jumps with joy. +++$+++ 1990s
At one time I could have chosen not to be. +++$+++ 2000s
No, I guess not. +++$+++ 1990s
Stop right there. +++$+++ 2000s
Well, fi' cents a box ain't much, but a fella can eat. +++$+++ 1940s
I heard about today.  Good job.  I'm all for capital punishment.  Why don't you go home and see your family? +++$+++ 1990s
Yeah, Billy, who's your buyer?... No, not interested.  Ollie, start calling a the institutions, start with Marx at Janson Mutual, then Reardon. Get me that California retirement money, baby! And we're on our way! +++$+++ 1980s
If that's the way you want to play it. +++$+++ 1990s
Want one? +++$+++ 2000s
Ya puttin' me on? +++$+++ 1970s
This is stupid.  It'd be just too easy. +++$+++ 1970s
Farewell, Concorde! +++$+++ 1970s
What? +++$+++ 1990s
You what? +++$+++ 1950s
Well, I'm home now, so you can go right to sleep.  C'mon, angel. +++$+++ 1980s
Good title. +++$+++ 1990s
Maybe you should drive him into Devil's Cauldron, let them decide what to do with him. +++$+++ 1990s
This here's a lawful contract... betwixt me an' Delilah Fitzgerald, the cut-whore. Now I brung her clear from Boston, paid her expenses an' all, an' I got a contract which represents an investment of capital. +++$+++ 1990s
All right, furry muff. +++$+++ 1990s
I should release Corbett because you want some votes? +++$+++ 1990s
No.  At the end... when we had him cornered, he got into my head. He showed me what we really look like, when the veneer's gone.  Jelly. Shit... +++$+++ 1990s
I see. +++$+++ 1980s
I can do that, too. +++$+++ 1980s
He's really cute! +++$+++ 1990s
In the last six weeks you've only been in my elevator once -- and then you didn't take your hat off. +++$+++ 1960s
Nice, baby. +++$+++ 1990s
... what? +++$+++ 2000s
You have faith, Professor Barnhardt +++$+++ 2000s
What I <u>should</u> have done a long time ago.  Applications and patents, Reed. This all belongs to me. +++$+++ 1990s
I never heard that. +++$+++ 1980s
Eighth room down, babe... +++$+++ 1990s
I knew it. 'Cause we wouldn't have heard anything if it was him. He's real careful. Fact is, he's anal. +++$+++ 1980s
Don't touch my mother... +++$+++ 1980s
Sol' things, chopped cotton--even Grampa. Got us about two hunnerd dollars all tol'. Shucked out seventy- five for this truck, but we still got nearly a hunnerd and fifty to set out on. I figger we oughta be able to make it on that. +++$+++ 1940s
Lauren, right? +++$+++ 1990s
Jesus. +++$+++ 1990s
The serial killer? +++$+++ 1990s
Give him some good exercise?  Sure Some stud.  Some string in fact. What're you gonna do, race 'em? +++$+++ 1990s
No. Not everything. +++$+++ 1990s
April 16...?  That means she was the first. +++$+++ 2000s
You got Pug killed! You tried to get ME killed! You just lost your Get- Outta-Jail-Free -- +++$+++ 2000s
So why don't you take a deep breath, Jake, and I'll count to ten. One. Two. Three... +++$+++ 2000s
I'm sorry.  It's just you're a really nice guy, and we don't want to see you get hurt. +++$+++ 1980s
See, we're very busy. A TV network that wishes to remain nameless has expressed an interest in our show. +++$+++ 1990s
But listen, Glenn.  If you're lying to me... +++$+++ 1990s
Just leave'em. There's plenty of other girls. +++$+++ 1970s
I had no idea you were even here. +++$+++ 1950s
Well, a course they're gonna say that! But where's my protection? They got Jean here! I give these sons a bitches a million dollars, where's my guarantee they're gonna let her go. +++$+++ 1990s
I can't believe I'm hearing this, +++$+++ 2000s
Max. +++$+++ 1990s
They are old, we are young, they are fast, we are fun. +++$+++ 1990s
Even if I'm near a fire, I'm cold. I guess just about everybody's cold. +++$+++ 1950s
Still in a bad mood?  At least you're speaking.  What's your name? +++$+++ 2000s
I don't care what you say about him. The boy has got it bad. +++$+++ 1990s
Be careful. +++$+++ 1990s
What do you want? +++$+++ 1990s
I fell in love. After that, I never thought about being anything but a rancher's wife. I never saw it like I was losing some other life, just felt like I was gaining one. I know that's not a popular opinion nowadays and I ain't saying it's the right one. We all have to find the life meant for us. +++$+++ 1990s
One thing that's hard to understand is how you could have this incredible background in music, and then just walk away from it, without a second thought... +++$+++ 1970s
Sanford's brother dates her cousin. He found out this morning. +++$+++ 1990s
Unless it's illegal in the UK to serve liquids below room temperature: I don't want you going to jail just to satisfy my whims... +++$+++ 1990s
It's locked? +++$+++ 1990s
Then I know my alphabet. +++$+++ 1940s
I like that. +++$+++ 2000s
Science thinks there isn't. That we are all alone in the universe. +++$+++ 1970s
Well, then, I'm afraid I'm gonna have to keep it. +++$+++ 1990s
Didn't you feel the house rock? You must have seen all those shell bursts. +++$+++ 1980s
What, come on? +++$+++ 1990s
You, me and White, huh? +++$+++ 1990s
I have no idea. +++$+++ 1980s
All right-so we can afford it. +++$+++ 1970s
And is that it? +++$+++ 1990s
Report. +++$+++ 1990s
Objection.  The question calls for a conclusion on the part of the witness. +++$+++ 1990s
I still don't know what that means. +++$+++ 2000s
Yah? +++$+++ 1990s
Caspiar?  I haven't heard of that. +++$+++ 1990s
Well I like your style too, man. Got a whole cowboy thing goin'. +++$+++ 1990s
No, I... I think we should talk about this. +++$+++ 1990s
And you said yes? +++$+++ 1990s
King—King Westley was in it. +++$+++ 1930s
Okay boys, smile! +++$+++ 1990s
You'd be surprised. Most guys have kids or wives or girlfriends. They're busy. It's not as easy as you think. +++$+++ 1990s
If you say so. +++$+++ 1980s
Not usually this drunk. +++$+++ 1990s
But how'll I put on the slipper, sir? +++$+++ 1930s
Good. +++$+++ 1970s
Because we're running a newspaper, Mr. Kane, not a scandal sheet. +++$+++ 1940s
I didn't mean it. +++$+++ 2000s
Benjamin -- do they know you? +++$+++ 1960s
I can't hardly understand you when you talk with one of them Mores in your mouth. +++$+++ 1990s
She wants to see what you can do. +++$+++ 1990s
Where? +++$+++ 1990s
I got a bad feeling about this.... How much do you need? +++$+++ 2000s
Are you a believer, then? +++$+++ 1990s
They're dying. +++$+++ 1990s
It's his show for now.  Look, you want to get some dinner?  Inter- Agency cooperation and all? +++$+++ 1990s
Running away?  From what? +++$+++ 1950s
Okay. +++$+++ 1950s
Miles, how nice of you to see us -- may I introduce Howard D. Doyle of Doyle Oil. +++$+++ 2000s
Yeah, you had a piece of pussy on a plate in front of you, you'd probably kill it. +++$+++ 1980s
But it's possible. +++$+++ 1970s
Wallace has sacked York! +++$+++ 1990s
There is -- I've seen things through that window! Bickering, family fights, mysterious trips at night, knives, saws, rope -- and since last evening, not a sight or sound of his wife! Now you tell me where she is and what she's doing! +++$+++ 1950s
Thank you, sir. +++$+++ 2000s
Two words. +++$+++ 1990s
You cruise A.I.'s, you end up on tape. +++$+++ 1980s
We're all going. +++$+++ 1970s
Aw, you're tough. +++$+++ 1990s
This isn't fucking funny, Dante! +++$+++ 1990s
Run it then. +++$+++ 1980s
You gotta be kidding. +++$+++ 1970s
Remember that demon in the gut? Sometimes it's nothing more than wondering if the so-called civilized life has bred the balls and brains out of you.  That's what you want out of this, isn't it? +++$+++ 1990s
It's not that, it's just that...  It I get caught, I'll lose my science scholarship and everything. +++$+++ 1980s
I think we should see your uncle. +++$+++ 1980s
It should, or it will?  Least going back the way we came we know what we're up against. +++$+++ 1990s
In that case you can do it. You were quite happy to do a lot more last night. +++$+++ 1990s
No. This guy is big time.  These two are street-walking scum. +++$+++ 1990s
There's all kinds of horses, Ain't there?  Same with Cowboys. What they do's their affair.  I Don't preach and I don't judge.  I Ain't no dog-catcher. +++$+++ 1990s
We wanted you and Jimmy to have it someday. Something real and honest. +++$+++ 2000s
I haven't seen much of you. +++$+++ 1980s
I'll slip in, talk them into to come out, and you'll be free to blow holy high heaven the whole lot of them. +++$+++ 2000s
Faith. +++$+++ 1980s
It had better be good. +++$+++ 1930s
Let's face it, what the fuck are you doing in Las Vegas? +++$+++ 1990s
Mr. Smith -  -- the "complimentary couch." +++$+++ 1980s
He says on the photo he'll call tomorrow at eleven.  Why not come back then and listen for yourself. +++$+++ 1990s
Ana paira ninas. Koko's the brains. +++$+++ 1960s
Engine room reports auxiliary power restored. We can proceed at impulse power. +++$+++ 1980s
No sick people in the country, huh?... Just tell me one thing, Rhian. Leon’s story about the boy? You just took his word for it? +++$+++ 1990s
Stick with me, kid.  Looks big when you get here but you can cover it in five minutes. +++$+++ 1990s
How much? +++$+++ 1970s
Hey, I got a staff to pay, plus rent, plus I haven't billed a minute of my time since I started on this case, so you can quit hitting me up like I'm rich or something. +++$+++ 2000s
Which ranch? +++$+++ 1940s
Most authentic Mexican food in Springwood, which isn't saying much.  your parents still live around here? +++$+++ 1980s
Don't you want me to? +++$+++ 1990s
Accidents. Fatal. Each of your prior wives, so we've been informed. +++$+++ 1990s
How will they come at you? +++$+++ 1970s
Cosmo, this is Ronny, Johnny's brother. +++$+++ 1980s
You don't get the Mask code unless I go. +++$+++ 1990s
I can get it -- I can almost reach it, Dad. +++$+++ 1980s
Get me Air Support...  We'll be airborne and assault the ambush... +++$+++ 2000s
I'm so happy I could shit. +++$+++ 1990s
Why'd you stay behind?! +++$+++ 1990s
And you honestly expect me to believe all this? +++$+++ 1990s
Waynette! +++$+++ 1970s
That would be great.  It better help.  What can you do with yourself if all you do is look good? +++$+++ 1980s
Step inside. +++$+++ 1990s
Wire pull over? +++$+++ 1970s
Susan, I want you to stop this. And right now! +++$+++ 1940s
Are you just making that up to make me feel better? +++$+++ 1960s
...necklace... pearls... +++$+++ 1990s
This is my favorite part.  Even more treacherous and dangerous than he is charming and fascinating. He has never taken a single step or spoken a single word without some dishonorable or criminal intention. Every young girl he has successfully pursued has regretted it. +++$+++ 1990s
That's what I always say. +++$+++ 1980s
I'll sue. +++$+++ 1980s
Thanks, Doc. Maybe I'll come back with a date. Or an elephant. +++$+++ 1980s
Where is she? +++$+++ 1990s
You don't think I'm smart enough to be serious about. +++$+++ 1970s
A night in the hole? +++$+++ 2000s
Blow-dart hunting stick from Papua New Guinea. Very <u>very</u> rare, since the tribe's extinct. +++$+++ 2000s
I'm telling you he's not your husband at all. +++$+++ 1980s
A hundred and five years?  He really hung on, didn't he. +++$+++ 1980s
I know a great place.  ...UH...WARREN! +++$+++ 1990s
I can subpoena you, you know. I can get you up there on the stand. +++$+++ 1980s
I'm serious, man. Don't mention it. Ever. +++$+++ 2000s
Maria? +++$+++ 1930s
Lions and tigers and bears! +++$+++ 1930s
She great or what? +++$+++ 2000s
What a great surprise.  I didn't think we had a chance.  I heard you wanted to stay in Washington. +++$+++ 1980s
Congratulations, you've just graduated at the head of your class. +++$+++ 2000s
Any friends? +++$+++ 1990s
That gorilla in Man's clothing-- McGann. +++$+++ 1930s
You're on your way somewhere all right...the looney bin. +++$+++ 1980s
They got that kind of money? +++$+++ 2000s
Did you send this? Is it a joke? +++$+++ 2000s
Where's the old half--Mexican? +++$+++ 2000s
Pardon me? +++$+++ 1980s
Let's go. +++$+++ 1990s
You were the Yoni Yum girl from, let's see,  from nineteen sixty-eight through nineteen seventy. You've always smelled so nice. Like a little sister. The irony has just killed me. You, the Dew Girl, one of the few girls who doesn't need Dew. I loath the stink of females! They are so sweet the way God made them, then they start fooling around with men and soon they're stinking. Like rotten mushrooms, like an excessively chlorinated swimming pool, like a tuna fish's retirement party. They all stink. From the Queen of England to Bonanza Jellybean, they stink. +++$+++ 1990s
Take a top coat. +++$+++ 1950s
Walls of shining crystals, burning with red fire, furnishings of metals and jewels never seen by man... +++$+++ 1980s
You're a ringer.  She brought you in to replace me.  Out with the old. +++$+++ 1990s
What should I say? You did fine work. We'll wait on the lab. +++$+++ 1990s
No, they're living in Nice now. +++$+++ 1990s
What? +++$+++ 2000s
What do you mean? +++$+++ 1980s
I'd better get back.  Say goodbye here. +++$+++ 1990s
It's early for him. +++$+++ 1990s
Yes.  It's called accountability. +++$+++ 2000s
How about it? +++$+++ 1960s
Aiding an escaped criminal! And a little charge of kidnapping I'm looking into.  But that's the jail! There must be somebody there! +++$+++ 1940s
No. But I fear it's intention may have been to kill the peace accords and spark a civil war between the Hutu Militia and the Tutsi rebels. +++$+++ 2000s
Okay? +++$+++ 1970s
What? +++$+++ 1950s
White House boys want a private meeting. +++$+++ 1990s
Well, no. You agreed to stay on the air as long as we asked you to. The station entered into this on that understanding. If you had refused we'd have begun this with somebody else. You can't just change the rules in the middle of the game, son. It's not fair to us. More importantly, it's not fair to the viewers. They're interested in you. They've devoted hours and days and weeks of their lives to you. +++$+++ 1990s
Sorry... +++$+++ 1990s
Do you ever regret not having a family? +++$+++ 1990s
Marge-maintenance. +++$+++ 1990s
So I've heard-- +++$+++ 1990s
That aside for the moment, I'm struck by the tenor, the ill-spirit of your report... the degrading remarks by other aviators... innuendo about her performance in unrelated situations... even a reference to her sexual activity the weekend prior.  In my seven years on this committee, I've never seen a downed aviator treated like this.  Never.  I'm deeply disturbed by this report, Mr. Hayes.  Not just what it bodes for women in the military -- but for your own confirmation as well. +++$+++ 1990s
I don't think so. One come out here once an' I clipped him from behin' with a fence stake. They ain't bothered since. +++$+++ 1940s
I don't think this is the lightning you are looking for.  Drew's a good man.  I know I didn't seem to be completely in his corner before, but I've come to appreciate -- +++$+++ 1990s
Well, thanks a lot. +++$+++ 1980s
Barker's wife called me at three this morning; her husband apparently had told her to call if he hadn't called her by then. +++$+++ 1970s
Yes, sir, I am. +++$+++ 1980s
Just wait one fucking minute. +++$+++ 1990s
You wanna know? Turn on the T.V. Watch the fucking news! +++$+++ 1990s
I never hurt them. Never. +++$+++ 2000s
You wanna get coffee for two hours or something? We'll go next- +++$+++ 1970s
Tell me. +++$+++ 1990s
Make it out to cash! +++$+++ 1930s
Then what's the premonition of the lake supposed to mean? +++$+++ 2000s
Yes. +++$+++ 2000s
How often do you go? +++$+++ 1980s
Shit Honey, you could've told me. People might think it's about us! +++$+++ 2000s
Get <u>out</u> of here! +++$+++ 2000s
Why would you help me? +++$+++ 1990s
I didn't do anything.  It just happened. +++$+++ 1950s
If I knew where they were you wouldn't have to find them, would you? +++$+++ 2000s
Thank you.  Now, do you remember seeing any vehicles traveling near the site, on your way to or from? +++$+++ 1990s
Don't be crazy, mama. Take care of yourself. +++$+++ 1990s
No, thanks--I'm doing this on my own. +++$+++ 1990s
What'd I tell you? It doesn't catch fire! +++$+++ 1980s
You can't sell this to your friends. +++$+++ 2000s
It must be some kind of a gag. +++$+++ 1940s
Thirty minutes to break the code... Two hours for the five mechanicals. The seventh lock...that's out of my hands. +++$+++ 1980s
...again. +++$+++ 1940s
No, man, what we swingers were rebelling against were uptight squares like you, whose bag was money and world domination. We were innocent, man. If we'd known the consequences of our sexual liberation, we would have done things differently, but the spirit would have remained the same.  It's freedom, man. +++$+++ 1990s
<u>What</u>? Oh no! Better it was me. There isn't another good tomato within a hundred leagues. +++$+++ 1980s
Next Christmas. Is he Santa Claus who has left a present for Dorothy? What was it? An ear? Another ear?!!  What was it? +++$+++ 1990s
Oh, good. +++$+++ 1970s
Kirsty... Kirsty? +++$+++ 2000s
Why not? Why the fuck not? +++$+++ 2000s
I called your house. +++$+++ 1980s
Okay, okay, I'll be at the resta... +++$+++ 1990s
As long as you don't act like a fuckin' nut, we'll be just fine. +++$+++ 1990s
Cornelius has developed a brilliant hypothesis - +++$+++ 2000s
Bridge washed out—around Dawson. +++$+++ 1930s
Oh, Dear God, I should have guessed... +++$+++ 1980s
You know. +++$+++ 1990s
It looks old.     Did you get it a long time ago? +++$+++ 2000s
Yeah. Call him. +++$+++ 1990s
You know what gets me?  Those guys who went to the moon!  To the moon, boy! +++$+++ 1970s
No, no, no. +++$+++ 2000s
He's not responsive -- +++$+++ 2000s
Darling. +++$+++ 2000s
That first night with Pike. I made the mistake of letting him sit down at around 0300. +++$+++ 2000s
I might see you in Norfolk over the weekend. +++$+++ 1980s
Oh.  Well -- I'm not sure -- but you might try the First Presbyterian. That's on Allan Street. +++$+++ 1960s
Done.  Lets not talk about it anymore, let's have a good time. +++$+++ 1990s
We need him back. +++$+++ 1990s
Why'd you invite me here? +++$+++ 1980s
Where's the handle? +++$+++ 1980s
Is he with the girl? +++$+++ 2000s
We didn't talk about it -- you did. +++$+++ 1960s
I -- I don't know, dear... Perhaps there's some mistake. +++$+++ 2000s
That's 'Fronkonsteen.' +++$+++ 1970s
How about you? All right? +++$+++ 1990s
What did you say that for, Sarah? +++$+++ 1960s
"This is the story of Jimmy Bones/Black as night and hard as stones/Gold plated deuce, like the King of Siam/Got his switchblade loose, and a diamond on his hand..." There's the switchblade and there's the diamond.  Don't know where the deuce is parked. +++$+++ 2000s
Last night?  I was at home. +++$+++ 1990s
Yeah, why not? We're the good guys. +++$+++ 1970s
Do you know who this is? +++$+++ 2000s
Man, after taxes, lawyer fees, and paying off my daddy's bad credit, we didn't end up with a million.  We bought this house and I spent the rest on this.  It's the bomb, huh? +++$+++ 2000s
Where? +++$+++ 1940s
Helen... excuse me, we... +++$+++ 1990s
Was it ever a topic of conversation between the two of you afterward? +++$+++ 1980s
You rally think this'll draw the parent? +++$+++ 1990s
Everyone's.  This is a lawsuit.  We need to be able to contact the plaintiffs. +++$+++ 2000s
I've always denied the legend that you were in 'Our American Cousin' the night Lincoln was shot... +++$+++ 1950s
I was in it. +++$+++ 1950s
I'm a man. +++$+++ 1970s
That's a lot of people to die unknown. +++$+++ 1970s
What?!  Did you know that!? +++$+++ 1980s
Dad! +++$+++ 1990s
A whip?  Now that's going too far!  Some of these women have no shame! +++$+++ 2000s
What was I wearing? +++$+++ 2000s
...they... <u>you</u> know... +++$+++ 1990s
Let me tell you something.  Listen to me. +++$+++ 1990s
You just did. +++$+++ 1990s
I'm going after Dad. +++$+++ 1980s
Out in back. +++$+++ 1990s
Not me.  You work too often with the same people and you become friends -- clouds your judgement. +++$+++ 1990s
They never do, Mr. Barker. +++$+++ 1980s
It's going to be a long night.  It could take hours before we know something.  You should try to eat. +++$+++ 1990s
Who is it? +++$+++ 2000s
"As he loosened his manhood from beneath his robes, The Bishop muttered a Latin prayer. And then -- with a mighty thrust -- drove it into her very entrails --" +++$+++ 2000s
Because "Dr. Grant" isn't looking for Eric. Dr. Grant is looking for the coast. +++$+++ 2000s
We'd better go outside. Quickly. +++$+++ 1990s
How many fucking sources they think we got?-- +++$+++ 1970s
Here's a suggestion. Let's stop worrying about the concert for the time being and get the cops in on this Volvo situation. +++$+++ 1990s
Not without the name of the contact who can discount the bonds.  I may need to pry that information out of her.  What do you stand to gain? +++$+++ 2000s
He took it like a man.  Toss him in that drainage ditch. +++$+++ 2000s
Tell me something, Wes.  Are you crazy, greedy, or just stupid?  Jaeger says you're crazy. +++$+++ 1990s
Alright. You want some pie? +++$+++ 2000s
Okay, everybody, listen up! +++$+++ 1990s
She trusts me.  She'll do what I say. +++$+++ 1980s
What did you find? +++$+++ 2000s
Drew called from the AStar, they're still two minutes away. +++$+++ 1990s
Miles, I gotta tell you something. Victoria's coming to the wedding. +++$+++ 2000s
Been trying to figure out your secret. +++$+++ 1990s
I need your help, Joyce. +++$+++ 1980s
Some flies?  I think this qualifies as way more than "some." +++$+++ 2000s
You suggest what? I have no time for piddling suggestions from mumbling job applicants, my good man. Besides, Dr. Lester will see you now. I think that's what he said. +++$+++ 1990s
It doesn't say th... +++$+++ 1990s
She has no real grip on reality. +++$+++ 1990s
And I'd take it out on him. +++$+++ 1990s
Well, after the war, with so many of the town's boys killed, people around here didn't much feel like going to the movies, I guess.  Some of 'em moved away -- Los Angeles, Sacramento, San Francisco.  Wasn't much to keep 'em here, I expect. And now with this "television" thing -- people just aren't going out as much as they used to. +++$+++ 2000s
Yeah, fuck 'em.  No offense. +++$+++ 2000s
So you were stealing their honey. They should have killed you. +++$+++ 1980s
Hey, don't I get an encore? +++$+++ 1980s
Do you want to sit there, Jeff? +++$+++ 1980s
Sixteen. Well, nearly sixteen. +++$+++ 1980s
All right, love ya ma. Listen, before ya go just give us the goods, eh? +++$+++ 1990s
You are saying, in effect, that this is a forgery? +++$+++ 1930s
I don't know about you guys, but I'm starting to feel a really sexual vibe here. +++$+++ 2000s
My undying love.  Have some. +++$+++ 1980s
Yeah, they sure do make a lot of cold, hard, noise, Captain. +++$+++ 1960s
So what would a weekend in the country be without sex? +++$+++ 1980s
It was a wonderful set. +++$+++ 1970s
Yeah, pretty well. +++$+++ 2000s
Oh, I need your notes from the classes I missed. +++$+++ 2000s
-- is not a challenge. I need something I can sink my teeth into, professionally speaking. +++$+++ 2000s
Somehow, you're better. Different. You're getting ready to go. And I say... +++$+++ 2000s
Maranzano will think Masseria ordered the hit, and won't have no choice but to start the war. +++$+++ 1990s
Nothing like a little liveliness. +++$+++ 1990s
Is it gassed up? +++$+++ 2000s
Who? +++$+++ 1990s
I can't afford to get caught. +++$+++ 1990s
So then, tonight, we go over everything thoroughly, eh?  Especially the new papers - +++$+++ 1940s
Where was the call from. +++$+++ 2000s
Oh.  Like I'm not an interesting person. +++$+++ 1990s
Dr. Burton tells me you know who Batman is. +++$+++ 1990s
That's 'cause he's dead. +++$+++ 1990s
Selina ... more facets than Vicki, huh?  Funny, but sort of mysterious... +++$+++ 1990s
Oh, my God! +++$+++ 1990s
And how much are these? +++$+++ 1990s
They're trying to come through the door! +++$+++ 1970s
Shut up!  Sorry, dear, I lost control for a minute. +++$+++ 1990s
I'm sorry about Saturday, Dad.  It was just impossible to get away. +++$+++ 1980s
What did you see? +++$+++ 1980s
Shut up.  Cuff him to the rail. +++$+++ 1990s
Are you going to tell me you didn't feel something in there? +++$+++ 1990s
I can only stay for one drink, Ben. I've got to meet with Victor. +++$+++ 2000s
It's ok. +++$+++ 1990s
I got a hunch, Joe Buck, it's gonna be easier for you than most. +++$+++ 1960s
Nepal? Have you been? +++$+++ 1990s
Maybe just one word? Kaput? Because you're kaput, Price. +++$+++ 1950s
You've come far. You're a good man. I love you. +++$+++ 1990s
Maybe the demons are real. +++$+++ 1990s
The park? +++$+++ 1990s
Yes. +++$+++ 1990s
What? +++$+++ 1980s
I'll try to manage. +++$+++ 1990s
Never mind. +++$+++ 2000s
That's OK. +++$+++ 1990s
Wait a second, Hoffy. Schulz says he's our best friend. Maybe he can give us a little hint. +++$+++ 1950s
There's our shaving stuff - and there's Sugar. +++$+++ 1950s
They let you out? +++$+++ 1990s
Come on! We're wasting time! +++$+++ 1930s
Behind us? +++$+++ 1980s
It explains a lot. +++$+++ 2000s
He hadn't even been there. And all those years I thought he was dead. +++$+++ 1990s
Don't worry about anything, Frankie Five-Angels. +++$+++ 1970s
After their initial investment in the factory, Grendel didn't need them.  Told them to fuck off. They tried to get these C.D.s together in order to have proof of Grendel's involvement, so they could keep him in line.  Now's the fun part... +++$+++ 1990s
Sure. +++$+++ 1990s
But you can't think through this one.  You have to feel it. +++$+++ 1990s
I'm starting to understand what you're teaching me.  I mean the panties and the nostrils and all that shit...I mean I'm getting it-- +++$+++ 1980s
Behind me.  Over there. +++$+++ 1990s
I broke the man out of prison -- +++$+++ 1970s
They are? +++$+++ 1970s
If you want a partner, I think you should recalculate the split. +++$+++ 1990s
Can I ask you a question totally unrelated to your career? +++$+++ 1990s
We have to lose the window. +++$+++ 2000s
Four interviews. Four no-gos. +++$+++ 2000s
Did anyone in your family keep in touch with her? +++$+++ 1990s
They don't have anything except four walls and a roof, and that's all we need. +++$+++ 1990s
Data's positronic net contains classified information on the Enterprise. Command codes, security protocols... +++$+++ 1990s
Well yes -- you know that about George. +++$+++ 1970s
What friend is that? +++$+++ 1980s
I said, I've been real tired. +++$+++ 1970s
And without much discrimination. +++$+++ 1990s
I wish I'd had the chance to get to know him better.  Take him fishing or something. +++$+++ 2000s
What?! +++$+++ 1990s
I couldn't say it any better than Huxley. +++$+++ 1990s
I know you. This Shari is a passing fancy. +++$+++ 1990s
Hurry, Lynette. It's almost midnight. +++$+++ 1980s
That was my idea. +++$+++ 2000s
You don't know how glad I am to see youl +++$+++ 1950s
Maybe I ought to go out there. +++$+++ 1990s
You know, you're not a <U>bad</U>-looking girl. In fact--I think you're lovely. +++$+++ 1930s
Mussolini is raping Sicily like every Roman before him. So our brothers are coming to America. Soldiers willing to fight and die. Men who know the meaning of honor. +++$+++ 1990s
I beg your pardon . . . ?  Some gratitude. +++$+++ 2000s
What? +++$+++ 2000s
'Hell, I may as well do something useful. +++$+++ 1990s
I do not understand... +++$+++ 1990s
The kid needs a man to show him -- +++$+++ 1980s
Aye. Speak then if ye must. +++$+++ 1990s
Let's try it again, only this time I'm going to stick my tongue in your mouth. When I do that I want you to massage my tongue with yours. That's what first base is. +++$+++ 1990s
We'll try again. +++$+++ 1960s
That'd be fine, Bobby. +++$+++ 1990s
I love that dream. +++$+++ 1990s
Now what? +++$+++ 1990s
Flies the plane.... +++$+++ 1980s
Fuck band practice... If you're gonna be a painter you're gonna have to break a few hearts – you don't wanna be like Tony Bennett.. +++$+++ 1990s
This lot's got to be worth 50 quid! +++$+++ 1990s
--my number one fan. +++$+++ 1990s
Morpheus. +++$+++ 1990s
But you say he hasn't shown up, you think he backed out? +++$+++ 1990s
Baseball? +++$+++ 1940s
Once it's spent you won't have to worry about it. +++$+++ 1990s
You swore.  You owe me a quarter.  Did you remember my egg carton?  I told you I needed my egg carton for seed planting today. +++$+++ 1990s
What do you mean by haul?  What are you not telling me here? +++$+++ 1990s
You won. +++$+++ 2000s
Better get him to a hospital. +++$+++ 1960s
Mine. +++$+++ 1990s
Who is who? +++$+++ 1990s
I care about you, a - But I just don't have those kind of feelings for you. I'm sorry. I'm not in love with you. +++$+++ 1990s
Is there a coup de grace in here, somewh... +++$+++ 1990s
I think Mister Worf is suggesting that we go outside for a little stroll... +++$+++ 1990s
Sure.  And the two of 'em used my legs for a wishbone.  Nearly snapped me in half. +++$+++ 1990s
I'm all right. +++$+++ 2000s
Shut up, dear boy- no gloating allowed. +++$+++ 1980s
Why? You can't even lift one. +++$+++ 1980s
Haven't seen her since that day. Ella thinks she might be waiting in the woods for another chance but..I don't think so. Mama thinks she's gone for good. Says she can feel it. +++$+++ 1990s
It's fine by me, Jesse. +++$+++ 2000s
Yes.  Is this something that I can talk ab... +++$+++ 1990s
You son-of—a—bitch, I'm going to kill you. +++$+++ 1990s
I didn't say nothin' 'bout credit, Mr. Howard. +++$+++ 1970s
-- murdered by pirates is good -- +++$+++ 1980s
What's the first street? +++$+++ 1990s
Ted, I'm leaving you. +++$+++ 1970s
Don't you know? Everyone on Rura Penthe is here for life. +++$+++ 1990s
You gentlemen care for a drink? +++$+++ 1960s
I've enjoyed being man. +++$+++ 1970s
Hey. Tits. I'm taking your neighbor to the country. maybe something for you too. +++$+++ 1990s
You've certainly thought this out, haven't you? +++$+++ 1980s
Yes? +++$+++ 1980s
It's like sweet and sour, and salty butter. +++$+++ 1990s
Is that right? +++$+++ 1990s
Probably just some exec ducking an ex-wife. +++$+++ 1980s
On a scale of one to ten: two. But --  -- she'll take care of you, Myers. She's a tough one. +++$+++ 2000s
It is possible... and I know this isn't something you want to hear. Your daughter may have tried to hide a note where she thought you would eventually find it, but where she knew your husband would never find it.  She might have wanted to tell you something... +++$+++ 1990s
I had it coming from someone. +++$+++ 2000s
The hell with that. No one's gonna tell me who I can and can't work with. +++$+++ 1990s
What? +++$+++ 1990s
The hospital. +++$+++ 1990s
Professor Waldman. +++$+++ 1930s
Damn, you're a shrewd one. Shrewd. +++$+++ 1980s
Cool! +++$+++ 1990s
Please... no?  You mean "not here" -- that's it? You're a private Available but particular.  Don't worry. There's no one here but me. And you. +++$+++ 1970s
Well, shoot! Maybe there was! +++$+++ 1950s
Where do you get off pretending to be my secretary? +++$+++ 2000s
Thank you.  This was so unnecessary.  I hope you've noticed that Otis isn't barking as much.  We keep him in at night. +++$+++ 2000s
And there's the winner of the Truman Capote look-alike contest. +++$+++ 1970s
Are you all right, Shelly? +++$+++ 1980s
That was fun. +++$+++ 1990s
Just, if you will, confine yourself to the main building. It's nearly bedtime. +++$+++ 1970s
Wouldn't know what to do with it all -- +++$+++ 1990s
Not all of us, 007. +++$+++ 1990s
Now there you are completely wrong. If we sit down for a little chat, I'm sure we won't run out of conversation and what's more it won't be dull. +++$+++ 1930s
I don't know...  ...maybe it depends on what you were like before you... +++$+++ 1990s
Bastard bit my chopper. +++$+++ 1990s
They check in alone? +++$+++ 1990s
I guess I thought I was protecting you. +++$+++ 1990s
You said, "Will it change..." Wife. Will it change... +++$+++ 1970s
Calm?... He doesn't seem so to me... He was awake all night. +++$+++ 1960s
Honey? +++$+++ 1970s
We want to frighten you away.  So that you'll move out. +++$+++ 1980s
Just my church and my boys. We all had to go to school and learn hand talking. I just thank the Lord they can see. +++$+++ 1970s
That is correct. And how do I decide? +++$+++ 2000s
Well, see, I was talking to Mr. McAllister about my leg and everything... and how I still want to, you know, do something for the school and -- +++$+++ 1990s
--These circumstances are mitigated. Right now. They're mitigated. +++$+++ 1990s
Okay. Let's get serious. Of course I know the Cult of Good is not good. Ever since I saw what they did in Atlanta, it has been my mission to expose them. I've followed them to Oasisburg and soon will have enough hard evidence to bring them to real justice. That computer disc could be the final piece to the puzzle. This isn't just a story, Selina--another damn Pulitzer--this is my life. +++$+++ 2000s
How old are you? +++$+++ 1990s
INT. POSTAL VAN - DAY +++$+++ 1990s
We played backgammon? +++$+++ 1990s
Oh well, you know. +++$+++ 2000s
What am I supposed to do? +++$+++ 1980s
Larry Mitchell found out.  So you killed him. +++$+++ 1990s
Yes. +++$+++ 1990s
No. +++$+++ 1980s
Whatever you do to me... no matter what you'll make me right.  Every word I have spoken will be confirmed. +++$+++ 2000s
A blockbuster. But quality. No mutants or maniacs. This one's gonna be my "Driving Miss Daisy". +++$+++ 1990s
Sure. How about the beach? +++$+++ 1990s
They told me I was too old to serve. +++$+++ 1990s
Of course. She is my sister. I tell her almost everything. +++$+++ 1980s
I'd sure like that favor you offered a while back. +++$+++ 1990s
No, no – +++$+++ 1990s
That's right. And guess who's the new King of the Unemployment Line. +++$+++ 2000s
Whatever happened to that old saying "Love Thy Neighbor." +++$+++ 1950s
I'm not, but alot of my soldiers are. Glass the planet ! +++$+++ 1990s
When you get scared, the brain releases a chemical, same chemical it releases when somebody's...  in high school, the thing to do was to take the girl to a scary movie. +++$+++ 1990s
And, fine, alright, and fine... what are <u>you</u>doing, this whole time? +++$+++ 2000s
Sorry. I'm better with men. +++$+++ 2000s
All of the James Gang's encounters have been with local law enforcement who, quite frankly, are no match for this group's cunning. +++$+++ 2000s
'Message from command.  Would you like them to send in the HKs?' +++$+++ 1990s
Did I? I tried so hard! I really concentrated! Oh, I'm so happy! +++$+++ 2000s
Ed, you said you were getting permission. +++$+++ 1990s
How are we going to live, Wolfi? Do you want me to go into the streets and beg? +++$+++ 1980s
As large as castles.  You are still light as air, one hundred men can't move me. +++$+++ 1990s
Or twenty-four as it is in Earth time. Furthermore, if you will reveal yourself, your enemies will have a way of getting at you where you are vulnerable: by hurting the people you care for.  Ah, this Earth...this world you live in, Kal-El...  Resist its temptations, its rewards, especially its political system. +++$+++ 1970s
You see -- the electricity's been neutralized -- all over the world. +++$+++ 2000s
Butt-munch. +++$+++ 1990s
Yellow's a bad color for me.  I'll look green at breakfast. +++$+++ 1980s
Magda? She's not my grandmother -- actually she rents the apartment right next to mine. Her husband passed away a couple years ago so she doesn't like to be alone. +++$+++ 1990s
In an hour they're gone! +++$+++ 1990s
I'm aware that I don't look so great, but I thought you'd be glad to see me. +++$+++ 1980s
So we don't know for sure about you, either. +++$+++ 1990s
You sure you're OK Teddy? You're not bowling are you? +++$+++ 1990s
That sounds nice. +++$+++ 1990s
Hardly. +++$+++ 1930s
Commander?... Call me Laredo? +++$+++ 1990s
I think I can stabilize the fields around the singularity, that should prevent another power drain. +++$+++ 1990s
What's your real name? +++$+++ 1980s
So what did he say when he called? +++$+++ 1990s
You assemble this, on the instant, from these few observations? +++$+++ 2000s
Howard Hunt? ... Jesus Christ, you open up that scab ... and you uncover a lot of pus. +++$+++ 1990s
Forgive me, Don Bobadilla -- those positions have already been taken. +++$+++ 1990s
Looking for someone? +++$+++ 2000s
Maybe the maid did it. +++$+++ 1990s
I think they shoot right outta its mouth, hook you, and pull you right in.  Good thing we stopped it before it killed anybody else. +++$+++ 1990s
No, I'm fine.  I'm...  ... wonderful.  Just walking down the street with you again. +++$+++ 2000s
What I'm saying, they're getting some help. +++$+++ 1970s
What do we know? It was first sighted off the French Polynesian Pacific. An area that has been exposed to dozens of nuclear tests over the last thirty years. +++$+++ 1990s
Your daughters went to the prom. +++$+++ 1990s
Because they get outstanding settlements. And Mother is determined that this time there's no turning back. +++$+++ 2000s
Cute? +++$+++ 2000s
I'm so tired -- DR. DREYFUSS Here -- drink this. +++$+++ 1960s
Let's discuss it when I'm unbound. +++$+++ 1990s
I... +++$+++ 2000s
Funny? +++$+++ 1940s
I should be in by two. +++$+++ 1990s
And dogged when I set my mind to something. +++$+++ 1990s
I have to see somebody. +++$+++ 1980s
No, but I've confirmed the reelection rally is the target.  How much C-4 is missing? +++$+++ 1990s
I saw that Colonel's Huey on the point -- +++$+++ 1970s
While you were employed at Wyant Wheeler, you did everything you could to make sure no one knew you were an active homosexual, correct? +++$+++ 1990s
An "automaton"?!  Please!  I'm a biomechanical organism.  Well, what's left of one.  What's left of all of them, actually.  I am the last...  ... And "these fragments I have shored against my ruins."  T.S. Eliot.  You wouldn't know him yet but you'll just love him, he's divine, if a little dour.  Very shy though... hiding over here... +++$+++ 2000s
How much time do we have? +++$+++ 2000s
Big case? +++$+++ 2000s
Andy! +++$+++ 1990s
See?  You could have raised a million dollars, put on a sixty thousand dollar flop and kept the rest. +++$+++ 1960s
Creed's great. +++$+++ 1970s
What? +++$+++ 1990s
You got some mighty fucking fine bad timing Adam. We got a rehearsal situation here. +++$+++ 1990s
I'm not honest? +++$+++ 1990s
Well, I got the idea when I was doing some research and I discovered that Cook's Chicken used to be called Coon's Chicken, and so I decided to do my project based on this discovery as kind of a comment on racism... and the way racism is whitewashed over in our culture... +++$+++ 2000s
Do you feel you have a chance? +++$+++ 1970s
I do love you.  Let's get lost together. +++$+++ 1990s
Have fun storming the castle. +++$+++ 1980s
They'll have to come right past us. +++$+++ 1990s
<u>How</u>...? +++$+++ 2000s
No. You know too many sick ladies. +++$+++ 1970s
Are you saying this filthy godless son of a pig knows where to find The City Of The Dead? Truly? +++$+++ 1990s
We have much to discuss.  Tomorrow. +++$+++ 1990s
Oh!  You're here. +++$+++ 1980s
Then I will teach you. +++$+++ 1980s
He's a riot. +++$+++ 1980s
Just what makes you and them Krauts so buddy-buddy? +++$+++ 1950s
Yeah, we just watched a few movies. Took a few notes. It was fun. +++$+++ 1990s
He was a...good lover? +++$+++ 1990s
Nice. +++$+++ 2000s
You're terrible. +++$+++ 1990s
Yeah, but... +++$+++ 1990s
I'll see you there. +++$+++ 2000s
Oh, but I just told you. -- +++$+++ 1940s
Yes I did, I'm sorry. +++$+++ 1970s
Then stand there an' wait till I'm done -- Creed's good, yeah, he's real fine but I gotta boy, y'know Big Dipper, who's got the stuff it takes to be a champ -- He's mean, quick, an' big -- What more d'ya need? Okay, go to work...  Hey -- Yeah -- Whatta ya want? +++$+++ 1970s
Aniline dyes in the inks in felt-tip pens -- which is what Lecktor has -- are transparent to infrared. The Tooth Fairy's ballpoint isn't... +++$+++ 1980s
I thought opening too quickly was a fatal mistake in chess. +++$+++ 1990s
Now look -- here's a list of the people I invited -- they're all the right kind of people -- or did I miss anybody? +++$+++ 2000s
Geller, we've been over this. You're a great copy editor. Maybe my best copy editor. You're not a reporter. +++$+++ 1990s
Birdy-- +++$+++ 2000s
Zeke.  Git! +++$+++ 1930s
Baryonyx? +++$+++ 2000s
No. no. no. Wait. Wait. +++$+++ 1990s
I <u>must</u> go. +++$+++ 1930s
Everything breaks at once. +++$+++ 1980s
I didn't do it. I didn't do it. +++$+++ 1950s
Yes. +++$+++ 1990s
Bullshit yourself! +++$+++ 1980s
You never had The Talk, did you? +++$+++ 1990s
Used to be against the law, didn't it? +++$+++ 1970s
I drink. +++$+++ 2000s
Is the wind tired out there? +++$+++ 1930s
Were you wicked? +++$+++ 1990s
Michael...  Do what you can. +++$+++ 1990s
They are...it happened in tonight's quake.  It happened just fifteen minutes ago. You must've felt it. +++$+++ 1990s
Aw, find yourself a shoplifter to roll. +++$+++ 1970s
You can see me now. +++$+++ 1990s
Very nice. +++$+++ 1980s
Then what? +++$+++ 1920s
I have to get you home by one. +++$+++ 2000s
I won't do it because he wants me to do it, even if I want to do it. +++$+++ 1980s
What the fuck is that? +++$+++ 2000s
Come on.  Let me buy you something to eat.  Looks like you could use the company. +++$+++ 1990s
You got caught. It's all fun and fuckin' games till you get caught. But now we gotcha. OK, Mr. Elliot actor, you've just made the big time - +++$+++ 1990s
You wanted to become a member of the most powerful clique in the school. If I wasn't already the head of it, I'd want the same thing. +++$+++ 1980s
Let's just kill them. +++$+++ 1990s
How do you mean? +++$+++ 2000s
Could be she's just a nice, respectable girl -- there are millions of them. +++$+++ 1960s
That morning.  He was talking to me and Leon about marriage. +++$+++ 2000s
No. +++$+++ 1990s
How soon can I get a plane to Seattle? +++$+++ 1990s
Well, there's a dead cat over here on the edge of my lawn, Louis. I think it might be your daughter's. +++$+++ 1980s
That's bullshit. Just shoot. +++$+++ 1980s
Good to meet you, Dr. Wigand. +++$+++ 1990s
You afraid of violence? +++$+++ 2000s
Well, of course, right... +++$+++ 1990s
What are you talking about -- "don't get emotional." If you ask me, you haven't gotten emotional ENOUGH about this man. _ 98. +++$+++ 1990s
Baby, don't talk like that, baby. +++$+++ 1990s
Yeah, yeah.  Jesus. +++$+++ 2000s
Seven homes along the Black River so far... +++$+++ 2000s
The reason I called is -- I won't be home for dinner tonight. The branch manager from Kansas City is in town -- I'm taking him to the theatre Music Man, what else? No, don't wait up for me -- 'bye, darling.  Tell me something,  Baxter  -- have you seen Music Man? +++$+++ 1960s
No.  Your cabbie is floating down a storm drain or stuffed in the trunk of a cab. +++$+++ 2000s
The boys and I were just having a philosophical discussion about women and cigars. Some interesting connections there, don't you think? +++$+++ 1990s
In what way? +++$+++ 1990s
Is it okay? +++$+++ 1990s
I can't. +++$+++ 1980s
I don't believe you. +++$+++ 2000s
How much? +++$+++ 1990s
Have you considered my offer? +++$+++ 1990s
Well? +++$+++ 1980s
Wouldn't think of it. Because tomorrow...  We're going to the chapel and we're... +++$+++ 1980s
Are you two gals all funny with each other? +++$+++ 2000s
Hi ma. +++$+++ 1990s
Yeah!  He'd kill for you Dave.  He likes you.  Your mind. +++$+++ 1990s
Jam is jam! It's just jam! +++$+++ 1980s
Jesus... +++$+++ 2000s
What can I do for you? +++$+++ 2000s
...the disciplines: bondage, domination and humiliation. +++$+++ 1970s
Well, I've flown seven million miles. And I've been waitin' on people almost twenty years. The best job I could get after my bust was Cabo Air, which is about the worst job you can get in this industry. I make about sixteen thousand, with retirement benefits, ain't worth a damn. And now with this arrest hanging over my head, I'm scared. If I lose my job I gotta start all over again, but I got nothin' to start over with. I'll be stuck with whatever I can get. And that scares me more than Ordell. +++$+++ 1990s
Wait, dear boy. Just wait. Hand me those pliars. +++$+++ 1980s
The house is rented in your name. +++$+++ 1990s
You found your way to us and we weren't easy to reach, were we? +++$+++ 1930s
She's ready. +++$+++ 1980s
I think that's what's happening... +++$+++ 1990s
Oh sure. The American answer to everything. Pills.  No, this is --  -- natural. +++$+++ 1980s
I love you. +++$+++ 1990s
So what's in a name?  I wanna join him.  I don't see why we can't join him. +++$+++ 1990s
Don't give up on me now, Dean. +++$+++ 1990s
You know. Your love machine... the throbbing thrill hammer... your thing! +++$+++ 1980s
They nail him for it bad ? +++$+++ 1970s
Photographer? +++$+++ 1990s
Sure but what good will that do? +++$+++ 2000s
Stop it. I'm... +++$+++ 2000s
Okay.  Alright.  Okey-dokey.  Now, we need the nanobot.  The nanobot that initiated the reaction.  Once we have that we can stabilize the meltdown.  Simple really.  No problem. +++$+++ 1990s
Sir, I understand this is a terrible breach of protocol, but please, I beg you to hear our plea. We are Thermians from the Klatu Nebula.  Our people are being systematically hunted and slaughtered by Roth'h'ar Sarris of Fatu-Krey. Sarris wants the Omega 13. We are to meet in negotiation. However our past efforts in this regard have been nothing short of disastrous. The flames, the death...  Please Captain, you are our last hope.  We have secured a limousine. +++$+++ 1990s
Until Thursday, then, Contessa Mio. +++$+++ 1960s
Get a tricorder. You're going to have to track my exact position in that room... +++$+++ 1990s
In Ruhengeri? +++$+++ 2000s
They have security cameras.  Rooney would see you coming. +++$+++ 2000s
Afraid I'd give Mitch. +++$+++ 1960s
With Hypnocyl? +++$+++ 1980s
That's what I have to believe... +++$+++ 1980s
Which way did he go? +++$+++ 1990s
You are the younger of two... +++$+++ 2000s
You're not...an orphan are you? +++$+++ 1980s
Like? +++$+++ 1970s
Well, now, you just know all there is about bein' a mechanic, don't you?  Didn't you read the sign. +++$+++ 1990s
The Council has ordered a halt to the Ba'ku relocation while they conduct a top-level review. +++$+++ 1990s
You're not my list. +++$+++ 1990s
Yeah.  I'm her father. +++$+++ 1970s
But Professor -- +++$+++ 1980s
Oh no, Jam. I'm not falling for that twice. +++$+++ 1990s
Really? +++$+++ 2000s
I wanna go home. +++$+++ 1980s
I'm afraid that's not true.  Will you want me to stay on till Monday? +++$+++ 1980s
Are you related to the deceased, Mr. Chance? +++$+++ 1970s
We're outta here. +++$+++ 1980s
Yeah, they're bad for your health.  I'm tryin' to look out for you... +++$+++ 1990s
How did you learn English? +++$+++ 1970s
But you're a doctor. You kill people every day. +++$+++ 1990s
You are.  Now. +++$+++ 1980s
Takes a licking but keeps on ticking...  ... For a while anyway. +++$+++ 2000s
Detective Williams!! Detective Williams!! +++$+++ 1980s
Goodnight. +++$+++ 1940s
It's just a feeling.  Don't you sense it, too? +++$+++ 2000s
I want your feelings about it. +++$+++ 1970s
And you, M'sieu Giron, seem to be disturbing my examination of <u>this</u> <u>report</u>. +++$+++ 1930s
One: "We want freedom. We want the power to determine the destiny of our Black Community." Two: "We want full employment for our people." Three: "We want to end the robbery by the white man of our Black Community." Christ, they're asking for reparations... +++$+++ 1990s
When there's something to move, it's too easy not to.  Do you know how many colleges are in a twenty mile radius? U. Mass, Amherst, B.U.... +++$+++ 2000s
Charlie, take your gum, stick it under your ass and keep it warm. +++$+++ 1980s
I don't know. +++$+++ 2000s
There was a brown dog that ran across the road up there, right by the dump, and Dolores slowed down not to hit him, and he ran into the woods.  And then Dolores drove on and turned onto the Marlowe road, as usual.  I remember that.  I'm remembering it pretty clearly. +++$+++ 1990s
We may go out for coffee after the meeting so don't expect us before midnight. +++$+++ 1990s
No.  Not even you. +++$+++ 1980s
Know what? +++$+++ 1970s
Why do people think I'm Tyler Durden? +++$+++ 1990s
Oh, no sir-ee.  If yo don't have a reservation you can skip to ma-loo. +++$+++ 1970s
Well, in that event, it would be good manners on the part of the other man to let him have her. +++$+++ 1930s
Thirty years. Maybe more. +++$+++ 2000s
When this ship docks, I'm getting off with you. +++$+++ 1990s
People pay good money for that? +++$+++ 2000s
Then go. +++$+++ 1980s
I think I got one today. +++$+++ 1990s
Mitch?  Do... do you think they'll be all right? In the trunk? Can they breath? +++$+++ 1960s
Oh my God! She's two-timing PRINCIPAL COLLINS! +++$+++ 2000s
I ain't talkin' about you, I'm talkin' about me. And I'm a-stayin'. I give her a good goin' over all night long-- and I'm a-stayin'. +++$+++ 1940s
Cyril! +++$+++ 1930s
How're you doing, Sarge? +++$+++ 1980s
Hardly new news. +++$+++ 1990s
Good Lord.  So the construction guys say it'll take about a week to fix the roof. Damn airline better not fuck us on the shingle match. +++$+++ 2000s
Anyone with taste, anyone with breeding.... A gentleman, would choose British racing green, with maybe a tan interior...but when you buy a red car, with a black interior and wire wheels, you have one thing on your mind and one thing only and I'm too much of a gentleman to say what that one thing is...in front of the children. +++$+++ 1990s
That must be the tenth alienist they've had on Williams. Even if he wasn't crazy before, he would be after ten of those babies got through psychoanalyzing him.  Gimme the desk. +++$+++ 1940s
Then just give me one of your explanations that all three of us'll buy. +++$+++ 2000s
What happened at that signing? +++$+++ 2000s
... yeah, then, but... +++$+++ 1990s
They look pretty smart, I think. +++$+++ 1990s
Ever heard of the Mary Celeste? +++$+++ 2000s
You're out! I'm not working with either one of you! +++$+++ 1990s
...They  gave  Dude  a  beeper,  so whenever these guys call-- +++$+++ 1990s
Why don't we go take a swim? +++$+++ 1980s
You are, I was about to say, no longer eligible. +++$+++ 1980s
I probably woulda busted on you too... and what a shame that woulda been. +++$+++ 2000s
Agent Lowry? +++$+++ 1990s
Was that Meredith? +++$+++ 1990s
Look Anne, you're not serious about this, are you? +++$+++ 1930s
No. But when he's in that car... +++$+++ 2000s
Then we'll be right where we are now. +++$+++ 1990s
You'd be killing a friend.  Don't you know how much I like you? +++$+++ 1970s
You do seem much more disposed toward him than I understand, Ernest. Did I miss something? +++$+++ 1990s
Sure. +++$+++ 2000s
I know I was acting funny---I'm sorry. It's just...I miss it. +++$+++ 1980s
And, and, and, I did it.  And I put a kid through school. She...and...Cold calling, fella. Door to door.  But you don't know. You don't know.  You never heard of a streak.  You never heard of "marshaling your sales force..." What are you, you're a secretary, John.  Fuck you.  That's my message for you.  Fuck you and kiss my ass. You don't like it, I'll go talk to Jerry Graff.  Period.  Fuck you. Put me on the board.  And I want three worthwhile leads today and I don't want any bullshit about them and I want 'em close together 'cause I'm going to hit them all today.  That's all I have to say to you. +++$+++ 1990s
Fine. +++$+++ 2000s
Rodger Young, prepare to receice outgoing fire...!  I'll take the first group. +++$+++ 1990s
You have a recent scar on the back of your hand. +++$+++ 2000s
Well.  It's for you. +++$+++ 1990s
Too much excitement. How about the surrey. Can you fix it? +++$+++ 1940s
Who? +++$+++ 1980s
Okay that hurt. +++$+++ 2000s
The killer was trying to get to her. That sorority girl was a distraction. +++$+++ 1990s
Show off.  Hey, boss tune.  "Come Fly with Me." +++$+++ 1990s
Now you must listen to me. This force is like a parasite, or a virus. It feeds on doubt, suspicion, discord... you must clear your mind as we reach out for her. +++$+++ 1990s
Republican? +++$+++ 1970s
Don't tell me it's not the gas!  Your mother thought she smelled gas. +++$+++ 1980s
Then what is it? +++$+++ 1990s
Have I got things to tell you! +++$+++ 1950s
It could be a man. +++$+++ 1940s
Terry Valentine. +++$+++ 1990s
We have been in difficult places before, haven't we? +++$+++ 1940s
I have to help out in my father's hardware store. They're giving me sort of my own hours for a while, which is nice. +++$+++ 1980s
Hartman, if you take this desk out of this building, I'll put you behind bars. +++$+++ 1940s
Okay, Mom. +++$+++ 1980s
So... everything sounds... wonderful? +++$+++ 2000s
When you say this funny feeling, you mean the state of mind brought on by the treatment they gave you? +++$+++ 1970s
Now get talkin' +++$+++ 2000s
You're a shit. +++$+++ 2000s
You gotta shave before you leave the house in a dress like that and I don't mean your legs.  Why didn't you jump on her?  What's happening to you? +++$+++ 1990s
Do you think I'm having a good time? Do you think I'm just *teasing* you? Do you think I *know* whether I want you or Wally? +++$+++ 1990s
You're all packed.  And here's your bus ticket. You're on your way back to St. Anne's. +++$+++ 1950s
And break her heart and mine? +++$+++ 1990s
I want a chopper on the roof in three minutes. To Meigs Field.  At Meigs have them warn up and flight- prep the Gulf Stream. +++$+++ 1980s
Maybe - just 'maybe' - when their ship doesn't return - they'll decide not to come here, after all. +++$+++ 1950s
Good morning. What does this mean? +++$+++ 1930s
Borrowed. +++$+++ 1990s
He could let you have your vacation. +++$+++ 1990s
What are you doing! +++$+++ 1980s
What do you think, dumbshit? +++$+++ 2000s
Well, sub us, then, mate. I'm expecting a rent cheque. +++$+++ 1990s
But surely, Professor, you don't intend we disregard the more... philosophical works. +++$+++ 1930s
Lighten up. +++$+++ 2000s
Just doing my job. +++$+++ 1990s
Pinot Grigio.  We're considering it for the appetizer. +++$+++ 1990s
Yes, sir. +++$+++ 1960s
That judgment is not more important than their right under agreement with Webb to defend their farms & families... Major Heyward was at John Cameron's. He saw what it was. +++$+++ 1970s
...This'll sometimes help. +++$+++ 1990s
I can look and see. +++$+++ 1970s
Clemenza promised Rosato three territories in the Bronx after he died, and then you took over and welched. +++$+++ 1970s
From the magazine? +++$+++ 1970s
Hi. +++$+++ 1990s
So what happened to the barbecues, and fishing? +++$+++ 1990s
Larry, I don't know how to say this, but I think we got a shark problem. A real one. +++$+++ 1970s
That would be a catastrophic mistake. +++$+++ 2000s
The answer is NEVER, Ted, NEVER. Except maybe in your dreams. +++$+++ 2000s
I guess it is. But I personally wouldn't care to be head of a business that kept losing money. That wouldn't be common sense. Incidentally, where is the $180,000 coming from? +++$+++ 1930s
I said the plan was right here. +++$+++ 2000s
What's baseball? +++$+++ 1990s
You there? +++$+++ 2000s
He wasn't going to shoot her, you murdering son of a bitch! +++$+++ 1990s
Of course I will. +++$+++ 1980s
Is that why you're with him? +++$+++ 1990s
I'm doing a piece on right-wing groups, post Oklahoma City. I hear you're an important figure in those circles. You have a lot of interesting ideas.... +++$+++ 2000s
And what did they say about me? +++$+++ 1960s
How did you do that, Mrs Spitz? +++$+++ 1990s
I can't take shorthand. +++$+++ 1940s
Dr. Woodly. +++$+++ 1970s
Better ask Paul D. +++$+++ 1990s
What is it, Max? Want to wash the car, or are you doing a little spying in your off hours? +++$+++ 1950s
Nobody ever said that -- There's his picture. +++$+++ 1970s
Nuwanda?  Please? +++$+++ 1980s
I don't know... please... tell me I'm dead... +++$+++ 2000s
I can explain. +++$+++ 1990s
I'm getting to your rug. My  father and I don't get along; he doesn't approve of my lifestyle and, needless to say, I don't approve of his. Still, I hardly wish to make my father's embezzlement a police matter, so I'm proposing that you try to recover the money from the people you delivered it to. +++$+++ 1990s
I only met Kurtz once. +++$+++ 1970s
We'll use smoke pots. Like the Army uses. +++$+++ 1960s
I'll take you home, Angela.  Why don't you leave those with us for a while? +++$+++ 1990s
And you don't know how they open, is that what you are saying? +++$+++ 1990s
Oh! Are you really? +++$+++ 1980s
Don't worry about me, baby. I just wanted you to have a good time. +++$+++ 1990s
No. And I want to be in that room a half second after Mecklen calls to say the deal's done. We've got a sheriff's task force on stand-by. +++$+++ 2000s
Who are you? +++$+++ 1930s
I don't know. I don't know what's happening. +++$+++ 1960s
She's Cuban. +++$+++ 1990s
The Red Sox were my world. I surrendered my existence to a team that couldn't win the big one. +++$+++ 2000s
That's right. +++$+++ 1980s
That's Paul Owen. +++$+++ 2000s
Me neither. See what we've got on a guy named Alan Stanwyk, okay? I need it right away. +++$+++ 1980s
Well, it was nothin' specific he said, it just seemd like it all hit him really hard, his wife dyin' - +++$+++ 1990s
I'm not picking it up. +++$+++ 1990s
No, she's going home to her family. She'll join me in a few weeks... +++$+++ 1970s
Are you safe? +++$+++ 1970s
The lysine contingency - it's intended to prevent the spread of the animals is case they ever got off the island, but we could use it now.  Dr. Wu inserted a gene that makes a single faulty enzyme in protein metabolism. Animals can't manufacture the amino acid lysine.  Unless they're continually supplied with lysine by us, they'll go into a coma and die. +++$+++ 1990s
And no vampire here has discourse with God or the Devil? +++$+++ 1990s
Presumed dead.  No one knows. +++$+++ 1940s
I've come to strike a bargain with you.  I wish to learn the power of changing. +++$+++ 1990s
Nuke...tell me something.  Did you hit me with your right or your left? +++$+++ 1980s
That right? +++$+++ 1970s
Indeed.  I'd pay for the privilege of drawing your head. +++$+++ 1990s
It hasn't adjusted. +++$+++ 1980s
Looks like at the end of the day we finally find out who's better than who, don't we, Epps?  Like I said; I expected more from you. +++$+++ 1990s
Do you really want to go back to the runt doctors in Emergency who keep telling us they can't help? +++$+++ 1990s
Why? +++$+++ 1990s
Eight-thirty in the chapel. +++$+++ 1970s
Hay? Yeah? So teach me a lesson. +++$+++ 1990s
He comes out of the cafeteria line, he's nervous, he spills his corn, and he asks you to the dance! +++$+++ 1980s
Look, I'm shot - it hurts. +++$+++ 1960s
It wasn't one thing, if that's what you mean.  I just... I can't live here anymore. I can't live where stupidity is embraced and nurtured as if it were a virtue. +++$+++ 1970s
Well -- I guess I'll have to ask her out on a date and find out what's -- +++$+++ 1960s
What ? +++$+++ 1990s
He takes a cut of our earnings and invests it for us.  He makes us quit the life at thirty.  He doesn't let us use narcotics and he doesn't abuse us.  Can your policeman's mentality grasp those contradictions? +++$+++ 1990s
That's already happened hoss. It's naive to think otherwise. +++$+++ 2000s
Careful... +++$+++ 2000s
So what is it you want to know? +++$+++ 1990s
Okay? +++$+++ 1970s
Give it up.  If you threw yourself- +++$+++ 1940s
Can you hold?  Can you try? +++$+++ 1990s
Call Dad! +++$+++ 2000s
A cold drink? Okay? +++$+++ 1960s
The search for the Cup of Christ is the search for the divine in all of us. +++$+++ 1980s
All the time. We all live in Southie. I live with three of them now. +++$+++ 1990s
Well, you know, maybe something else until this whole puppet thing turns around. +++$+++ 1990s
I told you. I have to go back into the past. Once more. For the last time. +++$+++ 1950s
And leave a tip in every hat-check room in town? +++$+++ 1950s
Yeah, sorry about that.  I had this meeting with this guy. +++$+++ 2000s
My name is Camille -- Camille Johnson and I'm the Supervisor of this school. What's your name? +++$+++ 1970s
How much? +++$+++ 1960s
"John James Urgayle."  The Chief. +++$+++ 1990s
I can use the station in Medical, keep an eye on Justin... +++$+++ 1990s
The Box, Joey.  He wants the Box. +++$+++ 1990s
Yes, they are. +++$+++ 1980s
There's no way of knowing.  Without a key -- a primer, to help us, maybe never. +++$+++ 1990s
Ever get shot at, run over, sandbagged at night because people got unfavorable publicity from your camera? +++$+++ 1950s
Did I? My mistake. +++$+++ 1990s
Of course not. +++$+++ 1990s
Crane. +++$+++ 1960s
Well, we can hope, can't we? We certainly don't have any leads. A ghost mask, a cellular phone -- not much there. +++$+++ 1990s
Yeah. Asked Rev. Pike if he could stay in the cellar. +++$+++ 1990s
Right. Tell you what -- have you caviar? +++$+++ 1980s
You walked out on a job for me, and I won't ruin that. +++$+++ 1990s
Rub a dub dub, thanks for the grub, yay God. +++$+++ 1990s
Aside from the fact that he found her on an infomercial? She said they humped like gorillas. Chutney could hear them all the way in the pool house. +++$+++ 2000s
May I wash you? +++$+++ 1990s
'Least you admit it. +++$+++ 1990s
Pardon me?  I'm afraid I don't... +++$+++ 1990s
What are you doing? +++$+++ 1950s
-- I don't care about her. Of course, I was angry. But not with you. The book is yours not mine. I was wrong, what I said about it. I hurt you, didn't I? +++$+++ 1990s
Oh, well thanks a fucking bunch. +++$+++ 2000s
Ha, ha - who are you to be talking about a mask? What do you mean? You've been wearing a mask ever since we met you. +++$+++ 1930s
Hey Butt-Head, are we gonna die? +++$+++ 1990s
...Fine. +++$+++ 1970s
You're joking...! +++$+++ 1980s
I know it sounds funny, but I'm gonna try. +++$+++ 1980s
And now you're going to eat it? +++$+++ 1980s
In the village.  Look what I found. +++$+++ 2000s
In Angola. Yeah. +++$+++ 2000s
No. I just think... anything can be explained. But Mary, doing a thing like this... I don't know how to handle... +++$+++ 1960s
Yeah. I know. +++$+++ 2000s
...home. It's getting late. Yeah. +++$+++ 1990s
If I'm lucky.  So... I won't be back until the first. Your dad will be back on Sunday, so I've put Elizabeth in charge until then. She has the car... so she can drive you to your therapy tomorrow. +++$+++ 2000s
So what are you going to do about her? +++$+++ 1980s
Here's <u>weak</u>...Mom said she was gonna talk to the <u>teacher</u> and Brad's <u>parents</u>!!  Can you <u>believe</u> the <u>humiliation</u>??? +++$+++ 1990s
I've got an idea. +++$+++ 1980s
She knows enough not to be here. +++$+++ 1950s
I'm not going. +++$+++ 1990s
And the rest of us are truck horses? +++$+++ 1930s
Whatever I got, I always got on the slide. This shot's no different. I didn't earn nothin' -- I got it on the slide... I needed ya help about ten years ago when I was startin', but ya never helped me none. +++$+++ 1970s
Goodbye. I lov... +++$+++ 1990s
Must have been all the liquor in him. +++$+++ 1980s
So like I was saying, things were going pretty well in my life. +++$+++ 1990s
Rawlston is my boss. +++$+++ 1940s
Or a stock kick of approximately 125% on shares which are currently sitting around $4.38, or, in plain English... +++$+++ 1990s
What's this stuff on the rice? +++$+++ 1980s
Back-to-back sessions with the shrink. +++$+++ 2000s
What -- ? +++$+++ 2000s
Does that start exactly at midnight tomorrow, or could you hold off for a few days maybe? +++$+++ 1980s
Well, I just feel that life'll be much sweeter for you now with me around. I promise... +++$+++ 2000s
Mother, I promise you that he won't be a reporter much longer. Once I get him away from that atmosphere and get him away from a man named Gallagher— +++$+++ 1930s
We hear this is getting to be sort of a meeting place for the Wynant family, so we figure we'll stick around in case the old man himself shows up.  Then we seen him...  ...sneak in and we decide to come up.  And pretty lucky for you. +++$+++ 1930s
Three hundred kilos of White Lady hidden inside a giant bust of Abraham Lincoln.  A parade float. +++$+++ 2000s
Wonderful!  He liked the monkey, didn't you? +++$+++ 1980s
Notice the grain. See how deep and rich the red runs? +++$+++ 2000s
This is not my usual Friday night! +++$+++ 1980s
No way... +++$+++ 1980s
Best case scenario, you're back on the payroll for awhile. +++$+++ 1990s
Basic.  Hmmm. +++$+++ 1980s
Dad! +++$+++ 1990s
You made a mistake. +++$+++ 1990s
I have a feeling I'm about to start buying my own. +++$+++ 1990s
It's too bad about your mom. At least she went peacefully, I've seen a lot of people go out the hard way. +++$+++ 1990s
Head for the fireplace! +++$+++ 1980s
May I be blunt with you? +++$+++ 1990s
I ain't never seen a cat like you. Ain't you scared talking like that in front of an ofay? +++$+++ 1990s
Okay, well... anybody else have an idea? +++$+++ 2000s
He suspects that the culprits might be the very people who, uh, soiled your rug, and you're in a unique position to confirm or, uh, disconfirm that suspicion. +++$+++ 1990s
Jeff! +++$+++ 1990s
I've given them his profile. +++$+++ 1970s
Are we all museum bigots in Maine? +++$+++ 1990s
I judge military matters, Captain Winthrop, not you. +++$+++ 1970s
Did you write it—or didn't you? +++$+++ 1940s
Or was it the time you and Jimmy Squarefoot stole the golden apples I'd forged. +++$+++ 1980s
Can I see you again? +++$+++ 1990s
I said I like all of them. +++$+++ 1970s
Keeping our witnesses alive.  We hide them, but there's a leak in the department, and they end up dead. +++$+++ 1990s
To you?  I don't think so...  What'd she say? +++$+++ 2000s
I can't see Outpost putting its reputation in the hands of people like that. +++$+++ 2000s
You wouldn't know her address, would you? +++$+++ 1990s
Yeah, yeah. +++$+++ 2000s
Oh my god, It's real. +++$+++ 1990s
Showtime. +++$+++ 2000s
Not this. +++$+++ 1990s
They sent me here, Richard because they said you didn't hold up your end of the arrangement, and I have to transport you back to Leavenworth. +++$+++ 1990s
What? +++$+++ 1990s
You've gotta ask her to the dance! +++$+++ 1980s
I know I'm going to get rapped in the mouth for saying this, but so what? +++$+++ 1970s
We still talk, though. +++$+++ 1990s
You shouldn't be fighting with that jerk. +++$+++ 1980s
Bio-<u>busting</u>.  I <u>loves</u> bio-busting. Who do I gotta kill?  Family -- right?  Obnoxious I bet.  Mommie, daddy, piglets. +++$+++ 1980s
Yes, I do. I don't have amnesia. I remember everything about myself up until the incident. I'm Leonard Shelby, I'm from San Fran - +++$+++ 2000s
Well once. Mary. +++$+++ 1990s
Well, I guess that makes you the best.  Look, Frank -- she stands to inherit three million dollars.  As executors of the estate and her attorneys that could generate a lot of legal fees for us.  All I'm asking you to do is talk to her. +++$+++ 1990s
Now hold on, I didn't say I didn't want to come -- +++$+++ 1990s
No. +++$+++ 1960s
For mankind not a thing -- for womankind the record is not quite so bleak. +++$+++ 1930s
With four of them, I didn't use any kind of protection. Wait, maybe it was three. +++$+++ 1990s
As you wish... +++$+++ 1980s
You have a King fantasy. +++$+++ 1990s
He's not bad at it. +++$+++ 2000s
Are you going to lie in that flower bed all night? +++$+++ 2000s
W-w-what has that got to do with this Maiden? +++$+++ 2000s
Meanwhile whatever you do don't fall asleep. Midnight. +++$+++ 1980s
We're going to have to work on your touch. +++$+++ 1990s
Itta Bena, now, uh, that would be... +++$+++ 2000s
Right. +++$+++ 1980s
Now why don't you let these gentlemen pass? Don't you know who's in that car? +++$+++ 1950s
Isn't it enough that I can love you? +++$+++ 1980s
Thank you. +++$+++ 1960s
Get control of yourself! +++$+++ 2000s
There's a big, comfy California King over in Bedding.  What say we ... +++$+++ 1990s
I'm honored, Dick, that you've come all this way out here to Virginia to visit us at last. +++$+++ 1990s
Wow! +++$+++ 1990s
Who? +++$+++ 1920s
Carolyn! +++$+++ 1990s
How was the concert? +++$+++ 1950s
So then this isn't crazy.  It's a sure bet. +++$+++ 2000s
But I'm Miss Jessica's nurse, Alma. You don't have to do that for me. +++$+++ 1940s
Hey, pretty nifty, huh? +++$+++ 1940s
A lady. She died. +++$+++ 1990s
Nice disguise. +++$+++ 1990s
Well, then, w-who was? +++$+++ 1970s
I'm sorry, this can't wait. +++$+++ 1980s
Doctor Hegel tells me he discussed the Vietnam POW syndrome with you. +++$+++ 2000s
Bobo, no, I -- +++$+++ 1990s
Why? +++$+++ 1970s
Let me guess, she couldn't handle the cop thing -- never knowing if you were dead or alive.  I've seen it a million times. +++$+++ 2000s
What are you thinking? +++$+++ 1950s
One-three Zebra. Zebra three, I need you. +++$+++ 1990s
But, of course, there's nothing self- serving in that scenario. +++$+++ 1990s
Krueger? +++$+++ 1980s
I left the training early. +++$+++ 2000s
Is it true? +++$+++ 2000s
You didn't really believe me, did you? +++$+++ 1960s
Your life flashing before your eyes? +++$+++ 2000s
39   CONTINUED: +++$+++ 1990s
You know honey, I've finally figured out a way of bilking enough money from the school to get us that condo in Waikiki. +++$+++ 2000s
Just spit him back out.  Some shall live, some shall die, arbitrarily, sound like any higher power we know? +++$+++ 1990s
Forget it. +++$+++ 1970s
Mrs. Robinson? +++$+++ 1960s
We're not giving up, Thelma. +++$+++ 1990s
Nonsense, my friend. I can look on anything I like. And I am particularly fond of looking on crucifixes. +++$+++ 1990s
GOT THE HOT FLUSH SYMPTOMS AND I'M FEELING FREAKY +++$+++ 1980s
Yes! +++$+++ 1930s
They may have found her.  Mrs. Cortez -— this morning I told her Jacqueline was no longer under my care. +++$+++ 1940s
I'm not going to report it. +++$+++ 1990s
They give me fifty dollars when they turned me loose. I spent up some of it on ridin' the bus and eatin' french-fried potaters. +++$+++ 1990s
This isn't the time or the place to get into it, but there is, for just one example, a certain former colleague of mine, who made a very big mistake, a life mistake.  I think the lesson there is that, old and young, we ail make mistakes, and we have to learn that our actions, all of them, can carry serious consequences.  You're very young, Tracy underage, in fact -- but maybe one day you'll understand. +++$+++ 1990s
That the bombing in Dallas may have been to destroy the bodies of those firemen, so their deaths and the reason for them wouldn't have to be explained -- +++$+++ 1990s
Even later. +++$+++ 1980s
I hope I don't find any little hairy things living up here -- wait! There is something! If I can just -- yes, I'm getting it -- a case of some sort -- it's heavy. +++$+++ 1960s
Not the window - I can't bear the light anyway - no, I can see all the way to the desert.  I've found the lost fossils. +++$+++ 1990s
I'm only telling you what I've heard...  Haven't you ever wondered what your seed-mother was Like...? +++$+++ 1970s
What's in there, David!? +++$+++ 1970s
No -- it feels wonderful.  I've held that axe up for ages.  Oh --- +++$+++ 1930s
But I thought he came over to America before the war. +++$+++ 2000s
I vote for the hammock. +++$+++ 1980s
Whoa, I knew you were going to say that.  I absolutely anticipated that, Nick.  But I said to myself, Charlie, Charlie, we can move up on this, so go find Nicklaus... He'll be pissed for a moment, but then it'll dawn on him -- +++$+++ 1980s
Why? +++$+++ 1970s
Very well, madam. I suppose you can't be blamed for being suspicious with so many scoundrels and rouges of the night about. Alex walks away from door, then ducks into the bushes where the others are hiding. They put on their maskies and follow Alex round to the rear of the house. +++$+++ 1970s
I think we better go home. +++$+++ 1990s
It's wonderful. Then why don'tcha get William F. Buckley to kill the spider? +++$+++ 1970s
Was it like good sex or was it like bad sex? +++$+++ 2000s
Because I don't want one. +++$+++ 1980s
They've had a little car trouble. I'm afraid they won't be here until after dark. +++$+++ 1990s
Way out of anything, man. Just keep your pecker up, your powder dry, the worm WILL turn. How many days you short? +++$+++ 1980s
I don't know shit about you. +++$+++ 2000s
I want to talk to you, Michael. +++$+++ 1970s
Oh, I know. But I didn't, really. Honestly, I didn't. There was only one, but he's out of town and leave no forwardin' address. +++$+++ 1990s
Yes. +++$+++ 1990s
Look, I care about the humans who are dying, not you, got it? +++$+++ 2000s
Another what? +++$+++ 2000s
It's too late now.  Guests are arriving.  The Mayor's car is pulling up. +++$+++ 1990s
What are you doing in my room? +++$+++ 2000s
When did you get in? +++$+++ 1990s
Have you never been caught in a similar situation? +++$+++ 1930s
Sure we could run him. You realize he's already head of his block association. +++$+++ 1970s
What are they doing in the middle of nowhere? +++$+++ 1990s
I'm here. +++$+++ 1990s
If Mulwray was murdered, she was probably one of the last people to see him. +++$+++ 1970s
Hey, peaches. +++$+++ 1990s
LZ is two clicks North of a cabin, you are to split into teams of two and work your way through your designated area blasting as many targets as you can find! Each area has twenty targets, first team to take all twenty and find the cabin wins! Teams are as follows -- Dunbar and Nunez, Pike and Mueller, Kendall and Childs! +++$+++ 2000s
Thanks.  You're not bad yourself... +++$+++ 2000s
We have something for your mother, for Sonny, we have the tie for Fredo and Tom Hagen gets the Reynolds pen... +++$+++ 1970s
I guess it is eight forty-two. +++$+++ 1930s
But you was going to fight for me. +++$+++ 1970s
Sure, meet me at the top, we'll start the paperwork. +++$+++ 1990s
Believe it. +++$+++ 1980s
That's what you said the first time we met.  You didn't even know me. +++$+++ 1990s
Is that the one where the guy had knives for fingers? +++$+++ 1990s
Sounds wonderful. +++$+++ 1980s
I can't dude! We all took a sacred oath, and swore ourselves to secrecy! +++$+++ 1990s
Yes, Ma'am. +++$+++ 1990s
Now all you have to do is hold the chicken, bring me the toast, charge me for the sandwich, and you haven't broken any rules. +++$+++ 1970s
...Ray stole a shitload of money from Marty. Until both of 'em calm down I'm not getting involved. +++$+++ 1980s
I always figured I'd live longer without it. +++$+++ 1950s
Well, whatever the fuck it is, she used it. And then the spray perfume. You know, the real sweat kind -- and, on top of that, get this, right when we're crossing the Tri-boro bridge -- she changes her pantyhose! +++$+++ 1970s
Hey, where did you come from? +++$+++ 2000s
And people are actually fooled by that? +++$+++ 1990s
It would be worth the risk. +++$+++ 1990s
Here, take this out to the table. +++$+++ 1980s
What can I do for you, Mr. Kirby? +++$+++ 2000s
Huh? +++$+++ 2000s
I'm glad you care about us, Kicks. Sometimes that gets kind of lost in the racket -- +++$+++ 1940s
Timezit? +++$+++ 1970s
You must make the time.  Where do you go off to in the lunch hour? +++$+++ 1990s
But -- you have to go out there! I'll give you more than your one third!  When I get paid... just take the fall!  You're too hurt to fight and the man's a killer! +++$+++ 2000s
What? +++$+++ 1980s
And? +++$+++ 2000s
If I knew you any better I'd say that doesn't sound like you. +++$+++ 1990s
Now let's get this settled— +++$+++ 1930s
I wouldn't let happen. +++$+++ 1990s
I said you're going to get a phone call. +++$+++ 2000s
This isn't an animal, Vince.  I've been on this case four months, remember?  I've learned a few things. +++$+++ 1990s
I'm a tramp  Meet your new father. The whole nation is laughing at us! +++$+++ 1990s
You didn't! +++$+++ 1970s
I couldn't help. +++$+++ 2000s
I'm sure it won't be long now. +++$+++ 1970s
I've got a job. +++$+++ 1990s
I am. +++$+++ 1990s
He still hasn't shown up. Why aren't you in class? +++$+++ 1990s
You better? +++$+++ 2000s
Healing plant use among the Ki tribe of Bechuanaland has been cancelled to make room for Tibetan Erotic Art. +++$+++ 1990s
Look, Mr. Charnier, you got to be reasonable. +++$+++ 1970s
Physical? +++$+++ 1990s
If it'll make you feel any better I won't do it again. +++$+++ 2000s
I just wanted to know if you're involved with anyone?  Let me ask you something?  Do your colleagues know if you're involved or not? +++$+++ 1990s
If you don't see it, it's not real... +++$+++ 2000s
He read the letters, Nick. Some day I wasn't there. He went through my room. He found your letters. +++$+++ 2000s
My brother is gonna shit. +++$+++ 1980s
And I know people. +++$+++ 2000s
You don't know what you're talking about. +++$+++ 2000s
I'm not sorry for what I said. +++$+++ 2000s
You're nothing!  You're nobody!  You're a stupid dream.  Well all dreams come to an end. +++$+++ 1990s
There'll be three, four men at the most.  I have some backup, nothing will happen. +++$+++ 1990s
What? +++$+++ 1950s
The traffic takes some getting used to. +++$+++ 2000s
Now, Swana... +++$+++ 1930s
It looks fine. How much will it be, with my car...? +++$+++ 1960s
Isn't this fun? +++$+++ 1990s
D'Amour. +++$+++ 1990s
The sooner the better. +++$+++ 2000s
Relax. I'll do right by him. You know that. +++$+++ 2000s
It's Dudley for the Nite Owl. +++$+++ 1990s
Then maybe you should get your glasses checked. +++$+++ 1980s
How do you know it was Williams? +++$+++ 1980s
Cutting edge mathematics. Think tanks. The kind of place where a mind like Will's is given free reign. +++$+++ 1990s
There's a big difference between the most popular girl in the school and dead sperm. +++$+++ 1980s
I'm not Bill Mitchell. +++$+++ 1990s
Okay. +++$+++ 1990s
Last night? +++$+++ 1980s
Well! +++$+++ 1970s
Well, I hope you like these! Fresh sea urchin wrapped in seaweed. Or "nori" if you prefer. I love sushi. +++$+++ 1990s
Good morning, Quince. +++$+++ 1990s
Any sign of Sounder? +++$+++ 1970s
It's the only vein I know.  I tell the facts the way I see them.  And any man that knows that facts - +++$+++ 1940s
Sir, all potential customers have been informed of the delay.  Fur-... +++$+++ 1990s
Do you want us to come with you? +++$+++ 2000s
Who says that I'm protecting anyone? +++$+++ 1980s
Mr. Lebowski is disabled, yes.  And this picture was taken when Mrs. Reagan was first lady of the nation, yes, yes? Not of California. +++$+++ 1990s
I'm sorry, I don't recall meeting anyone who fits that description. +++$+++ 1990s
Just like old times, ain't it? +++$+++ 1990s
He gives me a total boner! +++$+++ 2000s
I don't know what to say. +++$+++ 2000s
How 'bout Lonnegan? +++$+++ 1970s
That is so sad -- +++$+++ 1990s
Maybe I'll just order a burger, Barney, that way I can eat with my hands. +++$+++ 1990s
Queer. +++$+++ 2000s
I'm not going back in there. I told ya this was a one way trip. Now stand aside. +++$+++ 1970s
Yeah. I'll check. +++$+++ 1980s
No.  He's just a guy who's got a nose for this shit.  Like you. +++$+++ 1990s
No. I should go. +++$+++ 1990s
... There can be no whitewash at the White House ... two wrongs do not make a right.  I love America.  God bless America and God bless each and every one of you. +++$+++ 1990s
You've got your six guns strapped on.  You're ridding off on another adventure?  Oh, my God, it's all real...it really is real.  I should go with you.  Please... +++$+++ 1980s
What's happenin'? +++$+++ 1990s
You OK, Bob? +++$+++ 1990s
I can't regotiate. +++$+++ 1990s
Yes that's the whole point. This is what I was put on this earth to do. Rape the town that raped my mother. Steal its pristine innocence like it stole hers. I've planned this since I was a very little boy. You have no real freedom either. Your father has cast a shadow that you've never eluded. +++$+++ 2000s
You have any children? +++$+++ 2000s
It had been deemed classified. +++$+++ 1990s
I -- I thought he was but... an impostor who resembled -- +++$+++ 1990s
Uh-huh.  Anyway, I'm thinking Easter, 'cause I just fucking love pastels. +++$+++ 2000s
What's going on with the beaches, Chief? +++$+++ 1970s
Madmartigan, I need your help. +++$+++ 1980s
You say that just to flatter me. +++$+++ 1960s
Find the feet? +++$+++ 2000s
...there are notations every thirty seconds... +++$+++ 1980s
Do you think they bought it? +++$+++ 1990s
...Hello? +++$+++ 2000s
The Morlocks didn't build this. +++$+++ 2000s
But you know, I should  really be the one going . +++$+++ 1990s
Yeah, okay. +++$+++ 1980s
Aw, don't tell me you're growin' scruples. +++$+++ 2000s
Front page.  Washington Post.  Tomorrow. +++$+++ 1990s
So what's the plan today? +++$+++ 2000s
A timer. +++$+++ 2000s
I'm still five.... +++$+++ 1980s
What are you waiting for? Do something. +++$+++ 1940s
You were in my way. +++$+++ 1990s
Excuse me. +++$+++ 1990s
Let me go, Dil +++$+++ 1990s
Huh? +++$+++ 1930s
Oh, gee, I don't know.  Um... +++$+++ 1980s
Ready. +++$+++ 1980s
Can I come in? +++$+++ 1980s
We head north, begin the grape tour up there, make our way south so the more we drink the closer we get to the motel. +++$+++ 2000s
Yeah.  That's how you end up with a 400 billion dollar deficit. +++$+++ 1990s
Plissken, slow down the sub. You're overloading the power plant. +++$+++ 1990s
He offered you money? +++$+++ 1980s
Granger and Pitts have one hell of a caseload... and I would have thought with Jetson here being the first Newcomer plainclothes, and Hubley's body being found over in the Newcomer community... +++$+++ 1980s
.Jeffrey!. Nobody wanted you to leave school and go to work in the store. maybe going back to school will be an option one day. I hope so. +++$+++ 1990s
Nothin'... You want to go for a drive? +++$+++ 1990s
Some kind of circuitry...? +++$+++ 1990s
Tippi-tippi-tim, tippi-tim, Tippi-tippi-tan, tippi-tan...  Gotta dime for a crippled-up docker? +++$+++ 1950s
She took them kids with her? +++$+++ 1950s
Juno! God, you startled me. What are you doing here? What's wrong? +++$+++ 2000s
What? +++$+++ 2000s
You know it's been over a year since we kicked it last?  Up at the family reunion. +++$+++ 2000s
Let's say a 10% finder's fee? +++$+++ 1990s
Mom.  I gotta talk to you. +++$+++ 1950s
Dude here. +++$+++ 1990s
Yes? +++$+++ 1990s
I mean…Your Majesty, they do not, they have not, but I believe there is one who can +++$+++ 1990s
For very long? +++$+++ 1970s
Wait till you see this -- we have the whole house to ourselves... +++$+++ 1990s
I can't do it anymore. +++$+++ 1990s
Anyway, they had to take her to Bellevue.  Maybe she'll stay this time. +++$+++ 1990s
Seconds.  Three, four. +++$+++ 1990s
The choices I made have led me here as well. This is the only home I have ever known. I cannot foresee a reason for leaving. +++$+++ 2000s
He likes her better than me. +++$+++ 1990s
Thank you. +++$+++ 1990s
We were suite mates. +++$+++ 2000s
I have to get back. I'm having dinner with the Danvers. +++$+++ 1980s
We are simply respecting the terms of the Seventeen Point Agreement. +++$+++ 1990s
Good.  You conquer the demon, but your horse is sinking in the bog.  What do you do? +++$+++ 1980s
But what makes a thought start? +++$+++ 1940s
Admiral Dougherty will not be joining us for diner. Deploy the collector.  Do you have a problem with those orders? +++$+++ 1990s
I'm listed. +++$+++ 1990s
That's how Congress--or any large body--is run. All work has to be done by committee. +++$+++ 1930s
<i>We gotta go to work, Domino.</i> +++$+++ 2000s
Do it! +++$+++ 1990s
It could be extremely useful to jog his memory. See if he remembers anything new the next day. And I'll have the test results back in a few days. +++$+++ 2000s
Almost. Want to sit up?  What's the matter? +++$+++ 2000s
I need a cigarette. +++$+++ 1990s
Everybody likes to be as good as their word. +++$+++ 1970s
Turned that place completely around.  180 degrees. +++$+++ 1990s
Yeah -- and nothing else.  That shock you? +++$+++ 1980s
Why wasn't I told? +++$+++ 1990s
Listen, I would - +++$+++ 1990s
Abbott and I used to do a lot of that in the spring. +++$+++ 1990s
Sure I do. +++$+++ 1980s
That's what turns me on about you, Dwight. You're so smart. +++$+++ 2000s
We're just alike. You think sex is so unimportant you don't do it. I think sex is so unimportant I don't care who I do it with. +++$+++ 1970s
It's as though he'd trapped a real cuckoo inside. +++$+++ 1980s
No more backward, if you ask me, than the way these hotshot assholes fuck us, then ditch us.  Don't you ever feel used, Paula? Don't you ever feel like if this is all you get for your trouble then the sonofabitch ought to be paying for it...? +++$+++ 1980s
I want to talk to her again, that's all.  See what would happen under, you know, normal circumstances. +++$+++ 1990s
Oh yeah,...I mean no. NO! I won't settle down! Not this time!... +++$+++ 1990s
You're pawning The Rock?! +++$+++ 2000s
'S all right, Grampa. You just kind a tar'd, that's all. Somebody fix a pallet. +++$+++ 1940s
I've thought of leaving, going to Chicago or New York, but... +++$+++ 1990s
Here you are, Senator. Not a bad desk, either. Daniel Webster used to use it. +++$+++ 1930s
[Beat] I know it doesn't make sense. It doesn't even make sense to me. +++$+++ 2000s
I'm sending.  Do you hear me? +++$+++ 1970s
What are we gonna see? +++$+++ 1990s
...excuse me.  Can you fix this? +++$+++ 1990s
My...wings... +++$+++ 1990s
He does it all by himself. +++$+++ 2000s
What does this have to do with my testimony? +++$+++ 1990s
Why? +++$+++ 1990s
It's from both of us.  Of course you'll have to drive it around the lot until you get your permit -- +++$+++ 2010s
When's the next Jumbo? +++$+++ 2000s
Don't you know?  How they're talking about you? +++$+++ 1990s
Just a night out.  Sounds like she can't say no to her daughter. +++$+++ 1990s
Victor. This has got to stop.  Nobody's seen you in months. You haven't attended a single class. +++$+++ 1930s
Whatever. +++$+++ 2000s
He's my sister's kid. No papa. Not too bright. Personally, I think he's a retard. I only gave him the job as a favor for my sister, you understand? +++$+++ 1990s
Well, let's find him. +++$+++ 1990s
Go! +++$+++ 1990s
Indeedldid, MyLord. Itwas one ofthe first to cross. +++$+++ 1970s
Fucker! +++$+++ 1990s
He's not here.  It's a blind alley. +++$+++ 1990s
You better believe I can.  I'm sick of people telling me what I have to do. +++$+++ 1990s
Oh no. She's here. I brought him along. And my daughter, too. We're staying at Peterson's... +++$+++ 1990s
Oh! +++$+++ 1980s
"... by the emperor of Rome.  This writer asks:  between a Senate that debates truth until they choke, an Emperor who has the birth sign of a woman, is it possible there is more virtue within the arena than without?" +++$+++ 2000s
What work? +++$+++ 1990s
You closed him yesterday. +++$+++ 1990s
Sorry. My life isn't that interesting. I go to work. I go home. I don't know what to say. +++$+++ 2000s
I don't believe it. +++$+++ 1990s
Remember -- we can't take more than five minutes to get out. +++$+++ 1960s
Lots of people... +++$+++ 2000s
Let me just clarify a few things.  I don't care what kind of cop you are in China, you have no jurisdiction in America.  Without me you are just another tourist. +++$+++ 1990s
About a year. +++$+++ 2000s
It's Janine Melnitz, from my staff.  She's one of my most valuable employees. +++$+++ 1980s
I want to say something. +++$+++ 1970s
You know what I'm talking about. +++$+++ 1990s
It depends on the quality. And, that it be Indian. +++$+++ 1990s
Sounds familiar. +++$+++ 2000s
You know him? +++$+++ 1990s
Since last night. I was pleased to see you. +++$+++ 2000s
Pam Grier. +++$+++ 1990s
Great to be here. +++$+++ 2000s
Yeah. +++$+++ 1990s
...that’s our war room. We did seven major deals last year, three of them hostile. +++$+++ 2000s
But not now. +++$+++ 1930s
Here's one by a man that's very much alive. +++$+++ 1970s
What happens if I can't catch him? +++$+++ 1990s
That's right and I'll smash your face for you, yarblockos. Slide of watch shop. +++$+++ 1970s
What are you saying? +++$+++ 1960s
You don't have an investigation without me.  You got that? +++$+++ 1990s
They can't impeach me for bombing Cambodia.  The President can bomb anybody he wants. +++$+++ 1990s
I'm sure you're quite willing to be decent about this. +++$+++ 1930s
A pass? How you gonna give me a pass? A witness can put me at the crime scene. +++$+++ 2000s
Yes, I did. +++$+++ 1980s
I don't get it. +++$+++ 1990s
If I thought I could get away with it - +++$+++ 1990s
Yes. +++$+++ 1980s
That's not important now, Elaine.  We have to talk. +++$+++ 1980s
No, I haven't heard. +++$+++ 1970s
He wanted to know how you used to like your eggs. +++$+++ 1990s
I don't know what the fuck you're doin'. You're givin' us a ride. +++$+++ 1990s
What are you talking about? +++$+++ 1990s
Sure. +++$+++ 2000s
The maitre d' called you Christine. +++$+++ 1990s
Leave him alone, Lennon, or I'll tell them all the truth about you. +++$+++ 1960s
Sh-h-h Nancy. The other children. +++$+++ 1940s
I am.  Please come with me.  I don't want to do this here. +++$+++ 2000s
Tomorrow night. +++$+++ 1990s
Stop fighting and get out. +++$+++ 1990s
My only fear is that the Zulu will avoid the engagement +++$+++ 1970s
Am I cool now? +++$+++ 2000s
That's good. +++$+++ 1970s
I sprayed your apartment. I took your key. I really didn't mean to do anything but see you. +++$+++ 1980s
You're late. +++$+++ 1980s
Why? +++$+++ 1990s
Yes, it's on the stove... +++$+++ 1990s
I moving more to Communism now it's dying out. +++$+++ 2000s
See, we're getting along famously! +++$+++ 1930s
Okay, Sandy. +++$+++ 1980s
I believe he is probably lying. +++$+++ 1980s
Make your teeth yella -- +++$+++ 1970s
You're a little old to be a school boy aren't you brother.  Cool it! You're probably not the only one they've gone after. Stall a little so they believe you're for real. Make them trust you.  Hey Tyrone, you figure feeding our children is gonna make The Man jumpy? +++$+++ 1990s
I can hear myself starting out. "Your Honor -- I have a friend who's an amateur sleuth, an one night, after a heavy supper --"  He'd throw the New York State Penal Code right in my face. -- And it's six volumes. +++$+++ 1950s
You invented Space Paranoids? +++$+++ 1980s
Of course not. +++$+++ 1970s
I do!!! +++$+++ 1970s
Sixteen 'C', why? +++$+++ 1980s
This is our world you're entering.  You may see things -- feeding.  Just remember why you're here. +++$+++ 2000s
Shut up! +++$+++ 2000s
It -- it doesn't matter, Mother!  He is dead now!  Dead! +++$+++ 1990s
Hope. +++$+++ 1970s
English! English, you stupid little retard! We America now, Tina! +++$+++ 1990s
Then we don't know if she's part of this or not.  Mickey, you up? +++$+++ 2000s
So now I see where you're coming from.  Just because we ain't rapping about Gucci, Timberland, Rolex, Benz, Cristal, ho's and bitches, we're pseudo. +++$+++ 2000s
I've got a pretty good idea. You're here to kill me, so kill me. You want me to be afraid, but I'm not. I don't care who you are, or why you two killed my husband... +++$+++ 2000s
Then tough luck, George, because you are. +++$+++ 1990s
Shhhhhh...  Thank you, gentlemen... I'll look after her now... +++$+++ 1990s
AGAGAH!! +++$+++ 1990s
Well, I'm coming to it. It seems the Professor had to have a gun to re- enact the crime with -- and who do you suppose supplied it? Nobody else but that great thinker, Sheriff Hartman! +++$+++ 1940s
Ahm right, right, I liked the bit in space very much.  Did you enjoy making 	that bit? +++$+++ 1990s
We think he's had a change of heart.  So we should be celebrating. +++$+++ 1990s
We own a small family grocery store. +++$+++ 2000s
She doesn't want me around +++$+++ 1980s
A very short while, Uncle. I've been given permission to stay only a few days. +++$+++ 1960s
So I can't talk to some broken down actor, what do you think, I'm going to tell him I'm screwing Lester Karpf! +++$+++ 1970s
Not have it. +++$+++ 2000s
Thank you very much. +++$+++ 1930s
Why'd he come in our camp. +++$+++ 1990s
You said he was dead. +++$+++ 2000s
...in a really horrible way. +++$+++ 1980s
Tell, tell, tell me again. +++$+++ 1990s
I never been to a commune. I don't know. I saw pictures in a magazine, and it didn't look very clean to me. +++$+++ 1970s
God, Viktor.  Why do you always have to make things so difficult for yourself? +++$+++ 2010s
I *can't* wait, McGann! You go into that room and tell Jim Taylor and Joe Paine that I give them *one more minute*-- +++$+++ 1930s
Not "whatever."  It's two different things. +++$+++ 2000s
Shift to your left. +++$+++ 2000s
DO IT! NOW -- ! +++$+++ 2000s
So we have two choices.  Either our suspect came back to the murder scene for a drink of water and I don't know anybody that thirsty or...  ...he <i>is</i> here.  We test again.  You're right, Hugo, this was a desperate act.  Someone had a lot to lose that night--perhaps their place in line.  I'd like the profiles of everyone with an upcoming mission. +++$+++ 1990s
Around... +++$+++ 2000s
I'm sorry, that damn conference-- +++$+++ 1990s
Airborne. That's where they used to get us agents from. Now we get 'em from Carnegie-Melon, Ivy League. Accountants and computer whiz-kids. Yuppies with guns.  That's scary shit. +++$+++ 1990s
You mean Camp Sixty-Nine. +++$+++ 1990s
Uh, so head for the other end of the tunnel. +++$+++ 1990s
This is very good for us. +++$+++ 1970s
These rooms are solid stone. They haven't changed. +++$+++ 1990s
Oh, Jesus! Did you see what god just did to us? +++$+++ 1990s
I am confused. Or maybe it's you. +++$+++ 1980s
Poppa Joe said there was only two. In and out.  Boy, you guys sure did a good job. You're good, huh? Cool masks. Where'd you get them? +++$+++ 1990s
You do not report for duty unless the Queen requests it.  You know that very well. +++$+++ 1990s
I'll find something that won't kill them. +++$+++ 2000s
Pooch, can you move it? +++$+++ 2000s
Beyond reason.  The feminist warrior will rise up in this kid, and she'll be standing over his sleeping form with a butcher knife, selecting from a short list of body parts! +++$+++ 1990s
We're on the move. Let's go. As they walk toward a corridor. +++$+++ 1980s
That was some going-over your men gave my place this afternoon. We just barely got cleaned up in time to open. +++$+++ 1940s
Dignan, he's my brother. I can't just leave him there. +++$+++ 1990s
SIN-I-FUL +++$+++ 1980s
And you weren't involved. +++$+++ 1920s
Her name is Kristen. She disappeared a couple of months ago. +++$+++ 1970s
It don't look together. +++$+++ 1990s
Might I ask why? +++$+++ 2000s
Not in your nature. +++$+++ 1990s
-- in the act. +++$+++ 1990s
Sure. +++$+++ 1980s
People have tried this before, Jake. It's never worked. Teddy Fraiser and his crew went on vacation in Chicago for it. Last year, Mumps got pinched in L.A. +++$+++ 2000s
I regret I can't spend the time I'd like with your exhibition, but I'm going to worry the life out of you when I come back. +++$+++ 1930s
Hotcha character. If I had to live with your cynicism, I wouldn't want to live at all. What you can't understand is that the creative forces of the universe are positive, not negative. +++$+++ 1990s
You in business with those guys or what?  I wouldn't want a problem for the establishment, Bern. +++$+++ 1990s
Well you're a writer, and a lot of writers are gay. Look at Truman Capote. +++$+++ 1990s
How does Mother know what I like to do? +++$+++ 1960s
Oh, yes. Come in, Paul. Rex will be right out. +++$+++ 1980s
You're late! +++$+++ 1980s
Only in your bones? +++$+++ 2000s
I've booked you in for a chest X-ray . . . just to be on the safe side. +++$+++ 1990s
Let her go. +++$+++ 2000s
I'm going to show you how to wash this tile and then you're going to do it. +++$+++ 1990s
Working the what? +++$+++ 1990s
Your parents would be crushed to think you weren't happy with it. +++$+++ 2000s
Hey, Cindy. Your friend needs help. +++$+++ 2000s
Well, until you know, you can't go. +++$+++ 2000s
The Republican Party was never home to extremists.  You should know better. This guy's as stupid as McCarthy, and McCarthy never did you any good in the long run, now did he? +++$+++ 1990s
Because it feels really incredibly good. +++$+++ 1990s
Not so far as I'm concerned, you're not.  Yes? +++$+++ 1930s
You're quicker than usual. +++$+++ 2000s
Yeah, he thinks he's evolved to a higher plane of existence, or something.  Maybe he has.  You've seen him surf... that frenzy.  It seems like anger.  It's not.  It's the energy of lovemaking.  The sea is the woman in his life.  She's his only true lover. +++$+++ 1990s
As far as the office. +++$+++ 1970s
What's the story? +++$+++ 1970s
With all due respect, detective, you can't go blaming every brutal murder in Illinois on Michael Meyers. +++$+++ 1990s
Yes I did.    Lose ends are messy. +++$+++ 2000s
Oh, he did. +++$+++ 2000s
Sit down. I don't want to trouble you, just want to ask... +++$+++ 1960s
Well, yes... +++$+++ 2000s
Well. The prom's coming up. +++$+++ 2000s
Let's go out back and have some coca while the men are talking. +++$+++ 1960s
Now wait a minute! +++$+++ 1970s
Munro is expecting him to be the good soldier in defense of British military interests. +++$+++ 1970s
Oh, confound it, man, are you afraid of success? I'm offering you a three year contract at twenty thousand dollars a year, starting today. Is it a deal or isn't it? +++$+++ 1940s
I'm out here for you!  You don't know what it's like to be me out here for you. It is an up-at-dawn pride-swallowing seige that I will never fully tell you about! Okay?! Help me help you help me help you. +++$+++ 1990s
Is it now?  Hanna?  I think we'll take our tea down by the swimming pool. +++$+++ 1990s
He asked for a loan of it, didn't he? +++$+++ 1930s
Well, you know, you don't have to tell her everything.  I mean, nothing really happened.  We just... took a walk. +++$+++ 1990s
Oh, I see. I beg your pardon. +++$+++ 1940s
I don't know. +++$+++ 1970s
No, you gotta understand, Valiant, I had nothin' to do with Acme gettin' killed.  I just wanted to sell my studio.  But they wouldn't buy my property unless Acme would sell his. And he wouldn't.  So I was gonna blackmail Acme with pictures of him and the rabbit's wife. +++$+++ 1980s
Georgia, where I come from, it's real if you make it yourself. But I been buying from the Yankee Government since they put me in this soldier suit and give me a rate. +++$+++ 1970s
Ballistic penetration shocks it, but only for a few seconds. +++$+++ 1990s
Very romantic. +++$+++ 1990s
Another hotel. Down the road. Martin lives there. He took your money. He’s got a safe...  I need a doctor... +++$+++ 1990s
Did I do good? +++$+++ 1990s
Fine, but I'm not gonna be no Bulldog Omega 5. +++$+++ 2000s
You have proof? +++$+++ 1980s
Hey,  that's... cute... Do you have a nickname, something a little... shorter? +++$+++ 1990s
One minute I'm minding my own business, the next thing I know the whole place is burning up.  An oxygen tank must've blown on the welder. Started an oil fire. +++$+++ 2000s
Shhh... Car thieves are your weakness. +++$+++ 2000s
Ellie... even if you do manage to raise the money, have you thought about what it would really mean to follow through on this?  I mean a college fetish is one thing, but we're talking about your career. You won't be publishing.  You won't be taken seriously... and you could spend your entire life looking and never find anything at all. +++$+++ 1990s
Have you told someone? +++$+++ 2000s
Don't fuck with me, Nick.  I don't need a reason to put your ass in a sling. +++$+++ 1990s
In time. +++$+++ 1970s
Let's go. +++$+++ 2000s
We don't need a new jail. +++$+++ 1990s
Jesus Christ, George, I don't see you in two years, and you show up at my door with a hundred and ten pounds of cocaine? +++$+++ 2000s
Nobody knows. +++$+++ 1980s
Yes, Patrick? +++$+++ 2000s
Wednesday, Thursday, Friday. +++$+++ 1990s
Thank you. +++$+++ 1970s
I'd like to make something clear. I don't go after a girl; a girl comes to me. Her choice. Right? +++$+++ 1970s
May I come in? +++$+++ 1990s
What is wrong with you? +++$+++ 1990s
...and the winds of destiny carry you aloft... +++$+++ 2000s
Right away, Exposition. +++$+++ 1990s
In the Arctic ice. +++$+++ 1980s
Barbara -- +++$+++ 2000s
...your sentences!  They're our sentences.  Get your mind around that. +++$+++ 1990s
You know something? +++$+++ 1930s
Why? Did you have too many and you fear it may shock me?  I won't get shocked. I'm used to this!  My father was a true pig. He fucked the bitch I'd as mother all around the apartment. Whenever a door was closed, you could be sure they were making sex behind it!  And my sister, if you didn't sleep with her, you're building's exception! +++$+++ 1990s
I breached protocol. I broke contact with the S.A.C. I ignored a primary tactical rule and left him alone with the device. +++$+++ 1990s
Like a nylon lemon peel- +++$+++ 1950s
Knight ... +++$+++ 1990s
So? +++$+++ 1990s
No, you talkin' at me. +++$+++ 1990s
If you want a ringside table, tell 'em you're one of the pall bearers. +++$+++ 1950s
Wrong number. +++$+++ 1990s
<u>You</u> left me. +++$+++ 1980s
I dunno.  What's he gonna say?  They had a fight that night, she drove away, she was upset?  I don't even know the guy. Don't get me wrong, Jenny and me were friends, but we didn't travel in the same social circles.  She had her life, I had mine. +++$+++ 1990s
Come on, now--you've forgotten all about that. +++$+++ 1930s
You just sat around drinking orange juice. Now look at you. Look how far you've come in just a few months. You got that part in that movie... +++$+++ 1990s
What the hell is the President trying to do?  Steal DeHaven's thunder? +++$+++ 1990s
The both of you. +++$+++ 2000s
I don't reckon I know. +++$+++ 1990s
Do you happen to know Gustavus Adolphus, the thirteenth Earl of Crabs? +++$+++ 1970s
Really?  I was looking at some figures from the Sickness and Accident Claims Division -- do you know that the average New Yorker between the ages of twenty and fifty has two and a half colds a year? +++$+++ 1960s
I'll give you something. +++$+++ 1990s
Because you don't really seem here. +++$+++ 1990s
Call her sister! If no one's answering at the house.... +++$+++ 1960s
From other people!  I believe she is not crazy, nor is she lying. +++$+++ 1980s
Father, are you okay? +++$+++ 2000s
It's yours? +++$+++ 1990s
By the way, Jack, this looks like a pretty straight-forward transaction to me, but we should get into it soon -- just take a few minutes, maybe up at the house ... +++$+++ 1990s
Jack's pinned down Sarah.  Should be a second.  Keep dancing. +++$+++ 1990s
Not against Castle Dugan gate, that has been off the hinges these ten years. +++$+++ 1970s
Where ya comin' from, young man? +++$+++ 1990s
I think it's time we got one thing perfectly clear, Willa. Marriage to me represents a blending of two spirits in the sight of Heaven. +++$+++ 1950s
You really want to do this, don't you? +++$+++ 1980s
No way out.  No way out.  What?  Who? +++$+++ 1960s
I think this is worth a dollar. +++$+++ 1990s
God, David. Just give it to me! +++$+++ 1990s
She's rabid, but cute. +++$+++ 1990s
Is this becoming complicated? +++$+++ 1990s
I told you, leave the boys in Washington to the boys downtown and the boys down... +++$+++ 1980s
That's how he got so big. When he quit the Marines he was just a little guy. +++$+++ 1990s
Gear? +++$+++ 1960s
Well leave then. Go to Hell. +++$+++ 1990s
My god damn foot is gone! Who fuckin' shot me? Who fuckin' shot me!? +++$+++ 2000s
Well -- other departments are, yes. +++$+++ 1990s
Now I understand why the soldier went away just before the end. That's right, just one more night and the princess would have been his. But she, also, could not have kept her promise. And...that would have been terrible, he would have died from it. So instead, for ninety-nine nights at least he had lived with the illusion that she was there waiting for him... +++$+++ 1980s
I don't recollect ever being compared to a pistol before. +++$+++ 1990s
No, I suppose not. How do you feel about your mother? +++$+++ 1970s
None.  This was arranged. +++$+++ 2000s
NO WAY! +++$+++ 1990s
How did you get him to part with it, Mr. Kane? +++$+++ 1940s
I spaced out. +++$+++ 2000s
What about them? +++$+++ 1960s
Look, girls -- I'll stay behind and hold them off. The rest of you break for it! +++$+++ 1980s
That's not possible. +++$+++ 1980s
You think I got any kind of a voice? +++$+++ 1970s
Quiet, please. Everyone. +++$+++ 2000s
I'm so sorry.  Krieger was my call.  I've never worked with him.  I'm sorry, Ethan. +++$+++ 1990s
Would someone please come over here and... +++$+++ 1990s
Aw, Long John . . . I tell you—it's no good. You're gonna get used to a lotta stuff that's gonna wreck you. Why, that fifty bucks in your pocket's beginning to show up on you already. And don't pull that on me neither! +++$+++ 1940s
Majesty... We have more than enough food set aside for your birthday celebration next week.  If we distributed some of that, we would have time to gather more before -- +++$+++ 1990s
You too big. +++$+++ 2000s
I'll give you a fucking hoot if you don't shut up back there. +++$+++ 2000s
And it's over...? +++$+++ 1980s
What, it's worse? You're pregnant with an Asian design major's child? +++$+++ 1990s
Big time.  And news travels fast. Wouldn't be surprised if the whole school knows about this one by tonight. +++$+++ 1990s
Oh! +++$+++ 1930s
You know a lot. You've taken a lot of fancy courses in colleges and that kind of stuff - - what kind of a man would kill like that? +++$+++ 1940s
About five miles back. +++$+++ 1980s
You knew Del?! +++$+++ 2000s
I'll get the doctor. +++$+++ 1980s
Don't mind the smell.  I think a rat died behind the wall... My Susie was a good girl! +++$+++ 1990s
Ohh! +++$+++ 1970s
I'm... I'm just delivering a package. +++$+++ 1970s
I just had a drive; besides, I want to see my brother-in-law Michael. +++$+++ 1970s
I'm just saying that you seem like a smart guy.  At a certain point you're gonna do something, and then there's no turning back... +++$+++ 2000s
I had a family once -- a wife, three daughters. Then a drifter named Deacon Frost came calling one evening -- +++$+++ 1990s
I need your help. +++$+++ 2000s
Energy! And when they say "Energy" what do they mean? Nuclear? too dangerous. Solar?? Too underdeveloped. +++$+++ 1980s
