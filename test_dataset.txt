Kind of crept up on you, didn't it? +++$+++ 1990s
Mom, I want to go to the fair ... +++$+++ 1990s
I know I'm better than what I've been doing the last ten years, walking around in a tank top and fuck-me pumps, waiting till it's time to scream. +++$+++ 1990s
He was the only one I wasn't a hundred percent on. I should have my fucking head examined for goin' forward when I wasn't a hundred percent. But he seemed like a good kid, and I was impatient and greedy and all the things that fuck you up. +++$+++ 1990s
I was offered that job as a waitress. +++$+++ 1990s
His father worked in a strip mine north of here.  Toby's school class went up to the mine one day.  School takes field trips up there every year.  Big day for the kids when they can see ore tore up out of the ground.  Anyway, on this particular day Toby's dad up and falls into the machinery. +++$+++ 1970s
No. it's not Don. +++$+++ 1990s
Okay -- you know what you do?  You produce a film in a commercially proven genre.  And after it's a hit, you take the profits from <u>that</u>, and make the twelve Apostles' movies. +++$+++ 1990s
Then I demand an apology! +++$+++ 1930s
And that, my lord, is how we know the Earth to be banana-shaped. +++$+++ 1970s
That's one - way of looking at it.  You might also say this guy is brainless he has no brain'. +++$+++ 1990s
Would you mind walking ahead of me to the sun porch. I feel funny about coming into a dark house. +++$+++ 1960s
Ecology.  Folks use that term for everything but what it means: who's eating who. +++$+++ 1990s
Oh! +++$+++ 1930s
Who, Laddie? +++$+++ 1980s
Where are they? +++$+++ 1990s
Joseph, the British spent thousands of pounds and precious months putting together a fleet that Arnold stopped by sacrificing a heap of old barges.  In my opinion he saved my army. +++$+++ 2000s
No, man. It wrinkles my shit. Let's grab a fuckin beer -- +++$+++ 2000s
One or two.  A grey lot.  Some social democrats.  Some diligent anti-communists.  A political section man from the US Embassy. And this exquisite Californian wine, courtesy of the CIA. +++$+++ 1980s
Then we need to do a few things right away. No Pierre. He knows, the press knows. You're going to have to keep up your schedule -- your movements are followed too closely. And we need to get these guys out of the White House. George Ball's got a conference room at State.  Reconvene over there this afternoon, come back here tonight. +++$+++ 2000s
Oh, come, man, come. Just because you've sold your soul to the devil that needn't make you a teetotaler. +++$+++ 2000s
And what, Sergeant? +++$+++ 1980s
How are you, Kelly? Would you like to take a break for a minute? +++$+++ 1990s
I'll tell those mugs to keep their shirts on, that you'll be right down. +++$+++ 1930s
Let's move your ass in there!! +++$+++ 1990s
Susie, I like this new attitude of yours.  You're growing up and I like it!  I don't like it when you're limp and dependent, when you're odd and wayward.  This gives you a chance for real survival in a very lousy world.  Because, don't forget, dear, you won't always have me with you, will you...? +++$+++ 1950s
Perfect.  How am I gonna get away from the party long enough to -- +++$+++ 2000s
Yeah. She should be at Nasa tonight. Why you lookin for him? You like him now or sometin'? +++$+++ 1990s
I don't find this "turning the tables" thing very interesting -- +++$+++ 1980s
Well, is that really true? I mean, would you really get killed just to save his life. +++$+++ 1990s
And to say you're sorry.  About this afternoon.  And the things you said. Forgotten.  Completely.  Do you understand?  Forgotten. +++$+++ 1990s
You're welcome. +++$+++ 1990s
We get... what... twelve minutes of game, and it's over? Fuck! Fuck! Fuck! Fuck!!  I'm not even supposed to be here today! +++$+++ 1990s
"Let's see what she's got," said the Captain. And then we found out, didn't we? +++$+++ 1980s
Dave, I always play square.  No bugs. I'd love you to go on the record, but I"m in no hurry.  Whenever you're ready. +++$+++ 1990s
I was. What are you reading? +++$+++ 1980s
Hungry? After twelve years in the Burmese jungle.  I am starving, Lady Agatha -- starving for a white shoulder -- +++$+++ 1950s
I'm sorry? +++$+++ 1990s
Money. How they plan to make it by emptying the reservoirs, that I don't know. +++$+++ 1970s
Okay. Thanks. +++$+++ 1970s
Please, Palmer -- if you care for me at all, don't push this now -- +++$+++ 1990s
You haven't told me where we're going. +++$+++ 2000s
Sort of half..... +++$+++ 1990s
You know what we're going to do? We're going to shoot the works. A whole week in New York. A whole week in Bermuda. The highest hotels –– the oldest champagne –– the richest caviar –– the hottest music, and the prettiest wife! +++$+++ 1940s
Jaime, do you think, when this is all over, when we're in different divisions, you think maybe you and me, we could try again? +++$+++ 2000s
If he runs, everyone will assume he took the money. +++$+++ 1990s
Is that why your brother braved coming here to ask you for a loan? +++$+++ 1990s
Because I felt like it.  What do you care? +++$+++ 1990s
Even better. +++$+++ 1990s
Shocking, huh? We're clear now. It's done. I've never actually paid for a car. I want to see what it feels like +++$+++ 2000s
All over?  I kept trying to cover a very modest portion and still failed.  Are you leaving us?  Now's our opportunity to swap war wounds. +++$+++ 1990s
And Johnnie is his son, that's Johnnie Marzzone? +++$+++ 1990s
There's a rumor you've been going around miscalibrating the machines.  I don't think that's a good idea. +++$+++ 1990s
My mother. +++$+++ 1990s
Dorothy, let me tell you something, we are back. We are so very very back.  I re-signed Cush. We're set. +++$+++ 1990s
I don't want to have anyone live through that night again. +++$+++ 1980s
Who would know where they were hidden? +++$+++ 1980s
William Clay.  Call me Bill. +++$+++ 1980s
cross it...  The static overwhelms the voice, then cuts out. +++$+++ 1990s
I didn't make him for you +++$+++ 1970s
It's for my brudder.  Alvy Singer! Hey! This is Alvy- +++$+++ 1970s
What'd they call her in college? +++$+++ 2000s
Him, he costs you a fortune in breach of promise cases. He's a villain and a right mixer as well. +++$+++ 1960s
Baudmore Consultants. +++$+++ 1990s
We ought to start camping again, Dad. +++$+++ 1990s
Mr. Chekov, slow down. Take us forward, thrusters only, one quarter impulse power. +++$+++ 1990s
Yes. I can see: You've hung the rest of your relatives. +++$+++ 1990s
Good.  Total exhaustion can be spiritually fabulous.  Let's play catch. +++$+++ 1980s
INT. VITELLI'S HELICOPTER - DAY. +++$+++ 1990s
You mean,  me? +++$+++ 2000s
Not yet. +++$+++ 1980s
What is it you got between you? +++$+++ 1990s
Hey, Nick? +++$+++ 1970s
Mmm. +++$+++ 1980s
Yes. +++$+++ 1990s
There was Rose Cheramie.  A whore. Two Cubans threw her out of a car on the way to Dallas. +++$+++ 1990s
Well, would you like to know who it was you were marrying? +++$+++ 1940s
A man, miss -- an old man who lives in the garden at Fort Holland - with arrows stuck in him and a sorrowful, weeping look on his black face. +++$+++ 1940s
You gonna put it away? +++$+++ 1990s
I hope you won't talk that way to the police when they come here. +++$+++ 1930s
No, I mean... +++$+++ 1990s
Cut out that us business. +++$+++ 1950s
I had no idea... +++$+++ 1970s
Is that all that interests you? Gold? +++$+++ 1990s
I love Linda. Myself, I love Linda so much! +++$+++ 1970s
A few hitches sir, but I'm confident we'll have a prototype in no time. +++$+++ 1990s
Oh God, it's over now! +++$+++ 1980s
When do we bring'em back? +++$+++ 1990s
Oh yeah? And who's gonna come to save you, Junior?? +++$+++ 1980s
Yaay! +++$+++ 1980s
Where am I going to work? +++$+++ 1990s
Don't be ridiculous, these are my babies. +++$+++ 2000s
Yeah. hurry up though. +++$+++ 1990s
Blow me.  Yellow means go, Kimberly. +++$+++ 2000s
Isn't it true you have spent your life pretending to be something you're not, so much so that the art of concealment and dishonesty has become second nature to you?! +++$+++ 1990s
Someday, I'll find out. +++$+++ 2000s
See, I don't know how it happened... she's a smart girl and you are an extraordinary screwed-up guy... but she's in love with you. +++$+++ 1980s
You sure did. +++$+++ 1980s
You aren't? +++$+++ 1990s
Yes.  John made quite a study of the whole museum.  He had a copy of my original plans. +++$+++ 1990s
I want to know. We haven't talked this way in years. +++$+++ 2000s
Just gettin' rid of the garbage. +++$+++ 1990s
Shakespeare.  He's European. +++$+++ 2000s
No. But I can bypass it with one of these +++$+++ 1980s
Did you kill my father?! +++$+++ 1990s
If the stores are open - +++$+++ 1950s
I'll be back. +++$+++ 1980s
Is it all right if I go to the bathroom? +++$+++ 1970s
Ah Stephen, that's what this is really about, isn't it? You always have to be right. +++$+++ 1990s
I know that.  I'm warped... I'm warped! +++$+++ 1970s
Well, it ain't exactly a bed of roses down here. We gonna run or not? +++$+++ 1980s
Oh, but it is.  He's killing a person everyday and challenging us to catch him.  That's a game.  It has rules and objectives. +++$+++ 1990s
Yes.  I think you probably can.  We'd need to talk about your fee. +++$+++ 1990s
I don't care what people say. +++$+++ 1970s
Your decision. For us. +++$+++ 1930s
You don't really get it.  He's not a nightstalker.  It'll take more than bench presses to beat him. +++$+++ 1980s
Surely. +++$+++ 1980s
You want some advice? Don't do this again.  You know exactly what I mean. +++$+++ 1990s
That's right - came down in kinda spurts, didn't it?  You fellers'll have to figure it out.  You're scientists  All I know - they say it's as big as a house and practically red hot. +++$+++ 1950s
Crossin' the desert in a jalopy like this. +++$+++ 1940s
Hey, I'm eating. +++$+++ 1990s
Will you bring up my purse before you go? +++$+++ 1960s
I don't want you for my father! +++$+++ 1950s
You seen Mac? His bed hasn't been slept in. +++$+++ 2000s
Strip down a nun?  You want us to fry? +++$+++ 1990s
It's some psycho killer groupie. I got an anonymous letter that says she killed Bobby Vomit, Johnny Crunch, and now, this society dame. +++$+++ 1990s
Do you have the suspect in custody? +++$+++ 2000s
Take it easy, take it easy, it was an accident. +++$+++ 1970s
He's not really my uncle. +++$+++ 1990s
Oh, she's got a cold. She's in bed. Caught it coming home from school. They gave her a flower for a prize and she didn't want to crush it so she didn't button up her coat. +++$+++ 1940s
... If it happens, it happens. If it doesn't, it doesn't. Do you understand what I'm saying? You never know what's going to happen next, and the moment you think you know, that's the moment you don't know a goddamn thing. That's what we call a paradox. Are you following me? +++$+++ 1990s
Sometimes. +++$+++ 1990s
Nino, please... +++$+++ 1990s
Oh no.  Not by a long shot.  I may look like the old Daniel O'Brien, but on the inside, nothing is the same. +++$+++ 1990s
Good morning, Comrade Commissar. Here is my report on the materials available for trading in the next four months. +++$+++ 1930s
Go down there and kill everybody, I guess. +++$+++ 1990s
So, wait, you're from where? +++$+++ 2000s
Ow, shit... +++$+++ 2000s
Better watch out for that kind, Zackie. You know what they call 'em, don't ya? +++$+++ 1980s
Won't do, love.  It's not spring.  It's nearly autumn..You're in Oz.  everything's upside down and backwards here. +++$+++ 2000s
I am always glad to see you Paul. +++$+++ 2000s
We're no getting anywhere. All right, look, Tommy. The bogyman can only come out on Halloween night, right? +++$+++ 1970s
No...his business is bad.  But I'll decide what to do and you...and you just keep out of anything that might...might...er draw attention to you. +++$+++ 1980s
At Miracle Max's. It fit so nice, he said I could keep it. +++$+++ 1980s
I sure didn't expect her to drop dead. +++$+++ 1970s
I will do it. +++$+++ 1990s
He didn't even pull his pistol, huh? +++$+++ 1990s
I shot her. +++$+++ 1990s
I can hear her. Oh Mother of God, I can hear her. +++$+++ 1990s
Evan, I am so sorry, you were a saint to wait for us! +++$+++ 2000s
I don't know, Christine. Perhaps it's because I feel attacked. +++$+++ 2000s
That's because you' re not a total moron like they are. +++$+++ 1980s
Well, what's the point of waiting? +++$+++ 1990s
Must have been some time ago. Maybe forty years? +++$+++ 2000s
Oh yeah! Better be good and hurry away then! Who knows? We might be being watched! Maybe one of your stupid French companies has got a detective prying into your life - after all, that’s what they do to their employees, isn’t it? Huh! Hope you enjoy ruining people’s lives. Thanks for the lift! +++$+++ 1990s
But I have never seen this before. I am not complete. +++$+++ 1980s
Here I'll show you. +++$+++ 1970s
Yah, so we're all set. +++$+++ 1990s
I swear it will be done. +++$+++ 1980s
Now hold on, boys, hold on. Now, Kid, you kin see fifty yards, can't you? +++$+++ 1990s
The other side. +++$+++ 2000s
No. +++$+++ 1990s
But you think he fools around. +++$+++ 1990s
Okay, listen, just get the custom's office to send me a copy as fast as possible.  We can't send you new equipment until our file is complete.  Okay? +++$+++ 1980s
An Oldsmobile Silhouette. +++$+++ 1990s
You'll take care of it. Boy, you are smooth smooth, you know. +++$+++ 1990s
I have to tell you.  It's strange. +++$+++ 1990s
Lonesome? +++$+++ 1930s
Fifteen miles. I'll get your bags. +++$+++ 1960s
Flame on, flame off.  Flame on, flame off -- +++$+++ 1990s
I can't tell you that. +++$+++ 1980s
Two hours a day, six days a week. +++$+++ 1980s
Sometimes what a child says or fantasizes will give a clue to what ails him.  Did he say anything while he was still lucid? +++$+++ 1990s
--By itself it is only a piece of steel. Its power comes from he who wields it. For now there is no one. Do as I have ordered! +++$+++ 1980s
Johnny!  Uh, you, uh... should call first, you know?  Hey, where the hell were you all day?  You gotta at least call in or something.  You okay? +++$+++ 1990s
Hey. +++$+++ 1990s
Describe exactly what you think he did to Mrs. Leeds and I'll tell you if you're right or not. +++$+++ 1980s
Drew! +++$+++ 1990s
Maggie Muldovan? Did you...know her? +++$+++ 1990s
You poor, poor boy. +++$+++ 1950s
I bet.  What about me? Am I how you imagined? +++$+++ 2000s
My daughters -- yes, my daughters. +++$+++ 1930s
The Penny Saver sucks. +++$+++ 2000s
I was born, in New Orleans, too- +++$+++ 1990s
Well which of those three ya want fixed? +++$+++ 2000s
Steve -- +++$+++ 1940s
I think while we're waiting, we had better run some basic diagnostics on you. +++$+++ 1990s
Who's driving her? +++$+++ 2000s
I was playing naked. +++$+++ 1980s
Morpheus, what's happened to me? What is this place? +++$+++ 1990s
Take a bow, Steven, you've outdone yourself tonight -- scared holy hell out of even me. +++$+++ 1990s
I'll be right back. +++$+++ 2000s
Same with me, pretending I was you. An impulse.  Why not?  I had this shoe. +++$+++ 1990s
I think Tex did it. +++$+++ 1960s
Send in the next girl. +++$+++ 1930s
I once read somewhere that one quarter of all the people in the United States have at least one relative who has lived in Brooklyn at one time or another. +++$+++ 1990s
Oh my God. +++$+++ 1990s
It isn't enough that the monster killed all those people- that he killed Brady. Now he's got them to cancel the fair. +++$+++ 1980s
Because you lost my fucking carpet cleaning van and I don't like you. +++$+++ 2000s
Ah ha.  What did he want? +++$+++ 1990s
Oh, okay. +++$+++ 2000s
...They never caught that Black Dolya Killer, huh? +++$+++ 1990s
I don't know how. +++$+++ 1990s
What, "is"? +++$+++ 1970s
My wife used to call me Lenny. +++$+++ 2000s
What is this person's story here? +++$+++ 1980s
But it's a small room, Jason. +++$+++ 1940s
Well. I'm sorry, sir, but we've got to ask you for it. +++$+++ 1970s
You know Wilmont? +++$+++ 2000s
JAG gets here in three hours. Try for the confession. +++$+++ 2000s
You hear what I said? +++$+++ 1990s
Course, if Carl lost both batteries, dead in the water, his radio wouldn't work.  So how would he signal for help? +++$+++ 1990s
I do. I remember from day one. People staring at me, sensing I was different. Watching the fear grow in their eyes, knowing in their hearts I wasn't human. +++$+++ 1990s
Don't. +++$+++ 2000s
I told Zack about Saturday night, too. The fifth week's supposed to be the roughest. Come Wednesday, he'll be wishing he took my number. +++$+++ 1980s
Three nights, two days. When is your rent coming up at the motel? +++$+++ 1990s
That's not him... Jesus, stop freaking me out. +++$+++ 2000s
We could come to my room. +++$+++ 1930s
Right here someplace. +++$+++ 1990s
He's a doctor, Buster--doctors smell like ether. +++$+++ 1990s
I'm not crying. I'm allergic to fine home furnishings. See you later. +++$+++ 2000s
You're aware, are you not, that it costs a great deal to house your husband at Charenton... +++$+++ 2000s
Yes, your name? +++$+++ 2000s
That's what Winston does. He finds people who don't want to be found. +++$+++ 1990s
Tell me your name. +++$+++ 1980s
Hi, Baxter. +++$+++ 1960s
I don't want to...I have scary dreams. +++$+++ 1980s
You seem fine now. +++$+++ 1990s
What surery? +++$+++ 1990s
Oh, you know, the usual.  Bowl. Drive around.  The occasional acid flashback. +++$+++ 1990s
Let's go --  We got to get away from this phone. +++$+++ 2000s
Two. +++$+++ 2000s
I know it, I know it. +++$+++ 1970s
The Marquis de Sade and Origins of Sadism. +++$+++ 1970s
Creasy. Pinta likes him. +++$+++ 2000s
Give me a tremendous laugh here, Charlie. +++$+++ 1970s
I'll miss you so much. +++$+++ 1990s
Yes, sir. There are two in the Veridian system. +++$+++ 1990s
Where were you trained? +++$+++ 1940s
This is monstrous.  I'll burn in hell for all eternity. +++$+++ 1980s
What? +++$+++ 1930s
"I found a million dollar baby—" +++$+++ 1930s
So? What do they think -- we're not kids -- +++$+++ 1990s
About the plane? What do you think it’s gonna crash? Don’t say that... +++$+++ 2000s
We were probably in school together.  You went to Berkley? +++$+++ 2000s
He's gonna lose a finger eating eggs like that. +++$+++ 1960s
Did she always have nightmares? +++$+++ 1980s
Did he put you up to it? Did he ask you to sleep with me? +++$+++ 1980s
I used to come to this tree when I was a kid and imagine what my life would be like when I got older. +++$+++ 2000s
You never came back from the war. We were told you were missing and presumed dead. +++$+++ 2000s
You know, I never told anybody this, but I always had a feeling that when you die, before you go to heaven, you get a chance to fly around high school for a while. +++$+++ 1980s
Snow creatures ... they're here?! +++$+++ 1980s
'They won't.' +++$+++ 2000s
Right.  Auto-shop, you all set? +++$+++ 1990s
Yes, but, sir... if it could be accomplished, wouldn't that eliminate disease from the human frame and render man invulnerable to any but a violent death? +++$+++ 1970s
Janine, I'm sure a woman with your qualifications would have no trouble finding a top flight job in the housekeeping or food service industry. +++$+++ 1980s
Not just Kyle.  All of you.  His entire family.  Here.  Look at this. +++$+++ 1990s
You could have a pool to cool off in. +++$+++ 1980s
Right, seriously. +++$+++ 2000s
Nah, that's just Tony's way of telling me Judge Judy starts in ten minutes. You ever watch it? +++$+++ 2000s
There's a bathroom upstairs. +++$+++ 1990s
Oona tells me the raven has roosted for the night on a sharp stone spire some half a mile distance. +++$+++ 1980s
Maybe I oughta talk to this Ray Bones character myself. See if he wants to invest in my movie. +++$+++ 1990s
The mother said the boy hadn't slept for over three _months_. A physical examination showed dilated pupils, temperature of one-oh-two, blood chemistry highly imbalanced... +++$+++ 2000s
Umm. Well. Yes. But no more strange voices in the night, Rose. +++$+++ 1990s
Sir? +++$+++ 1970s
First light, we'll take a chopper out there and tell them to head back. +++$+++ 1990s
If we're on an island, why are they using trucks? +++$+++ 1990s
You're the Dread Pirate Roberts; admit it. +++$+++ 1980s
It's not regulation.  And the only way you're gonna stop anybody with it is to show it to him, and while he's laughing, you can shove it down his throat. +++$+++ 1980s
What do you mean by that? +++$+++ 2000s
No son, thisahere moonshine's got nothin' to do with shuttin' folks out. No, I'm usin' it to build somethin'. +++$+++ 1990s
In the helicopter. +++$+++ 1990s
Home. +++$+++ 1980s
That's right. +++$+++ 1990s
You can't be more specific than that? +++$+++ 1990s
HA! +++$+++ 2000s
It's a fucking nightmare, isn't it? +++$+++ 1990s
You're thinking of Mr. Wizard.  This guy's an eccentric genius. +++$+++ 1980s
Don't drop it Rose. +++$+++ 1990s
What? +++$+++ 2000s
Are you a married man, Mr. Deeds? +++$+++ 1930s
How'd you get the picture? +++$+++ 1990s
I can never keep them all straight - was she the super-bitch? +++$+++ 2000s
Should we knock? +++$+++ 2000s
Delmar? I never go out to California. That's a thousand miles from here. +++$+++ 1990s
You can't help them.  Right now they're being cocooned just like the others. +++$+++ 1980s
So...? +++$+++ 2000s
How old are you now, Toby? +++$+++ 2000s
So, Juno. First off, how far along are you? +++$+++ 2000s
Oh. Yeah. +++$+++ 2000s
ain't got a hat— +++$+++ 1930s
Come on, Ed. +++$+++ 1980s
A simple, unstoppable lifeform. What is a virus but a colonizing force that cannot be defeated? Living in a cave, underground, until it mutates. And attacks. +++$+++ 1990s
Bye. +++$+++ 1990s
Maybe I can do something right. +++$+++ 1980s
That's okay. That's his style. +++$+++ 1990s
Something I ate. +++$+++ 1980s
Still trying to figure it out myself. +++$+++ 2000s
Don't blame her, Rafe.  It's not like you're thinking. +++$+++ 2000s
Good point. +++$+++ 2000s
What's the matter, Matt? Gee, I thought you'd be thrilled to death. +++$+++ 1930s
What!?  What are you talking about?  Why should I help you? +++$+++ 1990s
We went out for about five minutes... which is four minutes longer than most of them.  But you can't hold it against him, he's... different. +++$+++ 1990s
You didn't like him? +++$+++ 1980s
And then... +++$+++ 1990s
How much? +++$+++ 1990s
Once you're in it, it warms up. +++$+++ 1990s
Potential? I don't understand. +++$+++ 2000s
To get my guns. +++$+++ 1980s
I'm not ready. +++$+++ 2000s
Lydia's trying, but they don't believe her. +++$+++ 1980s
Jack!  The courtyard's been taken... The Baron's forces are besieged in the south tower.  No sign of... Jack?  Do you hear what I'm saying? We've won, lad. +++$+++ 1980s
Offworld. The A.I.... this "Wintermute" thing evolved on a computer mainframe on the satellite Freeside. If you attack it from within the matrix while Molly accesses its original programming we can cripple its defence systems. +++$+++ 1980s
On the counter. +++$+++ 1990s
Holy mother, what is that? +++$+++ 1990s
...since I used to take you to the Proms? +++$+++ 1980s
I’m moving to Paris...it was right here...  It’s a box marked “Jack.”  I put it in the stack for the Salvation Army... +++$+++ 2000s
No? Then what? +++$+++ 1950s
No. +++$+++ 1970s
I'm sorry for losing it back there, but you must remember, sister, you have vows to God as well as a mission to the world. +++$+++ 1990s
Yes you are. +++$+++ 2000s
Mama? +++$+++ 1990s
Trust me. We're safe. +++$+++ 2000s
Oh boy, say, you think you're pretty good. +++$+++ 1970s
Morning... Say, you got any gas? +++$+++ 1970s
All you gotta do is place a bet for me at Shaw's place.  I'll supply all the money and the information. +++$+++ 1970s
Only in the emergency room or when he was well. +++$+++ 1990s
Sincere.  What are you talking about, of course I'm sincere with you, Mike. +++$+++ 1970s
It happened to you before? +++$+++ 1990s
There are plenty of other safe places. Why don't we go back to my flat? +++$+++ 1980s
But-- +++$+++ 1990s
You must believe me. +++$+++ 1980s
That's nothing compared to how my cousin Walter died. +++$+++ 1990s
One night. +++$+++ 1960s
How was your date? +++$+++ 1980s
He's right behind us! +++$+++ 2000s
I call it my shower dream. +++$+++ 2000s
Because it exists. +++$+++ 1990s
Listen, did anybody ever make a sucker out of you? This is a matter of principle. Something you probably wouldn't understand.  When somebody takes me for a buggy ride I don't like the idea of having to pay for the privilege. +++$+++ 1930s
Louise?... The maid?...  But she should have left earlier today... +++$+++ 1970s
Now Gallagher, if we could only get a great scene - a tremendously emotional scene - something that would just wring the hearts out of the public - to bring the curtain down in the second act - that would be okay. Couldn't dig one out of your hat some place, could you? +++$+++ 1930s
Now see here young man. +++$+++ 1980s
We don't have that kinda time, boss, I don't think Prague's gonna be around much longer. I've gotta go now. I've got a lot of bad guys to kill. +++$+++ 2000s
Me? Look at you! What're you doing in Hollywood? +++$+++ 1980s
YOU LOST YOUR BABY WHEN YOU LOST YOUR BALLS YOU'VE LOST YOUR MIND, YOU'VE LOST YOUR GRIP SO SAY BYE-BYE +++$+++ 1980s
My name is... +++$+++ 1990s
How do I know? +++$+++ 1990s
Their life expectancy is a hundred and thirty. +++$+++ 2000s
This is the ultimate. It's like the Taj Mahal of bad, fake 50's diners. +++$+++ 2000s
You expect me to believe that? +++$+++ 1980s
I don't think I belong here. +++$+++ 1970s
Sure, just watch where you're going. +++$+++ 1980s
They ought to be under the barbed wire soon. +++$+++ 1950s
Oh, Peter. A zit. +++$+++ 2000s
Mason, you have to take this... +++$+++ 1990s
Make someone happy-have you ever wanted to? +++$+++ 2000s
Don't worry about me.  Where are we going? +++$+++ 1990s
Is Noel in? +++$+++ 2000s
My mother said he never asked about-- +++$+++ 1990s
Hello. +++$+++ 1990s
If you want to. +++$+++ 1980s
It's in front of us. +++$+++ 1980s
Good evening Mr. Crabbin. +++$+++ 1940s
So why are they after you? +++$+++ 1990s
Have him meet me with pictures of Lecktor's books... +++$+++ 1980s
Lemme see if I got this right, you break into Karen Flores' house, ask me for three hundred grand, doesn't even belong to you? +++$+++ 1990s
No, you...didn't? +++$+++ 2000s
You know how you feel when you come out of a bad hangover? Like your eyes can open a little bit more. +++$+++ 2000s
But you looked as if you liked it. +++$+++ 1990s
Of course not. He wouldn't be. +++$+++ 1940s
Your dad has two computer disks.  They have funny names:  Marlon and Al. +++$+++ 2000s
No!... Yes, a little. You see Hollis and my fa... my father had a falling out... +++$+++ 1970s
I won't. You would misuse such power. I have paid enough for you, and I will have you. +++$+++ 1980s
Lotta rich women back there... +++$+++ 1960s
No, not yet. +++$+++ 1940s
Yeah.  You know Harry. +++$+++ 1990s
See my nipples? +++$+++ 1980s
That son of a bitch, everything he says is a phony piece of shit, what does he think, I'm some cigar butt he's got between his teeth -- +++$+++ 1970s
All right, Captain Oveur.  Over. +++$+++ 1980s
Debbie, men are pigs -- if they can have women, we can have men. +++$+++ 1980s
<u>Now</u>. +++$+++ 1990s
I'm not going to jump on you! +++$+++ 1960s
That's motherhood.  That's the job, with or without a career. I'm telling you the biggest gift you can give them is your happiness. They <u>need</u> you to be happy. +++$+++ 1990s
You know less than nothing.  If you even knew that you knew nothing, at least that would be something, but you don't. +++$+++ 1990s
Dear God. +++$+++ 1980s
How often does one of our clerks have business in the house of records? +++$+++ 1990s
But, hell, this is nothing compared to Venezuela.  When I was Vice President, Ike sent me down there like a blocking back.  They threw rocks, broke out our windows, almost overturned the car. Read Six Crises, Bob.  Boy, Pat was brave! +++$+++ 1990s
Shove the gentleman jockey in the make-up room or something and keep your eye on him, will you? +++$+++ 1960s
And tonight? +++$+++ 2000s
Not really - +++$+++ 2000s
I figure we'll get along just fine. +++$+++ 1940s
Defined by Webster's as harmless. +++$+++ 1990s
How long ago? +++$+++ 1940s
Okay.  Okay. +++$+++ 2000s
No matter what happens...I'm glad I met you. +++$+++ 2000s
You've seen her!...She's alive? +++$+++ 1950s
Exactly why it should be given away. +++$+++ 1990s
...  thank you. +++$+++ 1990s
And? +++$+++ 1990s
That's perfectly all right. +++$+++ 1980s
I like it. +++$+++ 2000s
But don't you see...the brain of Hans Delbruck is inside this grotesque hulk -- pleading with us.  I've got to untie it. +++$+++ 1970s
It appears that someone has taken over the Environmental Control Room. +++$+++ 1990s
Here's the data on the Clyde deal. +++$+++ 1930s
Hollywood. +++$+++ 1950s
Slower! Nobody can row at that speed! +++$+++ 1980s
Not much more.  Big day in the big city.  What's on your mind? +++$+++ 1990s
Yes I can... Oh look, let me do that for you, shall I? +++$+++ 1970s
Me neither...But this buck claimed he was a big war chief with the Nawyecky Comanches. +++$+++ 1950s
There's no way to practice this. And no time. Besides, I've planned it all. There aren't any surprises. +++$+++ 1990s
It's a family heirloom. +++$+++ 2000s
You've got to decide that for yourself. +++$+++ 1990s
That's right. +++$+++ 2000s
Been drinkin' today? +++$+++ 1990s
Yes, William, Uh, we have this <u>thing</u> we're doing... +++$+++ 1990s
In fifteen minutes I can teach you everything you need to know to dine with the Queen.  First, as you pick up the knife you shift your fork to the left hand. +++$+++ 1990s
I had a lot to do with that little press conference last night-- +++$+++ 1930s
You sure? I can always get you a lime. +++$+++ 2000s
That's two more than the Fantastic Four. +++$+++ 1990s
Murray. +++$+++ 1970s
Mr. Deeds, are you the son of Dr. Joseph and Mary Deeds? +++$+++ 1930s
Mrs. Haydn... +++$+++ 1980s
Yes, I did. +++$+++ 1990s
I finished the boats. +++$+++ 2000s
I got some more business for ya. +++$+++ 1990s
So do half the other people in this place. How do I know which one? +++$+++ 2000s
Anytime. +++$+++ 1990s
She left. +++$+++ 1990s
"I would bet on it." +++$+++ 1990s
You won't look pushy. +++$+++ 1980s
I think we have to work on narrowing down our list of suspects. Now I'm going to go check in with some of my contacts uptown. +++$+++ 2000s
No, I... I never killed anyone! +++$+++ 2000s
What... +++$+++ 1990s
Story of my life.  Well, one thing you won't lose is that friend of yours back there, I'll tell you that. +++$+++ 1990s
No. +++$+++ 1990s
Jesus Christ, Stanley, you can't go to the bathroom now.  You have exactly one minute before we're back on the air, this is NOT the time to go to the bathroom. +++$+++ 1990s
Is mom ever coming back? +++$+++ 1970s
Meyer, ain't anybody ever told you ya look more like a bookkeeper than a fuckin' mobster? +++$+++ 1990s
No!  Don't kill him! +++$+++ 1990s
So what do you want? +++$+++ 2000s
Mr. Dumbarton is, yes. +++$+++ 2000s
I see.  Well, I guess we don't have much to say to each other. +++$+++ 1960s
If you think I am behind this, say it. +++$+++ 1990s
Goodnight Shelly. +++$+++ 1990s
Who else phoned? +++$+++ 1950s
Somethin' knocked us off-lane. Maybe a rogue comet. Maybe we'll never know. +++$+++ 2000s
I know you believe that. +++$+++ 1980s
Easy, tiger.  What's in there? +++$+++ 1990s
I made a couple of lunches for you and put them in brown paper bags ...  I'm gonna go now. +++$+++ 1990s
You are late. I've been waiting for you -- waiting. +++$+++ 1930s
I felt you...looking through me... +++$+++ 2000s
Do you work? +++$+++ 2000s
They burn many villages. Even walled cities fall to them. +++$+++ 1980s
We tried to be.  We tried to be. +++$+++ 1970s
No. But he hands them over. +++$+++ 1990s
No, I tell you! Nobody knows where he got it. +++$+++ 1940s
Sleep 'N Eat, I was my wife's husband and grandchild at one and the same time.  And lo' and behold, as the husband of a person's grandmother is his grandfather, I Mantan, became my own grandfather. +++$+++ 2000s
You always get what you want? +++$+++ 1980s
Too far inland. +++$+++ 1970s
C'mon! +++$+++ 1990s
Joe Saracini. He was a mason that did some repairs on the brickwork at the rear of the house. That was in 1952. +++$+++ 1970s
Ok.  So, lemme just ask you a couple questions to start -- +++$+++ 1990s
Mom and Dad said it's yours. They seem to think you're coming home. +++$+++ 2000s
He was talkin' about arrangements ... we were talkin' about the TV. +++$+++ 1970s
Walter can I ask you something? +++$+++ 1950s
But it can't wait. +++$+++ 1980s
Sucks for you. +++$+++ 2000s
No.... +++$+++ 1980s
I'm sorry, too.  Wow.  That only took us between years to say. +++$+++ 1990s
Lemme see that. +++$+++ 1980s
Well it's pretty obvious you don't want me around any more. +++$+++ 1960s
Captain Dwyer.  Technically. +++$+++ 1990s
I thought you were a man of God. +++$+++ 1980s
That's what you think, is it, Jim? +++$+++ 1940s
That's true Doug, writers are supposed to write. +++$+++ 2000s
What happened? +++$+++ 1950s
If they do see thee, they will murder thee. +++$+++ 1960s
How many was that? +++$+++ 1990s
That's your problems The more women think, the more trouble they get into. +++$+++ 1980s
Look...  Do you wanna fuck me? +++$+++ 1970s
Didn't you have something to do with this?  I know you sent word to the Sixth Army Command! +++$+++ 1950s
What if I say I'll go out with you, so you can have all these great daydreams, but then never actually talk to you again? +++$+++ 2000s
You're supposed to make time. When was the last time you told her you love her?  When was the last time you two had sex? +++$+++ 1990s
You're too modest. +++$+++ 1970s
Why not just shoot Kennedy coming up Houston?  There's plenty of time - he's out in the open - a frontal shot? +++$+++ 1990s
I'm calling the cops. This is for the cops. +++$+++ 1980s
What? Oh, it's very impressive. +++$+++ 1990s
Ah, a philosopher. +++$+++ 2000s
Little Bill, I thought you were dead. I see you shaved off your chin whiskers. +++$+++ 1990s
Erin knows, doesn't she? +++$+++ 2000s
It would never have worked, Luthor. You are a dreamer  --  a sick, twisted dreamer. +++$+++ 1970s
Ow! +++$+++ 1990s
No, it's true.  Last night when you were sleeping, I had you all to myself. +++$+++ 1960s
What are you talking about? +++$+++ 1980s
Yes ... +++$+++ 1990s
But Ian, he's still but a boy. +++$+++ 1980s
Shouldn't we get a catheter in him? +++$+++ 2000s
I've been on another case. All day.  I suppose I can move it over. Seven fifty a week, plus travel expenses. +++$+++ 1970s
They had to, in order to survive. +++$+++ 1980s
Mine's Edward. And truthfully, I do want you to leave, Karl. But I want to leave with you.  You think this town is too small for you, well, it's too small for a man of my ambition. I can't see staying here a day longer. +++$+++ 2000s
Um...I'm pretty sure I'm Bruce Wayne. And you are? +++$+++ 1990s
What's with you? +++$+++ 1990s
Rac. R-A-C. Renovate, Automate, Computerize. That, my boy, is the future. One of the monitors shows a little girl bowling. Her ball moves so slowly it barely tips over the first pin. Kastle hits a key and the pins explode in an emphatic strike. The little girl jumps with joy. +++$+++ 1990s
At one time I could have chosen not to be. +++$+++ 2000s
No, I guess not. +++$+++ 1990s
Stop right there. +++$+++ 2000s
Well, fi' cents a box ain't much, but a fella can eat. +++$+++ 1940s
I heard about today.  Good job.  I'm all for capital punishment.  Why don't you go home and see your family? +++$+++ 1990s
Yeah, Billy, who's your buyer?... No, not interested.  Ollie, start calling a the institutions, start with Marx at Janson Mutual, then Reardon. Get me that California retirement money, baby! And we're on our way! +++$+++ 1980s
If that's the way you want to play it. +++$+++ 1990s
Want one? +++$+++ 2000s
Ya puttin' me on? +++$+++ 1970s
This is stupid.  It'd be just too easy. +++$+++ 1970s
Farewell, Concorde! +++$+++ 1970s
What? +++$+++ 1990s
You what? +++$+++ 1950s
Well, I'm home now, so you can go right to sleep.  C'mon, angel. +++$+++ 1980s
Good title. +++$+++ 1990s
Maybe you should drive him into Devil's Cauldron, let them decide what to do with him. +++$+++ 1990s
This here's a lawful contract... betwixt me an' Delilah Fitzgerald, the cut-whore. Now I brung her clear from Boston, paid her expenses an' all, an' I got a contract which represents an investment of capital. +++$+++ 1990s
All right, furry muff. +++$+++ 1990s
I should release Corbett because you want some votes? +++$+++ 1990s
No.  At the end... when we had him cornered, he got into my head. He showed me what we really look like, when the veneer's gone.  Jelly. Shit... +++$+++ 1990s
I see. +++$+++ 1980s
I can do that, too. +++$+++ 1980s
He's really cute! +++$+++ 1990s
In the last six weeks you've only been in my elevator once -- and then you didn't take your hat off. +++$+++ 1960s
Nice, baby. +++$+++ 1990s
... what? +++$+++ 2000s
You have faith, Professor Barnhardt +++$+++ 2000s
What I <u>should</u> have done a long time ago.  Applications and patents, Reed. This all belongs to me. +++$+++ 1990s
I never heard that. +++$+++ 1980s
Eighth room down, babe... +++$+++ 1990s
I knew it. 'Cause we wouldn't have heard anything if it was him. He's real careful. Fact is, he's anal. +++$+++ 1980s
Don't touch my mother... +++$+++ 1980s
Sol' things, chopped cotton--even Grampa. Got us about two hunnerd dollars all tol'. Shucked out seventy- five for this truck, but we still got nearly a hunnerd and fifty to set out on. I figger we oughta be able to make it on that. +++$+++ 1940s
Lauren, right? +++$+++ 1990s
Jesus. +++$+++ 1990s
The serial killer? +++$+++ 1990s
Give him some good exercise?  Sure Some stud.  Some string in fact. What're you gonna do, race 'em? +++$+++ 1990s
No. Not everything. +++$+++ 1990s
April 16...?  That means she was the first. +++$+++ 2000s
You got Pug killed! You tried to get ME killed! You just lost your Get- Outta-Jail-Free -- +++$+++ 2000s
So why don't you take a deep breath, Jake, and I'll count to ten. One. Two. Three... +++$+++ 2000s
I'm sorry.  It's just you're a really nice guy, and we don't want to see you get hurt. +++$+++ 1980s
See, we're very busy. A TV network that wishes to remain nameless has expressed an interest in our show. +++$+++ 1990s
But listen, Glenn.  If you're lying to me... +++$+++ 1990s
Just leave'em. There's plenty of other girls. +++$+++ 1970s
I had no idea you were even here. +++$+++ 1950s
Well, a course they're gonna say that! But where's my protection? They got Jean here! I give these sons a bitches a million dollars, where's my guarantee they're gonna let her go. +++$+++ 1990s
I can't believe I'm hearing this, +++$+++ 2000s
Max. +++$+++ 1990s
They are old, we are young, they are fast, we are fun. +++$+++ 1990s
Even if I'm near a fire, I'm cold. I guess just about everybody's cold. +++$+++ 1950s
Still in a bad mood?  At least you're speaking.  What's your name? +++$+++ 2000s
I don't care what you say about him. The boy has got it bad. +++$+++ 1990s
Be careful. +++$+++ 1990s
What do you want? +++$+++ 1990s
I fell in love. After that, I never thought about being anything but a rancher's wife. I never saw it like I was losing some other life, just felt like I was gaining one. I know that's not a popular opinion nowadays and I ain't saying it's the right one. We all have to find the life meant for us. +++$+++ 1990s
One thing that's hard to understand is how you could have this incredible background in music, and then just walk away from it, without a second thought... +++$+++ 1970s
Sanford's brother dates her cousin. He found out this morning. +++$+++ 1990s
Unless it's illegal in the UK to serve liquids below room temperature: I don't want you going to jail just to satisfy my whims... +++$+++ 1990s
It's locked? +++$+++ 1990s
Then I know my alphabet. +++$+++ 1940s
I like that. +++$+++ 2000s
Science thinks there isn't. That we are all alone in the universe. +++$+++ 1970s
Well, then, I'm afraid I'm gonna have to keep it. +++$+++ 1990s
Didn't you feel the house rock? You must have seen all those shell bursts. +++$+++ 1980s
What, come on? +++$+++ 1990s
You, me and White, huh? +++$+++ 1990s
I have no idea. +++$+++ 1980s
All right-so we can afford it. +++$+++ 1970s
And is that it? +++$+++ 1990s
Report. +++$+++ 1990s
Objection.  The question calls for a conclusion on the part of the witness. +++$+++ 1990s
I still don't know what that means. +++$+++ 2000s
Yah? +++$+++ 1990s
Caspiar?  I haven't heard of that. +++$+++ 1990s
Well I like your style too, man. Got a whole cowboy thing goin'. +++$+++ 1990s
No, I... I think we should talk about this. +++$+++ 1990s
And you said yes? +++$+++ 1990s
King—King Westley was in it. +++$+++ 1930s
Okay boys, smile! +++$+++ 1990s
You'd be surprised. Most guys have kids or wives or girlfriends. They're busy. It's not as easy as you think. +++$+++ 1990s
If you say so. +++$+++ 1980s
Not usually this drunk. +++$+++ 1990s
But how'll I put on the slipper, sir? +++$+++ 1930s
Good. +++$+++ 1970s
Because we're running a newspaper, Mr. Kane, not a scandal sheet. +++$+++ 1940s
I didn't mean it. +++$+++ 2000s
Benjamin -- do they know you? +++$+++ 1960s
I can't hardly understand you when you talk with one of them Mores in your mouth. +++$+++ 1990s
She wants to see what you can do. +++$+++ 1990s
Where? +++$+++ 1990s
I got a bad feeling about this.... How much do you need? +++$+++ 2000s
Are you a believer, then? +++$+++ 1990s
They're dying. +++$+++ 1990s
It's his show for now.  Look, you want to get some dinner?  Inter- Agency cooperation and all? +++$+++ 1990s
Running away?  From what? +++$+++ 1950s
Okay. +++$+++ 1950s
Miles, how nice of you to see us -- may I introduce Howard D. Doyle of Doyle Oil. +++$+++ 2000s
Yeah, you had a piece of pussy on a plate in front of you, you'd probably kill it. +++$+++ 1980s
But it's possible. +++$+++ 1970s
Wallace has sacked York! +++$+++ 1990s
There is -- I've seen things through that window! Bickering, family fights, mysterious trips at night, knives, saws, rope -- and since last evening, not a sight or sound of his wife! Now you tell me where she is and what she's doing! +++$+++ 1950s
Thank you, sir. +++$+++ 2000s
Two words. +++$+++ 1990s
You cruise A.I.'s, you end up on tape. +++$+++ 1980s
We're all going. +++$+++ 1970s
Aw, you're tough. +++$+++ 1990s
This isn't fucking funny, Dante! +++$+++ 1990s
Run it then. +++$+++ 1980s
You gotta be kidding. +++$+++ 1970s
Remember that demon in the gut? Sometimes it's nothing more than wondering if the so-called civilized life has bred the balls and brains out of you.  That's what you want out of this, isn't it? +++$+++ 1990s
It's not that, it's just that...  It I get caught, I'll lose my science scholarship and everything. +++$+++ 1980s
I think we should see your uncle. +++$+++ 1980s
It should, or it will?  Least going back the way we came we know what we're up against. +++$+++ 1990s
In that case you can do it. You were quite happy to do a lot more last night. +++$+++ 1990s
No. This guy is big time.  These two are street-walking scum. +++$+++ 1990s
There's all kinds of horses, Ain't there?  Same with Cowboys. What they do's their affair.  I Don't preach and I don't judge.  I Ain't no dog-catcher. +++$+++ 1990s
We wanted you and Jimmy to have it someday. Something real and honest. +++$+++ 2000s
I haven't seen much of you. +++$+++ 1980s
I'll slip in, talk them into to come out, and you'll be free to blow holy high heaven the whole lot of them. +++$+++ 2000s
Faith. +++$+++ 1980s
It had better be good. +++$+++ 1930s
Let's face it, what the fuck are you doing in Las Vegas? +++$+++ 1990s
Mr. Smith -  -- the "complimentary couch." +++$+++ 1980s
He says on the photo he'll call tomorrow at eleven.  Why not come back then and listen for yourself. +++$+++ 1990s
Ana paira ninas. Koko's the brains. +++$+++ 1960s
Engine room reports auxiliary power restored. We can proceed at impulse power. +++$+++ 1980s
No sick people in the country, huh?... Just tell me one thing, Rhian. Leon’s story about the boy? You just took his word for it? +++$+++ 1990s
Stick with me, kid.  Looks big when you get here but you can cover it in five minutes. +++$+++ 1990s
How much? +++$+++ 1970s
Hey, I got a staff to pay, plus rent, plus I haven't billed a minute of my time since I started on this case, so you can quit hitting me up like I'm rich or something. +++$+++ 2000s
Which ranch? +++$+++ 1940s
Most authentic Mexican food in Springwood, which isn't saying much.  your parents still live around here? +++$+++ 1980s
Don't you want me to? +++$+++ 1990s
Accidents. Fatal. Each of your prior wives, so we've been informed. +++$+++ 1990s
How will they come at you? +++$+++ 1970s
Cosmo, this is Ronny, Johnny's brother. +++$+++ 1980s
You don't get the Mask code unless I go. +++$+++ 1990s
I can get it -- I can almost reach it, Dad. +++$+++ 1980s
Get me Air Support...  We'll be airborne and assault the ambush... +++$+++ 2000s
I'm so happy I could shit. +++$+++ 1990s
Why'd you stay behind?! +++$+++ 1990s
And you honestly expect me to believe all this? +++$+++ 1990s
Waynette! +++$+++ 1970s
That would be great.  It better help.  What can you do with yourself if all you do is look good? +++$+++ 1980s
Step inside. +++$+++ 1990s
Wire pull over? +++$+++ 1970s
Susan, I want you to stop this. And right now! +++$+++ 1940s
Are you just making that up to make me feel better? +++$+++ 1960s
...necklace... pearls... +++$+++ 1990s
This is my favorite part.  Even more treacherous and dangerous than he is charming and fascinating. He has never taken a single step or spoken a single word without some dishonorable or criminal intention. Every young girl he has successfully pursued has regretted it. +++$+++ 1990s
That's what I always say. +++$+++ 1980s
I'll sue. +++$+++ 1980s
Thanks, Doc. Maybe I'll come back with a date. Or an elephant. +++$+++ 1980s
Where is she? +++$+++ 1990s
You don't think I'm smart enough to be serious about. +++$+++ 1970s
A night in the hole? +++$+++ 2000s
Blow-dart hunting stick from Papua New Guinea. Very <u>very</u> rare, since the tribe's extinct. +++$+++ 2000s
I'm telling you he's not your husband at all. +++$+++ 1980s
A hundred and five years?  He really hung on, didn't he. +++$+++ 1980s
I know a great place.  ...UH...WARREN! +++$+++ 1990s
I can subpoena you, you know. I can get you up there on the stand. +++$+++ 1980s
I'm serious, man. Don't mention it. Ever. +++$+++ 2000s
Maria? +++$+++ 1930s
Lions and tigers and bears! +++$+++ 1930s
She great or what? +++$+++ 2000s
What a great surprise.  I didn't think we had a chance.  I heard you wanted to stay in Washington. +++$+++ 1980s
Congratulations, you've just graduated at the head of your class. +++$+++ 2000s
Any friends? +++$+++ 1990s
That gorilla in Man's clothing-- McGann. +++$+++ 1930s
You're on your way somewhere all right...the looney bin. +++$+++ 1980s
They got that kind of money? +++$+++ 2000s
Did you send this? Is it a joke? +++$+++ 2000s
Where's the old half--Mexican? +++$+++ 2000s
Pardon me? +++$+++ 1980s
Let's go. +++$+++ 1990s
You were the Yoni Yum girl from, let's see,  from nineteen sixty-eight through nineteen seventy. You've always smelled so nice. Like a little sister. The irony has just killed me. You, the Dew Girl, one of the few girls who doesn't need Dew. I loath the stink of females! They are so sweet the way God made them, then they start fooling around with men and soon they're stinking. Like rotten mushrooms, like an excessively chlorinated swimming pool, like a tuna fish's retirement party. They all stink. From the Queen of England to Bonanza Jellybean, they stink. +++$+++ 1990s
Take a top coat. +++$+++ 1950s
Walls of shining crystals, burning with red fire, furnishings of metals and jewels never seen by man... +++$+++ 1980s
You're a ringer.  She brought you in to replace me.  Out with the old. +++$+++ 1990s
What should I say? You did fine work. We'll wait on the lab. +++$+++ 1990s
No, they're living in Nice now. +++$+++ 1990s
What? +++$+++ 2000s
What do you mean? +++$+++ 1980s
I'd better get back.  Say goodbye here. +++$+++ 1990s
It's early for him. +++$+++ 1990s
Yes.  It's called accountability. +++$+++ 2000s
How about it? +++$+++ 1960s
Aiding an escaped criminal! And a little charge of kidnapping I'm looking into.  But that's the jail! There must be somebody there! +++$+++ 1940s
No. But I fear it's intention may have been to kill the peace accords and spark a civil war between the Hutu Militia and the Tutsi rebels. +++$+++ 2000s
Okay? +++$+++ 1970s
What? +++$+++ 1950s
White House boys want a private meeting. +++$+++ 1990s
Well, no. You agreed to stay on the air as long as we asked you to. The station entered into this on that understanding. If you had refused we'd have begun this with somebody else. You can't just change the rules in the middle of the game, son. It's not fair to us. More importantly, it's not fair to the viewers. They're interested in you. They've devoted hours and days and weeks of their lives to you. +++$+++ 1990s
Sorry... +++$+++ 1990s
Do you ever regret not having a family? +++$+++ 1990s
Marge-maintenance. +++$+++ 1990s
So I've heard-- +++$+++ 1990s
That aside for the moment, I'm struck by the tenor, the ill-spirit of your report... the degrading remarks by other aviators... innuendo about her performance in unrelated situations... even a reference to her sexual activity the weekend prior.  In my seven years on this committee, I've never seen a downed aviator treated like this.  Never.  I'm deeply disturbed by this report, Mr. Hayes.  Not just what it bodes for women in the military -- but for your own confirmation as well. +++$+++ 1990s
I don't think so. One come out here once an' I clipped him from behin' with a fence stake. They ain't bothered since. +++$+++ 1940s
I don't think this is the lightning you are looking for.  Drew's a good man.  I know I didn't seem to be completely in his corner before, but I've come to appreciate -- +++$+++ 1990s
Well, thanks a lot. +++$+++ 1980s
Barker's wife called me at three this morning; her husband apparently had told her to call if he hadn't called her by then. +++$+++ 1970s
Yes, sir, I am. +++$+++ 1980s
Just wait one fucking minute. +++$+++ 1990s
You wanna know? Turn on the T.V. Watch the fucking news! +++$+++ 1990s
I never hurt them. Never. +++$+++ 2000s
You wanna get coffee for two hours or something? We'll go next- +++$+++ 1970s
Tell me. +++$+++ 1990s
Make it out to cash! +++$+++ 1930s
Then what's the premonition of the lake supposed to mean? +++$+++ 2000s
Yes. +++$+++ 2000s
How often do you go? +++$+++ 1980s
Shit Honey, you could've told me. People might think it's about us! +++$+++ 2000s
Get <u>out</u> of here! +++$+++ 2000s
Why would you help me? +++$+++ 1990s
I didn't do anything.  It just happened. +++$+++ 1950s
If I knew where they were you wouldn't have to find them, would you? +++$+++ 2000s
Thank you.  Now, do you remember seeing any vehicles traveling near the site, on your way to or from? +++$+++ 1990s
Don't be crazy, mama. Take care of yourself. +++$+++ 1990s
No, thanks--I'm doing this on my own. +++$+++ 1990s
What'd I tell you? It doesn't catch fire! +++$+++ 1980s
You can't sell this to your friends. +++$+++ 2000s
It must be some kind of a gag. +++$+++ 1940s
Thirty minutes to break the code... Two hours for the five mechanicals. The seventh lock...that's out of my hands. +++$+++ 1980s
...again. +++$+++ 1940s
No, man, what we swingers were rebelling against were uptight squares like you, whose bag was money and world domination. We were innocent, man. If we'd known the consequences of our sexual liberation, we would have done things differently, but the spirit would have remained the same.  It's freedom, man. +++$+++ 1990s
<u>What</u>? Oh no! Better it was me. There isn't another good tomato within a hundred leagues. +++$+++ 1980s
Next Christmas. Is he Santa Claus who has left a present for Dorothy? What was it? An ear? Another ear?!!  What was it? +++$+++ 1990s
Oh, good. +++$+++ 1970s
Kirsty... Kirsty? +++$+++ 2000s
Why not? Why the fuck not? +++$+++ 2000s
I called your house. +++$+++ 1980s
Okay, okay, I'll be at the resta... +++$+++ 1990s
As long as you don't act like a fuckin' nut, we'll be just fine. +++$+++ 1990s
Cornelius has developed a brilliant hypothesis - +++$+++ 2000s
Bridge washed out—around Dawson. +++$+++ 1930s
Oh, Dear God, I should have guessed... +++$+++ 1980s
You know. +++$+++ 1990s
It looks old.     Did you get it a long time ago? +++$+++ 2000s
Yeah. Call him. +++$+++ 1990s
You know what gets me?  Those guys who went to the moon!  To the moon, boy! +++$+++ 1970s
No, no, no. +++$+++ 2000s
He's not responsive -- +++$+++ 2000s
Darling. +++$+++ 2000s
That first night with Pike. I made the mistake of letting him sit down at around 0300. +++$+++ 2000s
I might see you in Norfolk over the weekend. +++$+++ 1980s
Oh.  Well -- I'm not sure -- but you might try the First Presbyterian. That's on Allan Street. +++$+++ 1960s
Done.  Lets not talk about it anymore, let's have a good time. +++$+++ 1990s
We need him back. +++$+++ 1990s
Why'd you invite me here? +++$+++ 1980s
Where's the handle? +++$+++ 1980s
Is he with the girl? +++$+++ 2000s
We didn't talk about it -- you did. +++$+++ 1960s
I -- I don't know, dear... Perhaps there's some mistake. +++$+++ 2000s
That's 'Fronkonsteen.' +++$+++ 1970s
How about you? All right? +++$+++ 1990s
What did you say that for, Sarah? +++$+++ 1960s
"This is the story of Jimmy Bones/Black as night and hard as stones/Gold plated deuce, like the King of Siam/Got his switchblade loose, and a diamond on his hand..." There's the switchblade and there's the diamond.  Don't know where the deuce is parked. +++$+++ 2000s
Last night?  I was at home. +++$+++ 1990s
Yeah, why not? We're the good guys. +++$+++ 1970s
Do you know who this is? +++$+++ 2000s
Man, after taxes, lawyer fees, and paying off my daddy's bad credit, we didn't end up with a million.  We bought this house and I spent the rest on this.  It's the bomb, huh? +++$+++ 2000s
Where? +++$+++ 1940s
Helen... excuse me, we... +++$+++ 1990s
Was it ever a topic of conversation between the two of you afterward? +++$+++ 1980s
You rally think this'll draw the parent? +++$+++ 1990s
Everyone's.  This is a lawsuit.  We need to be able to contact the plaintiffs. +++$+++ 2000s
I've always denied the legend that you were in 'Our American Cousin' the night Lincoln was shot... +++$+++ 1950s
I was in it. +++$+++ 1950s
I'm a man. +++$+++ 1970s
That's a lot of people to die unknown. +++$+++ 1970s
What?!  Did you know that!? +++$+++ 1980s
Dad! +++$+++ 1990s
A whip?  Now that's going too far!  Some of these women have no shame! +++$+++ 2000s
What was I wearing? +++$+++ 2000s
...they... <u>you</u> know... +++$+++ 1990s
Let me tell you something.  Listen to me. +++$+++ 1990s
You just did. +++$+++ 1990s
I'm going after Dad. +++$+++ 1980s
Out in back. +++$+++ 1990s
Not me.  You work too often with the same people and you become friends -- clouds your judgement. +++$+++ 1990s
They never do, Mr. Barker. +++$+++ 1980s
It's going to be a long night.  It could take hours before we know something.  You should try to eat. +++$+++ 1990s
Who is it? +++$+++ 2000s
"As he loosened his manhood from beneath his robes, The Bishop muttered a Latin prayer. And then -- with a mighty thrust -- drove it into her very entrails --" +++$+++ 2000s
Because "Dr. Grant" isn't looking for Eric. Dr. Grant is looking for the coast. +++$+++ 2000s
We'd better go outside. Quickly. +++$+++ 1990s
How many fucking sources they think we got?-- +++$+++ 1970s
Here's a suggestion. Let's stop worrying about the concert for the time being and get the cops in on this Volvo situation. +++$+++ 1990s
Not without the name of the contact who can discount the bonds.  I may need to pry that information out of her.  What do you stand to gain? +++$+++ 2000s
He took it like a man.  Toss him in that drainage ditch. +++$+++ 2000s
Tell me something, Wes.  Are you crazy, greedy, or just stupid?  Jaeger says you're crazy. +++$+++ 1990s
Alright. You want some pie? +++$+++ 2000s
Okay, everybody, listen up! +++$+++ 1990s
She trusts me.  She'll do what I say. +++$+++ 1980s
What did you find? +++$+++ 2000s
Drew called from the AStar, they're still two minutes away. +++$+++ 1990s
Miles, I gotta tell you something. Victoria's coming to the wedding. +++$+++ 2000s
Been trying to figure out your secret. +++$+++ 1990s
I need your help, Joyce. +++$+++ 1980s
Some flies?  I think this qualifies as way more than "some." +++$+++ 2000s
You suggest what? I have no time for piddling suggestions from mumbling job applicants, my good man. Besides, Dr. Lester will see you now. I think that's what he said. +++$+++ 1990s
It doesn't say th... +++$+++ 1990s
She has no real grip on reality. +++$+++ 1990s
And I'd take it out on him. +++$+++ 1990s
Well, after the war, with so many of the town's boys killed, people around here didn't much feel like going to the movies, I guess.  Some of 'em moved away -- Los Angeles, Sacramento, San Francisco.  Wasn't much to keep 'em here, I expect. And now with this "television" thing -- people just aren't going out as much as they used to. +++$+++ 2000s
Yeah, fuck 'em.  No offense. +++$+++ 2000s
So you were stealing their honey. They should have killed you. +++$+++ 1980s
Hey, don't I get an encore? +++$+++ 1980s
Do you want to sit there, Jeff? +++$+++ 1980s
Sixteen. Well, nearly sixteen. +++$+++ 1980s
All right, love ya ma. Listen, before ya go just give us the goods, eh? +++$+++ 1990s
You are saying, in effect, that this is a forgery? +++$+++ 1930s
I don't know about you guys, but I'm starting to feel a really sexual vibe here. +++$+++ 2000s
My undying love.  Have some. +++$+++ 1980s
Yeah, they sure do make a lot of cold, hard, noise, Captain. +++$+++ 1960s
So what would a weekend in the country be without sex? +++$+++ 1980s
It was a wonderful set. +++$+++ 1970s
Yeah, pretty well. +++$+++ 2000s
Oh, I need your notes from the classes I missed. +++$+++ 2000s
-- is not a challenge. I need something I can sink my teeth into, professionally speaking. +++$+++ 2000s
Somehow, you're better. Different. You're getting ready to go. And I say... +++$+++ 2000s
Maranzano will think Masseria ordered the hit, and won't have no choice but to start the war. +++$+++ 1990s
Nothing like a little liveliness. +++$+++ 1990s
Is it gassed up? +++$+++ 2000s
Who? +++$+++ 1990s
I can't afford to get caught. +++$+++ 1990s
So then, tonight, we go over everything thoroughly, eh?  Especially the new papers - +++$+++ 1940s
Where was the call from. +++$+++ 2000s
Oh.  Like I'm not an interesting person. +++$+++ 1990s
Dr. Burton tells me you know who Batman is. +++$+++ 1990s
That's 'cause he's dead. +++$+++ 1990s
Selina ... more facets than Vicki, huh?  Funny, but sort of mysterious... +++$+++ 1990s
Oh, my God! +++$+++ 1990s
And how much are these? +++$+++ 1990s
They're trying to come through the door! +++$+++ 1970s
Shut up!  Sorry, dear, I lost control for a minute. +++$+++ 1990s
I'm sorry about Saturday, Dad.  It was just impossible to get away. +++$+++ 1980s
What did you see? +++$+++ 1980s
Shut up.  Cuff him to the rail. +++$+++ 1990s
Are you going to tell me you didn't feel something in there? +++$+++ 1990s
I can only stay for one drink, Ben. I've got to meet with Victor. +++$+++ 2000s
It's ok. +++$+++ 1990s
I got a hunch, Joe Buck, it's gonna be easier for you than most. +++$+++ 1960s
Nepal? Have you been? +++$+++ 1990s
Maybe just one word? Kaput? Because you're kaput, Price. +++$+++ 1950s
You've come far. You're a good man. I love you. +++$+++ 1990s
Maybe the demons are real. +++$+++ 1990s
The park? +++$+++ 1990s
Yes. +++$+++ 1990s
What? +++$+++ 1980s
I'll try to manage. +++$+++ 1990s
Never mind. +++$+++ 2000s
That's OK. +++$+++ 1990s
Wait a second, Hoffy. Schulz says he's our best friend. Maybe he can give us a little hint. +++$+++ 1950s
There's our shaving stuff - and there's Sugar. +++$+++ 1950s
They let you out? +++$+++ 1990s
Come on! We're wasting time! +++$+++ 1930s
Behind us? +++$+++ 1980s
It explains a lot. +++$+++ 2000s
He hadn't even been there. And all those years I thought he was dead. +++$+++ 1990s
Don't worry about anything, Frankie Five-Angels. +++$+++ 1970s
After their initial investment in the factory, Grendel didn't need them.  Told them to fuck off. They tried to get these C.D.s together in order to have proof of Grendel's involvement, so they could keep him in line.  Now's the fun part... +++$+++ 1990s
Sure. +++$+++ 1990s
But you can't think through this one.  You have to feel it. +++$+++ 1990s
I'm starting to understand what you're teaching me.  I mean the panties and the nostrils and all that shit...I mean I'm getting it-- +++$+++ 1980s
Behind me.  Over there. +++$+++ 1990s
I broke the man out of prison -- +++$+++ 1970s
They are? +++$+++ 1970s
If you want a partner, I think you should recalculate the split. +++$+++ 1990s
Can I ask you a question totally unrelated to your career? +++$+++ 1990s
We have to lose the window. +++$+++ 2000s
Four interviews. Four no-gos. +++$+++ 2000s
Did anyone in your family keep in touch with her? +++$+++ 1990s
They don't have anything except four walls and a roof, and that's all we need. +++$+++ 1990s
Data's positronic net contains classified information on the Enterprise. Command codes, security protocols... +++$+++ 1990s
Well yes -- you know that about George. +++$+++ 1970s
What friend is that? +++$+++ 1980s
I said, I've been real tired. +++$+++ 1970s
And without much discrimination. +++$+++ 1990s
I wish I'd had the chance to get to know him better.  Take him fishing or something. +++$+++ 2000s
What?! +++$+++ 1990s
I couldn't say it any better than Huxley. +++$+++ 1990s
I know you. This Shari is a passing fancy. +++$+++ 1990s
Hurry, Lynette. It's almost midnight. +++$+++ 1980s
That was my idea. +++$+++ 2000s
You don't know how glad I am to see youl +++$+++ 1950s
Maybe I ought to go out there. +++$+++ 1990s
You know, you're not a <U>bad</U>-looking girl. In fact--I think you're lovely. +++$+++ 1930s
Mussolini is raping Sicily like every Roman before him. So our brothers are coming to America. Soldiers willing to fight and die. Men who know the meaning of honor. +++$+++ 1990s
I beg your pardon . . . ?  Some gratitude. +++$+++ 2000s
What? +++$+++ 2000s
'Hell, I may as well do something useful. +++$+++ 1990s
I do not understand... +++$+++ 1990s
The kid needs a man to show him -- +++$+++ 1980s
Aye. Speak then if ye must. +++$+++ 1990s
Let's try it again, only this time I'm going to stick my tongue in your mouth. When I do that I want you to massage my tongue with yours. That's what first base is. +++$+++ 1990s
We'll try again. +++$+++ 1960s
That'd be fine, Bobby. +++$+++ 1990s
I love that dream. +++$+++ 1990s
Now what? +++$+++ 1990s
Flies the plane.... +++$+++ 1980s
Fuck band practice... If you're gonna be a painter you're gonna have to break a few hearts – you don't wanna be like Tony Bennett.. +++$+++ 1990s
This lot's got to be worth 50 quid! +++$+++ 1990s
--my number one fan. +++$+++ 1990s
Morpheus. +++$+++ 1990s
But you say he hasn't shown up, you think he backed out? +++$+++ 1990s
Baseball? +++$+++ 1940s
Once it's spent you won't have to worry about it. +++$+++ 1990s
You swore.  You owe me a quarter.  Did you remember my egg carton?  I told you I needed my egg carton for seed planting today. +++$+++ 1990s
What do you mean by haul?  What are you not telling me here? +++$+++ 1990s
You won. +++$+++ 2000s
Better get him to a hospital. +++$+++ 1960s
Mine. +++$+++ 1990s
Who is who? +++$+++ 1990s
I care about you, a - But I just don't have those kind of feelings for you. I'm sorry. I'm not in love with you. +++$+++ 1990s
Is there a coup de grace in here, somewh... +++$+++ 1990s
I think Mister Worf is suggesting that we go outside for a little stroll... +++$+++ 1990s
Sure.  And the two of 'em used my legs for a wishbone.  Nearly snapped me in half. +++$+++ 1990s
I'm all right. +++$+++ 2000s
Shut up, dear boy- no gloating allowed. +++$+++ 1980s
Why? You can't even lift one. +++$+++ 1980s
Haven't seen her since that day. Ella thinks she might be waiting in the woods for another chance but..I don't think so. Mama thinks she's gone for good. Says she can feel it. +++$+++ 1990s
It's fine by me, Jesse. +++$+++ 2000s
Yes.  Is this something that I can talk ab... +++$+++ 1990s
You son-of—a—bitch, I'm going to kill you. +++$+++ 1990s
I didn't say nothin' 'bout credit, Mr. Howard. +++$+++ 1970s
-- murdered by pirates is good -- +++$+++ 1980s
What's the first street? +++$+++ 1990s
Ted, I'm leaving you. +++$+++ 1970s
Don't you know? Everyone on Rura Penthe is here for life. +++$+++ 1990s
You gentlemen care for a drink? +++$+++ 1960s
I've enjoyed being man. +++$+++ 1970s
Hey. Tits. I'm taking your neighbor to the country. maybe something for you too. +++$+++ 1990s
You've certainly thought this out, haven't you? +++$+++ 1980s
Yes? +++$+++ 1980s
It's like sweet and sour, and salty butter. +++$+++ 1990s
Is that right? +++$+++ 1990s
Probably just some exec ducking an ex-wife. +++$+++ 1980s
On a scale of one to ten: two. But --  -- she'll take care of you, Myers. She's a tough one. +++$+++ 2000s
It is possible... and I know this isn't something you want to hear. Your daughter may have tried to hide a note where she thought you would eventually find it, but where she knew your husband would never find it.  She might have wanted to tell you something... +++$+++ 1990s
I had it coming from someone. +++$+++ 2000s
The hell with that. No one's gonna tell me who I can and can't work with. +++$+++ 1990s
What? +++$+++ 1990s
The hospital. +++$+++ 1990s
Professor Waldman. +++$+++ 1930s
Damn, you're a shrewd one. Shrewd. +++$+++ 1980s
Cool! +++$+++ 1990s
Please... no?  You mean "not here" -- that's it? You're a private Available but particular.  Don't worry. There's no one here but me. And you. +++$+++ 1970s
Well, shoot! Maybe there was! +++$+++ 1950s
Where do you get off pretending to be my secretary? +++$+++ 2000s
Thank you.  This was so unnecessary.  I hope you've noticed that Otis isn't barking as much.  We keep him in at night. +++$+++ 2000s
And there's the winner of the Truman Capote look-alike contest. +++$+++ 1970s
Are you all right, Shelly? +++$+++ 1980s
That was fun. +++$+++ 1990s
Just, if you will, confine yourself to the main building. It's nearly bedtime. +++$+++ 1970s
Wouldn't know what to do with it all -- +++$+++ 1990s
Not all of us, 007. +++$+++ 1990s
Now there you are completely wrong. If we sit down for a little chat, I'm sure we won't run out of conversation and what's more it won't be dull. +++$+++ 1930s
I don't know...  ...maybe it depends on what you were like before you... +++$+++ 1990s
Bastard bit my chopper. +++$+++ 1990s
They check in alone? +++$+++ 1990s
I guess I thought I was protecting you. +++$+++ 1990s
You said, "Will it change..." Wife. Will it change... +++$+++ 1970s
Calm?... He doesn't seem so to me... He was awake all night. +++$+++ 1960s
Honey? +++$+++ 1970s
We want to frighten you away.  So that you'll move out. +++$+++ 1980s
Just my church and my boys. We all had to go to school and learn hand talking. I just thank the Lord they can see. +++$+++ 1970s
That is correct. And how do I decide? +++$+++ 2000s
Well, see, I was talking to Mr. McAllister about my leg and everything... and how I still want to, you know, do something for the school and -- +++$+++ 1990s
--These circumstances are mitigated. Right now. They're mitigated. +++$+++ 1990s
Okay. Let's get serious. Of course I know the Cult of Good is not good. Ever since I saw what they did in Atlanta, it has been my mission to expose them. I've followed them to Oasisburg and soon will have enough hard evidence to bring them to real justice. That computer disc could be the final piece to the puzzle. This isn't just a story, Selina--another damn Pulitzer--this is my life. +++$+++ 2000s
How old are you? +++$+++ 1990s
INT. POSTAL VAN - DAY +++$+++ 1990s
We played backgammon? +++$+++ 1990s
Oh well, you know. +++$+++ 2000s
What am I supposed to do? +++$+++ 1980s
Larry Mitchell found out.  So you killed him. +++$+++ 1990s
Yes. +++$+++ 1990s
No. +++$+++ 1980s
Whatever you do to me... no matter what you'll make me right.  Every word I have spoken will be confirmed. +++$+++ 2000s
A blockbuster. But quality. No mutants or maniacs. This one's gonna be my "Driving Miss Daisy". +++$+++ 1990s
Sure. How about the beach? +++$+++ 1990s
They told me I was too old to serve. +++$+++ 1990s
Of course. She is my sister. I tell her almost everything. +++$+++ 1980s
I'd sure like that favor you offered a while back. +++$+++ 1990s
No, no – +++$+++ 1990s
That's right. And guess who's the new King of the Unemployment Line. +++$+++ 2000s
Whatever happened to that old saying "Love Thy Neighbor." +++$+++ 1950s
I'm not, but alot of my soldiers are. Glass the planet ! +++$+++ 1990s
When you get scared, the brain releases a chemical, same chemical it releases when somebody's...  in high school, the thing to do was to take the girl to a scary movie. +++$+++ 1990s
And, fine, alright, and fine... what are <u>you</u>doing, this whole time? +++$+++ 2000s
Sorry. I'm better with men. +++$+++ 2000s
All of the James Gang's encounters have been with local law enforcement who, quite frankly, are no match for this group's cunning. +++$+++ 2000s
'Message from command.  Would you like them to send in the HKs?' +++$+++ 1990s
Did I? I tried so hard! I really concentrated! Oh, I'm so happy! +++$+++ 2000s
Ed, you said you were getting permission. +++$+++ 1990s
How are we going to live, Wolfi? Do you want me to go into the streets and beg? +++$+++ 1980s
As large as castles.  You are still light as air, one hundred men can't move me. +++$+++ 1990s
Or twenty-four as it is in Earth time. Furthermore, if you will reveal yourself, your enemies will have a way of getting at you where you are vulnerable: by hurting the people you care for.  Ah, this Earth...this world you live in, Kal-El...  Resist its temptations, its rewards, especially its political system. +++$+++ 1970s
You see -- the electricity's been neutralized -- all over the world. +++$+++ 2000s
Butt-munch. +++$+++ 1990s
Yellow's a bad color for me.  I'll look green at breakfast. +++$+++ 1980s
Magda? She's not my grandmother -- actually she rents the apartment right next to mine. Her husband passed away a couple years ago so she doesn't like to be alone. +++$+++ 1990s
In an hour they're gone! +++$+++ 1990s
I'm aware that I don't look so great, but I thought you'd be glad to see me. +++$+++ 1980s
So we don't know for sure about you, either. +++$+++ 1990s
You sure you're OK Teddy? You're not bowling are you? +++$+++ 1990s
That sounds nice. +++$+++ 1990s
Hardly. +++$+++ 1930s
Commander?... Call me Laredo? +++$+++ 1990s
I think I can stabilize the fields around the singularity, that should prevent another power drain. +++$+++ 1990s
What's your real name? +++$+++ 1980s
So what did he say when he called? +++$+++ 1990s
You assemble this, on the instant, from these few observations? +++$+++ 2000s
Howard Hunt? ... Jesus Christ, you open up that scab ... and you uncover a lot of pus. +++$+++ 1990s
Forgive me, Don Bobadilla -- those positions have already been taken. +++$+++ 1990s
Looking for someone? +++$+++ 2000s
Maybe the maid did it. +++$+++ 1990s
I think they shoot right outta its mouth, hook you, and pull you right in.  Good thing we stopped it before it killed anybody else. +++$+++ 1990s
No, I'm fine.  I'm...  ... wonderful.  Just walking down the street with you again. +++$+++ 2000s
What I'm saying, they're getting some help. +++$+++ 1970s
What do we know? It was first sighted off the French Polynesian Pacific. An area that has been exposed to dozens of nuclear tests over the last thirty years. +++$+++ 1990s
Your daughters went to the prom. +++$+++ 1990s
Because they get outstanding settlements. And Mother is determined that this time there's no turning back. +++$+++ 2000s
Cute? +++$+++ 2000s
I'm so tired -- DR. DREYFUSS Here -- drink this. +++$+++ 1960s
Let's discuss it when I'm unbound. +++$+++ 1990s
I... +++$+++ 2000s
Funny? +++$+++ 1940s
I should be in by two. +++$+++ 1990s
And dogged when I set my mind to something. +++$+++ 1990s
I have to see somebody. +++$+++ 1980s
No, but I've confirmed the reelection rally is the target.  How much C-4 is missing? +++$+++ 1990s
I saw that Colonel's Huey on the point -- +++$+++ 1970s
While you were employed at Wyant Wheeler, you did everything you could to make sure no one knew you were an active homosexual, correct? +++$+++ 1990s
An "automaton"?!  Please!  I'm a biomechanical organism.  Well, what's left of one.  What's left of all of them, actually.  I am the last...  ... And "these fragments I have shored against my ruins."  T.S. Eliot.  You wouldn't know him yet but you'll just love him, he's divine, if a little dour.  Very shy though... hiding over here... +++$+++ 2000s
How much time do we have? +++$+++ 2000s
Big case? +++$+++ 2000s

Creed's great. +++$+++ 1970s
What? +++$+++ 1990s
You got some mighty fucking fine bad timing Adam. We got a rehearsal situation here. +++$+++ 1990s
I'm not honest? +++$+++ 1990s
Well, I got the idea when I was doing some research and I discovered that Cook's Chicken used to be called Coon's Chicken, and so I decided to do my project based on this discovery as kind of a comment on racism... and the way racism is whitewashed over in our culture... +++$+++ 2000s
Do you feel you have a chance? +++$+++ 1970s
I do love you.  Let's get lost together. +++$+++ 1990s
Have fun storming the castle. +++$+++ 1980s
They'll have to come right past us. +++$+++ 1990s

No. You know too many sick ladies. +++$+++ 1970s
Are you saying this filthy godless son of a pig knows where to find The City Of The Dead? Truly? +++$+++ 1990s
We have much to discuss.  Tomorrow. +++$+++ 1990s
Oh!  You're here. +++$+++ 1980s

He's a riot. +++$+++ 1980s
Just what makes you and them Krauts so buddy-buddy? +++$+++ 1950s

He was a...good lover? +++$+++ 1990s
Nice. +++$+++ 2000s
You're terrible. +++$+++ 1990s
Yeah, but... +++$+++ 1990s
I'll see you there. +++$+++ 2000s
Oh, but I just told you. -- +++$+++ 1940s
Yes I did, I'm sorry. +++$+++ 1970s
Then stand there an' wait till I'm done -- Creed's good, yeah, he's real fine but I gotta boy, y'know Big Dipper, who's got the stuff it takes to be a champ -- He's mean, quick, an' big -- What more d'ya need? Okay, go to work...  Hey -- Yeah -- Whatta ya want? +++$+++ 1970s
Aniline dyes in the inks in felt-tip pens -- which is what Lecktor has -- are transparent to infrared. The Tooth Fairy's ballpoint isn't... +++$+++ 1980s

Now look -- here's a list of the people I invited -- they're all the right kind of people -- or did I miss anybody? +++$+++ 2000s
Geller, we've been over this. You're a great copy editor. Maybe my best copy editor. You're not a reporter. +++$+++ 1990s
Birdy-- +++$+++ 2000s
Zeke.  Git! +++$+++ 1930s
Baryonyx? +++$+++ 2000s
No. no. no. Wait. Wait. +++$+++ 1990s
I <u>must</u> go. +++$+++ 1930s
Everything breaks at once. +++$+++ 1980s
I didn't do it. I didn't do it. +++$+++ 1950s
Yes. +++$+++ 1990s
Bullshit yourself! +++$+++ 1980s
You never had The Talk, did you? +++$+++ 1990s
Used to be against the law, didn't it? +++$+++ 1970s
I drink. +++$+++ 2000s
Is the wind tired out there? +++$+++ 1930s
Were you wicked? +++$+++ 1990s
Michael...  Do what you can. +++$+++ 1990s
They are...it happened in tonight's quake.  It happened just fifteen minutes ago. You must've felt it. +++$+++ 1990s
Aw, find yourself a shoplifter to roll. +++$+++ 1970s
You can see me now. +++$+++ 1990s
Very nice. +++$+++ 1980s
Then what? +++$+++ 1920s
I have to get you home by one. +++$+++ 2000s
I won't do it because he wants me to do it, even if I want to do it. +++$+++ 1980s
What the fuck is that? +++$+++ 2000s
Come on.  Let me buy you something to eat.  Looks like you could use the company. +++$+++ 1990s
You got caught. It's all fun and fuckin' games till you get caught. But now we gotcha. OK, Mr. Elliot actor, you've just made the big time - +++$+++ 1990s
You wanted to become a member of the most powerful clique in the school. If I wasn't already the head of it, I'd want the same thing. +++$+++ 1980s
Let's just kill them. +++$+++ 1990s
How do you mean? +++$+++ 2000s
Could be she's just a nice, respectable girl -- there are millions of them. +++$+++ 1960s
That morning.  He was talking to me and Leon about marriage. +++$+++ 2000s
No. +++$+++ 1990s
How soon can I get a plane to Seattle? +++$+++ 1990s
Well, there's a dead cat over here on the edge of my lawn, Louis. I think it might be your daughter's. +++$+++ 1980s
That's bullshit. Just shoot. +++$+++ 1980s
Good to meet you, Dr. Wigand. +++$+++ 1990s
You afraid of violence? +++$+++ 2000s
Well, of course, right... +++$+++ 1990s
What are you talking about -- "don't get emotional." If you ask me, you haven't gotten emotional ENOUGH about this man. _ 98. +++$+++ 1990s
Baby, don't talk like that, baby. +++$+++ 1990s
Yeah, yeah.  Jesus. +++$+++ 2000s
Seven homes along the Black River so far... +++$+++ 2000s

No.  Your cabbie is floating down a storm drain or stuffed in the trunk of a cab. +++$+++ 2000s
The boys and I were just having a philosophical discussion about women and cigars. Some interesting connections there, don't you think? +++$+++ 1990s
In what way? +++$+++ 1990s
Is it okay? +++$+++ 1990s
I can't. +++$+++ 1980s
I don't believe you. +++$+++ 2000s
How much? +++$+++ 1990s
Have you considered my offer? +++$+++ 1990s
Well? +++$+++ 1980s
Wouldn't think of it. Because tomorrow...  We're going to the chapel and we're... +++$+++ 1980s
Are you two gals all funny with each other? +++$+++ 2000s
Hi ma. +++$+++ 1990s

...the disciplines: bondage, domination and humiliation. +++$+++ 1970s
Well, I've flown seven million miles. And I've been waitin' on people almost twenty years. The best job I could get after my bust was Cabo Air, which is about the worst job you can get in this industry. I make about sixteen thousand, with retirement benefits, ain't worth a damn. And now with this arrest hanging over my head, I'm scared. If I lose my job I gotta start all over again, but I got nothin' to start over with. I'll be stuck with whatever I can get. And that scares me more than Ordell. +++$+++ 1990s
Wait, dear boy. Just wait. Hand me those pliars. +++$+++ 1980s
The house is rented in your name. +++$+++ 1990s
You found your way to us and we weren't easy to reach, were we? +++$+++ 1930s
She's ready. +++$+++ 1980s
I think that's what's happening... +++$+++ 1990s
Oh sure. The American answer to everything. Pills.  No, this is --  -- natural. +++$+++ 1980s

You know. Your love machine... the throbbing thrill hammer... your thing! +++$+++ 1980s
They nail him for it bad ? +++$+++ 1970s
Photographer? +++$+++ 1990s
Sure but what good will that do? +++$+++ 2000s
Stop it. I'm... +++$+++ 2000s
Okay.  Alright.  Okey-dokey.  Now, we need the nanobot.  The nanobot that initiated the reaction.  Once we have that we can stabilize the meltdown.  Simple really.  No problem. +++$+++ 1990s
Sir, I understand this is a terrible breach of protocol, but please, I beg you to hear our plea. We are Thermians from the Klatu Nebula.  Our people are being systematically hunted and slaughtered by Roth'h'ar Sarris of Fatu-Krey. Sarris wants the Omega 13. We are to meet in negotiation. However our past efforts in this regard have been nothing short of disastrous. The flames, the death...  Please Captain, you are our last hope.  We have secured a limousine. +++$+++ 1990s
Until Thursday, then, Contessa Mio. +++$+++ 1960s

They have security cameras.  Rooney would see you coming. +++$+++ 2000s
Afraid I'd give Mitch. +++$+++ 1960s
With Hypnocyl? +++$+++ 1980s
That's what I have to believe... +++$+++ 1980s
Which way did he go? +++$+++ 1990s
You are the younger of two... +++$+++ 2000s
You're not...an orphan are you? +++$+++ 1980s
Like? +++$+++ 1970s
Well, now, you just know all there is about bein' a mechanic, don't you?  Didn't you read the sign. +++$+++ 1990s

Oh no, Jam. I'm not falling for that twice. +++$+++ 1990s
Really? +++$+++ 2000s
I wanna go home. +++$+++ 1980s
I'm afraid that's not true.  Will you want me to stay on till Monday? +++$+++ 1980s
Are you related to the deceased, Mr. Chance? +++$+++ 1970s
We're outta here. +++$+++ 1980s
Yeah, they're bad for your health.  I'm tryin' to look out for you... +++$+++ 1990s
How did you learn English? +++$+++ 1970s
But you're a doctor. You kill people every day. +++$+++ 1990s
You are.  Now. +++$+++ 1980s
Takes a licking but keeps on ticking...  ... For a while anyway. +++$+++ 2000s
Detective Williams!! Detective Williams!! +++$+++ 1980s
Goodnight. +++$+++ 1940s
It's just a feeling.  Don't you sense it, too? +++$+++ 2000s
I want your feelings about it. +++$+++ 1970s
And you, M'sieu Giron, seem to be disturbing my examination of <u>this</u> <u>report</u>. +++$+++ 1930s
One: "We want freedom. We want the power to determine the destiny of our Black Community." Two: "We want full employment for our people." Three: "We want to end the robbery by the white man of our Black Community." Christ, they're asking for reparations... +++$+++ 1990s
When there's something to move, it's too easy not to.  Do you know how many colleges are in a twenty mile radius? U. Mass, Amherst, B.U.... +++$+++ 2000s
Charlie, take your gum, stick it under your ass and keep it warm. +++$+++ 1980s
I don't know. +++$+++ 2000s
There was a brown dog that ran across the road up there, right by the dump, and Dolores slowed down not to hit him, and he ran into the woods.  And then Dolores drove on and turned onto the Marlowe road, as usual.  I remember that.  I'm remembering it pretty clearly. +++$+++ 1990s
We may go out for coffee after the meeting so don't expect us before midnight. +++$+++ 1990s
No.  Not even you. +++$+++ 1980s
Know what? +++$+++ 1970s
Why do people think I'm Tyler Durden? +++$+++ 1990s
Oh, no sir-ee.  If yo don't have a reservation you can skip to ma-loo. +++$+++ 1970s
Well, in that event, it would be good manners on the part of the other man to let him have her. +++$+++ 1930s
Thirty years. Maybe more. +++$+++ 2000s
When this ship docks, I'm getting off with you. +++$+++ 1990s
People pay good money for that? +++$+++ 2000s
Then go. +++$+++ 1980s
I think I got one today. +++$+++ 1990s
Mitch?  Do... do you think they'll be all right? In the trunk? Can they breath? +++$+++ 1960s
Oh my God! She's two-timing PRINCIPAL COLLINS! +++$+++ 2000s

Hardly new news. +++$+++ 1990s
Good Lord.  So the construction guys say it'll take about a week to fix the roof. Damn airline better not fuck us on the shingle match. +++$+++ 2000s
Anyone with taste, anyone with breeding.... A gentleman, would choose British racing green, with maybe a tan interior...but when you buy a red car, with a black interior and wire wheels, you have one thing on your mind and one thing only and I'm too much of a gentleman to say what that one thing is...in front of the children. +++$+++ 1990s
That must be the tenth alienist they've had on Williams. Even if he wasn't crazy before, he would be after ten of those babies got through psychoanalyzing him.  Gimme the desk. +++$+++ 1940s
Then just give me one of your explanations that all three of us'll buy. +++$+++ 2000s
What happened at that signing? +++$+++ 2000s

Ever heard of the Mary Celeste? +++$+++ 2000s
You're out! I'm not working with either one of you! +++$+++ 1990s
...They  gave  Dude  a  beeper,  so whenever these guys call-- +++$+++ 1990s
Why don't we go take a swim? +++$+++ 1980s
You are, I was about to say, no longer eligible. +++$+++ 1980s
I probably woulda busted on you too... and what a shame that woulda been. +++$+++ 2000s
Agent Lowry? +++$+++ 1990s
Was that Meredith? +++$+++ 1990s
Look Anne, you're not serious about this, are you? +++$+++ 1930s
No. But when he's in that car... +++$+++ 2000s
Then we'll be right where we are now. +++$+++ 1990s
You'd be killing a friend.  Don't you know how much I like you? +++$+++ 1970s
You do seem much more disposed toward him than I understand, Ernest. Did I miss something? +++$+++ 1990s
Sure. +++$+++ 2000s
I know I was acting funny---I'm sorry. It's just...I miss it. +++$+++ 1980s
And, and, and, I did it.  And I put a kid through school. She...and...Cold calling, fella. Door to door.  But you don't know. You don't know.  You never heard of a streak.  You never heard of "marshaling your sales force..." What are you, you're a secretary, John.  Fuck you.  That's my message for you.  Fuck you and kiss my ass. You don't like it, I'll go talk to Jerry Graff.  Period.  Fuck you. Put me on the board.  And I want three worthwhile leads today and I don't want any bullshit about them and I want 'em close together 'cause I'm going to hit them all today.  That's all I have to say to you. +++$+++ 1990s
Fine. +++$+++ 2000s
Rodger Young, prepare to receice outgoing fire...!  I'll take the first group. +++$+++ 1990s
You have a recent scar on the back of your hand. +++$+++ 2000s
Well.  It's for you. +++$+++ 1990s
Too much excitement. How about the surrey. Can you fix it? +++$+++ 1940s
Who? +++$+++ 1980s
Okay that hurt. +++$+++ 2000s
The killer was trying to get to her. That sorority girl was a distraction. +++$+++ 1990s
Show off.  Hey, boss tune.  "Come Fly with Me." +++$+++ 1990s
Now you must listen to me. This force is like a parasite, or a virus. It feeds on doubt, suspicion, discord... you must clear your mind as we reach out for her. +++$+++ 1990s
Republican? +++$+++ 1970s
Don't tell me it's not the gas!  Your mother thought she smelled gas. +++$+++ 1980s
Then what is it? +++$+++ 1990s
Have I got things to tell you! +++$+++ 1950s
It could be a man. +++$+++ 1940s
Terry Valentine. +++$+++ 1990s
We have been in difficult places before, haven't we? +++$+++ 1940s
I have to help out in my father's hardware store. They're giving me sort of my own hours for a while, which is nice. +++$+++ 1980s
Hartman, if you take this desk out of this building, I'll put you behind bars. +++$+++ 1940s
Okay, Mom. +++$+++ 1980s
So... everything sounds... wonderful? +++$+++ 2000s
When you say this funny feeling, you mean the state of mind brought on by the treatment they gave you? +++$+++ 1970s
Now get talkin' +++$+++ 2000s
You're a shit. +++$+++ 2000s
You gotta shave before you leave the house in a dress like that and I don't mean your legs.  Why didn't you jump on her?  What's happening to you? +++$+++ 1990s
Do you think I'm having a good time? Do you think I'm just *teasing* you? Do you think I *know* whether I want you or Wally? +++$+++ 1990s
You're all packed.  And here's your bus ticket. You're on your way back to St. Anne's. +++$+++ 1950s
And break her heart and mine? +++$+++ 1990s
I want a chopper on the roof in three minutes. To Meigs Field.  At Meigs have them warn up and flight- prep the Gulf Stream. +++$+++ 1980s
Maybe - just 'maybe' - when their ship doesn't return - they'll decide not to come here, after all. +++$+++ 1950s
Good morning. What does this mean? +++$+++ 1930s
Borrowed. +++$+++ 1990s
He could let you have your vacation. +++$+++ 1990s
What are you doing! +++$+++ 1980s
What do you think, dumbshit? +++$+++ 2000s
Well, sub us, then, mate. I'm expecting a rent cheque. +++$+++ 1990s
But surely, Professor, you don't intend we disregard the more... philosophical works. +++$+++ 1930s
Lighten up. +++$+++ 2000s
Just doing my job. +++$+++ 1990s
Pinot Grigio.  We're considering it for the appetizer. +++$+++ 1990s
Yes, sir. +++$+++ 1960s
That judgment is not more important than their right under agreement with Webb to defend their farms & families... Major Heyward was at John Cameron's. He saw what it was. +++$+++ 1970s
...This'll sometimes help. +++$+++ 1990s
I can look and see. +++$+++ 1970s
Clemenza promised Rosato three territories in the Bronx after he died, and then you took over and welched. +++$+++ 1970s
From the magazine? +++$+++ 1970s
Hi. +++$+++ 1990s
So what happened to the barbecues, and fishing? +++$+++ 1990s
Larry, I don't know how to say this, but I think we got a shark problem. A real one. +++$+++ 1970s
That would be a catastrophic mistake. +++$+++ 2000s
The answer is NEVER, Ted, NEVER. Except maybe in your dreams. +++$+++ 2000s
I guess it is. But I personally wouldn't care to be head of a business that kept losing money. That wouldn't be common sense. Incidentally, where is the $180,000 coming from? +++$+++ 1930s
I said the plan was right here. +++$+++ 2000s
What's baseball? +++$+++ 1990s
You there? +++$+++ 2000s
He wasn't going to shoot her, you murdering son of a bitch! +++$+++ 1990s
Of course I will. +++$+++ 1980s
Is that why you're with him? +++$+++ 1990s
I'm doing a piece on right-wing groups, post Oklahoma City. I hear you're an important figure in those circles. You have a lot of interesting ideas.... +++$+++ 2000s
And what did they say about me? +++$+++ 1960s
How did you do that, Mrs Spitz? +++$+++ 1990s
I can't take shorthand. +++$+++ 1940s
Dr. Woodly. +++$+++ 1970s
Better ask Paul D. +++$+++ 1990s
What is it, Max? Want to wash the car, or are you doing a little spying in your off hours? +++$+++ 1950s
Nobody ever said that -- There's his picture. +++$+++ 1970s
Nuwanda?  Please? +++$+++ 1980s
I don't know... please... tell me I'm dead... +++$+++ 2000s
I can explain. +++$+++ 1990s
I'm getting to your rug. My  father and I don't get along; he doesn't approve of my lifestyle and, needless to say, I don't approve of his. Still, I hardly wish to make my father's embezzlement a police matter, so I'm proposing that you try to recover the money from the people you delivered it to. +++$+++ 1990s
I only met Kurtz once. +++$+++ 1970s
We'll use smoke pots. Like the Army uses. +++$+++ 1960s
I'll take you home, Angela.  Why don't you leave those with us for a while? +++$+++ 1990s
And you don't know how they open, is that what you are saying? +++$+++ 1990s
Oh! Are you really? +++$+++ 1980s
Don't worry about me, baby. I just wanted you to have a good time. +++$+++ 1990s
No. And I want to be in that room a half second after Mecklen calls to say the deal's done. We've got a sheriff's task force on stand-by. +++$+++ 2000s
Who are you? +++$+++ 1930s
I don't know. I don't know what's happening. +++$+++ 1960s
She's Cuban. +++$+++ 1990s
The Red Sox were my world. I surrendered my existence to a team that couldn't win the big one. +++$+++ 2000s
That's right. +++$+++ 1980s
That's Paul Owen. +++$+++ 2000s
Me neither. See what we've got on a guy named Alan Stanwyk, okay? I need it right away. +++$+++ 1980s
Well, it was nothin' specific he said, it just seemd like it all hit him really hard, his wife dyin' - +++$+++ 1990s
I'm not picking it up. +++$+++ 1990s
No, she's going home to her family. She'll join me in a few weeks... +++$+++ 1970s
Are you safe? +++$+++ 1970s
The lysine contingency - it's intended to prevent the spread of the animals is case they ever got off the island, but we could use it now.  Dr. Wu inserted a gene that makes a single faulty enzyme in protein metabolism. Animals can't manufacture the amino acid lysine.  Unless they're continually supplied with lysine by us, they'll go into a coma and die. +++$+++ 1990s
And no vampire here has discourse with God or the Devil? +++$+++ 1990s
Presumed dead.  No one knows. +++$+++ 1940s
I've come to strike a bargain with you.  I wish to learn the power of changing. +++$+++ 1990s
Nuke...tell me something.  Did you hit me with your right or your left? +++$+++ 1980s
That right? +++$+++ 1970s
Indeed.  I'd pay for the privilege of drawing your head. +++$+++ 1990s
It hasn't adjusted. +++$+++ 1980s
Looks like at the end of the day we finally find out who's better than who, don't we, Epps?  Like I said; I expected more from you. +++$+++ 1990s
Do you really want to go back to the runt doctors in Emergency who keep telling us they can't help? +++$+++ 1990s
Why? +++$+++ 1990s
Eight-thirty in the chapel. +++$+++ 1970s
Hay? Yeah? So teach me a lesson. +++$+++ 1990s
He comes out of the cafeteria line, he's nervous, he spills his corn, and he asks you to the dance! +++$+++ 1980s
Look, I'm shot - it hurts. +++$+++ 1960s
It wasn't one thing, if that's what you mean.  I just... I can't live here anymore. I can't live where stupidity is embraced and nurtured as if it were a virtue. +++$+++ 1970s
Well -- I guess I'll have to ask her out on a date and find out what's -- +++$+++ 1960s
What ? +++$+++ 1990s
He takes a cut of our earnings and invests it for us.  He makes us quit the life at thirty.  He doesn't let us use narcotics and he doesn't abuse us.  Can your policeman's mentality grasp those contradictions? +++$+++ 1990s
That's already happened hoss. It's naive to think otherwise. +++$+++ 2000s
Careful... +++$+++ 2000s
So what is it you want to know? +++$+++ 1990s
Okay? +++$+++ 1970s
Give it up.  If you threw yourself- +++$+++ 1940s
Can you hold?  Can you try? +++$+++ 1990s
Call Dad! +++$+++ 2000s
A cold drink? Okay? +++$+++ 1960s
The search for the Cup of Christ is the search for the divine in all of us. +++$+++ 1980s
All the time. We all live in Southie. I live with three of them now. +++$+++ 1990s
Well, you know, maybe something else until this whole puppet thing turns around. +++$+++ 1990s
I told you. I have to go back into the past. Once more. For the last time. +++$+++ 1950s
And leave a tip in every hat-check room in town? +++$+++ 1950s
Yeah, sorry about that.  I had this meeting with this guy. +++$+++ 2000s
My name is Camille -- Camille Johnson and I'm the Supervisor of this school. What's your name? +++$+++ 1970s
How much? +++$+++ 1960s
"John James Urgayle."  The Chief. +++$+++ 1990s
I can use the station in Medical, keep an eye on Justin... +++$+++ 1990s
The Box, Joey.  He wants the Box. +++$+++ 1990s
Yes, they are. +++$+++ 1980s
There's no way of knowing.  Without a key -- a primer, to help us, maybe never. +++$+++ 1990s
Ever get shot at, run over, sandbagged at night because people got unfavorable publicity from your camera? +++$+++ 1950s
Did I? My mistake. +++$+++ 1990s
Of course not. +++$+++ 1990s
Crane. +++$+++ 1960s
Well, we can hope, can't we? We certainly don't have any leads. A ghost mask, a cellular phone -- not much there. +++$+++ 1990s
Yeah. Asked Rev. Pike if he could stay in the cellar. +++$+++ 1990s
Right. Tell you what -- have you caviar? +++$+++ 1980s
You walked out on a job for me, and I won't ruin that. +++$+++ 1990s
Rub a dub dub, thanks for the grub, yay God. +++$+++ 1990s
Aside from the fact that he found her on an infomercial? She said they humped like gorillas. Chutney could hear them all the way in the pool house. +++$+++ 2000s
May I wash you? +++$+++ 1990s
'Least you admit it. +++$+++ 1990s
Pardon me?  I'm afraid I don't... +++$+++ 1990s
What are you doing? +++$+++ 1950s
-- I don't care about her. Of course, I was angry. But not with you. The book is yours not mine. I was wrong, what I said about it. I hurt you, didn't I? +++$+++ 1990s
Oh, well thanks a fucking bunch. +++$+++ 2000s
Ha, ha - who are you to be talking about a mask? What do you mean? You've been wearing a mask ever since we met you. +++$+++ 1930s
Hey Butt-Head, are we gonna die? +++$+++ 1990s
...Fine. +++$+++ 1970s
You're joking...! +++$+++ 1980s
I know it sounds funny, but I'm gonna try. +++$+++ 1980s
And now you're going to eat it? +++$+++ 1980s
In the village.  Look what I found. +++$+++ 2000s
In Angola. Yeah. +++$+++ 2000s
No. I just think... anything can be explained. But Mary, doing a thing like this... I don't know how to handle... +++$+++ 1960s
Yeah. I know. +++$+++ 2000s
...home. It's getting late. Yeah. +++$+++ 1990s
If I'm lucky.  So... I won't be back until the first. Your dad will be back on Sunday, so I've put Elizabeth in charge until then. She has the car... so she can drive you to your therapy tomorrow. +++$+++ 2000s
So what are you going to do about her? +++$+++ 1980s
Here's <u>weak</u>...Mom said she was gonna talk to the <u>teacher</u> and Brad's <u>parents</u>!!  Can you <u>believe</u> the <u>humiliation</u>??? +++$+++ 1990s
I've got an idea. +++$+++ 1980s
She knows enough not to be here. +++$+++ 1950s
I'm not going. +++$+++ 1990s
And the rest of us are truck horses? +++$+++ 1930s
Whatever I got, I always got on the slide. This shot's no different. I didn't earn nothin' -- I got it on the slide... I needed ya help about ten years ago when I was startin', but ya never helped me none. +++$+++ 1970s
Goodbye. I lov... +++$+++ 1990s
Must have been all the liquor in him. +++$+++ 1980s
So like I was saying, things were going pretty well in my life. +++$+++ 1990s
Rawlston is my boss. +++$+++ 1940s
Or a stock kick of approximately 125% on shares which are currently sitting around $4.38, or, in plain English... +++$+++ 1990s
What's this stuff on the rice? +++$+++ 1980s
Back-to-back sessions with the shrink. +++$+++ 2000s
What -- ? +++$+++ 2000s
Does that start exactly at midnight tomorrow, or could you hold off for a few days maybe? +++$+++ 1980s
Well, I just feel that life'll be much sweeter for you now with me around. I promise... +++$+++ 2000s
Mother, I promise you that he won't be a reporter much longer. Once I get him away from that atmosphere and get him away from a man named Gallagher— +++$+++ 1930s
We hear this is getting to be sort of a meeting place for the Wynant family, so we figure we'll stick around in case the old man himself shows up.  Then we seen him...  ...sneak in and we decide to come up.  And pretty lucky for you. +++$+++ 1930s
Three hundred kilos of White Lady hidden inside a giant bust of Abraham Lincoln.  A parade float. +++$+++ 2000s
Wonderful!  He liked the monkey, didn't you? +++$+++ 1980s
Notice the grain. See how deep and rich the red runs? +++$+++ 2000s
This is not my usual Friday night! +++$+++ 1980s
No way... +++$+++ 1980s
Best case scenario, you're back on the payroll for awhile. +++$+++ 1990s
Basic.  Hmmm. +++$+++ 1980s
Dad! +++$+++ 1990s
You made a mistake. +++$+++ 1990s
I have a feeling I'm about to start buying my own. +++$+++ 1990s
It's too bad about your mom. At least she went peacefully, I've seen a lot of people go out the hard way. +++$+++ 1990s
Head for the fireplace! +++$+++ 1980s
May I be blunt with you? +++$+++ 1990s
I ain't never seen a cat like you. Ain't you scared talking like that in front of an ofay? +++$+++ 1990s
Okay, well... anybody else have an idea? +++$+++ 2000s
He suspects that the culprits might be the very people who, uh, soiled your rug, and you're in a unique position to confirm or, uh, disconfirm that suspicion. +++$+++ 1990s
Jeff! +++$+++ 1990s
I've given them his profile. +++$+++ 1970s
Are we all museum bigots in Maine? +++$+++ 1990s
I judge military matters, Captain Winthrop, not you. +++$+++ 1970s
Did you write it—or didn't you? +++$+++ 1940s
Or was it the time you and Jimmy Squarefoot stole the golden apples I'd forged. +++$+++ 1980s
Can I see you again? +++$+++ 1990s
I said I like all of them. +++$+++ 1970s
Keeping our witnesses alive.  We hide them, but there's a leak in the department, and they end up dead. +++$+++ 1990s
To you?  I don't think so...  What'd she say? +++$+++ 2000s
I can't see Outpost putting its reputation in the hands of people like that. +++$+++ 2000s
You wouldn't know her address, would you? +++$+++ 1990s
Yeah, yeah. +++$+++ 2000s
Oh my god, It's real. +++$+++ 1990s
Showtime. +++$+++ 2000s
Not this. +++$+++ 1990s
They sent me here, Richard because they said you didn't hold up your end of the arrangement, and I have to transport you back to Leavenworth. +++$+++ 1990s
What? +++$+++ 1990s
You've gotta ask her to the dance! +++$+++ 1980s
I know I'm going to get rapped in the mouth for saying this, but so what? +++$+++ 1970s
We still talk, though. +++$+++ 1990s
You shouldn't be fighting with that jerk. +++$+++ 1980s
Bio-<u>busting</u>.  I <u>loves</u> bio-busting. Who do I gotta kill?  Family -- right?  Obnoxious I bet.  Mommie, daddy, piglets. +++$+++ 1980s
Yes, I do. I don't have amnesia. I remember everything about myself up until the incident. I'm Leonard Shelby, I'm from San Fran - +++$+++ 2000s
Well once. Mary. +++$+++ 1990s
Well, I guess that makes you the best.  Look, Frank -- she stands to inherit three million dollars.  As executors of the estate and her attorneys that could generate a lot of legal fees for us.  All I'm asking you to do is talk to her. +++$+++ 1990s
Now hold on, I didn't say I didn't want to come -- +++$+++ 1990s
No. +++$+++ 1960s
For mankind not a thing -- for womankind the record is not quite so bleak. +++$+++ 1930s
With four of them, I didn't use any kind of protection. Wait, maybe it was three. +++$+++ 1990s
As you wish... +++$+++ 1980s
You have a King fantasy. +++$+++ 1990s
He's not bad at it. +++$+++ 2000s
Are you going to lie in that flower bed all night? +++$+++ 2000s
W-w-what has that got to do with this Maiden? +++$+++ 2000s
Meanwhile whatever you do don't fall asleep. Midnight. +++$+++ 1980s
We're going to have to work on your touch. +++$+++ 1990s
Itta Bena, now, uh, that would be... +++$+++ 2000s
Right. +++$+++ 1980s
Now why don't you let these gentlemen pass? Don't you know who's in that car? +++$+++ 1950s
Isn't it enough that I can love you? +++$+++ 1980s
Thank you. +++$+++ 1960s
Get control of yourself! +++$+++ 2000s
There's a big, comfy California King over in Bedding.  What say we ... +++$+++ 1990s
I'm honored, Dick, that you've come all this way out here to Virginia to visit us at last. +++$+++ 1990s
Wow! +++$+++ 1990s
Who? +++$+++ 1920s
Carolyn! +++$+++ 1990s
How was the concert? +++$+++ 1950s
So then this isn't crazy.  It's a sure bet. +++$+++ 2000s
But I'm Miss Jessica's nurse, Alma. You don't have to do that for me. +++$+++ 1940s
Hey, pretty nifty, huh? +++$+++ 1940s
A lady. She died. +++$+++ 1990s
Nice disguise. +++$+++ 1990s
Well, then, w-who was? +++$+++ 1970s
I'm sorry, this can't wait. +++$+++ 1980s
Doctor Hegel tells me he discussed the Vietnam POW syndrome with you. +++$+++ 2000s
Bobo, no, I -- +++$+++ 1990s
Why? +++$+++ 1970s
Let me guess, she couldn't handle the cop thing -- never knowing if you were dead or alive.  I've seen it a million times. +++$+++ 2000s
What are you thinking? +++$+++ 1950s
One-three Zebra. Zebra three, I need you. +++$+++ 1990s
But, of course, there's nothing self- serving in that scenario. +++$+++ 1990s
Krueger? +++$+++ 1980s
I left the training early. +++$+++ 2000s
Is it true? +++$+++ 2000s
You didn't really believe me, did you? +++$+++ 1960s
Your life flashing before your eyes? +++$+++ 2000s
39   CONTINUED: +++$+++ 1990s
You know honey, I've finally figured out a way of bilking enough money from the school to get us that condo in Waikiki. +++$+++ 2000s
Just spit him back out.  Some shall live, some shall die, arbitrarily, sound like any higher power we know? +++$+++ 1990s
Forget it. +++$+++ 1970s
Mrs. Robinson? +++$+++ 1960s
We're not giving up, Thelma. +++$+++ 1990s
Nonsense, my friend. I can look on anything I like. And I am particularly fond of looking on crucifixes. +++$+++ 1990s
GOT THE HOT FLUSH SYMPTOMS AND I'M FEELING FREAKY +++$+++ 1980s
Yes! +++$+++ 1930s
They may have found her.  Mrs. Cortez -— this morning I told her Jacqueline was no longer under my care. +++$+++ 1940s
I'm not going to report it. +++$+++ 1990s
They give me fifty dollars when they turned me loose. I spent up some of it on ridin' the bus and eatin' french-fried potaters. +++$+++ 1990s
This isn't the time or the place to get into it, but there is, for just one example, a certain former colleague of mine, who made a very big mistake, a life mistake.  I think the lesson there is that, old and young, we ail make mistakes, and we have to learn that our actions, all of them, can carry serious consequences.  You're very young, Tracy underage, in fact -- but maybe one day you'll understand. +++$+++ 1990s
That the bombing in Dallas may have been to destroy the bodies of those firemen, so their deaths and the reason for them wouldn't have to be explained -- +++$+++ 1990s
Even later. +++$+++ 1980s
I hope I don't find any little hairy things living up here -- wait! There is something! If I can just -- yes, I'm getting it -- a case of some sort -- it's heavy. +++$+++ 1960s
Not the window - I can't bear the light anyway - no, I can see all the way to the desert.  I've found the lost fossils. +++$+++ 1990s
I'm only telling you what I've heard...  Haven't you ever wondered what your seed-mother was Like...? +++$+++ 1970s
What's in there, David!? +++$+++ 1970s
No -- it feels wonderful.  I've held that axe up for ages.  Oh --- +++$+++ 1930s

Why? +++$+++ 1970s
Very well, madam. I suppose you can't be blamed for being suspicious with so many scoundrels and rouges of the night about. Alex walks away from door, then ducks into the bushes where the others are hiding. They put on their maskies and follow Alex round to the rear of the house. +++$+++ 1970s

Because I don't want one. +++$+++ 1980s

I don't know shit about you. +++$+++ 2000s
I want to talk to you, Michael. +++$+++ 1970s
Oh, I know. But I didn't, really. Honestly, I didn't. There was only one, but he's out of town and leave no forwardin' address. +++$+++ 1990s
Yes. +++$+++ 1990s
Look, I care about the humans who are dying, not you, got it? +++$+++ 2000s

What are you doing in my room? +++$+++ 2000s
When did you get in? +++$+++ 1990s
Have you never been caught in a similar situation? +++$+++ 1930s

What are they doing in the middle of nowhere? +++$+++ 1990s
I'm here. +++$+++ 1990s
If Mulwray was murdered, she was probably one of the last people to see him. +++$+++ 1970s

But you was going to fight for me. +++$+++ 1970s
Sure, meet me at the top, we'll start the paperwork. +++$+++ 1990s
Believe it. +++$+++ 1980s
That's what you said the first time we met.  You didn't even know me. +++$+++ 1990s
Is that the one where the guy had knives for fingers? +++$+++ 1990s
Sounds wonderful. +++$+++ 1980s
I can't dude! We all took a sacred oath, and swore ourselves to secrecy! +++$+++ 1990s

I always figured I'd live longer without it. +++$+++ 1950s
Well, whatever the fuck it is, she used it. And then the spray perfume. You know, the real sweat kind -- and, on top of that, get this, right when we're crossing the Tri-boro bridge -- she changes her pantyhose! +++$+++ 1970s
Hey, where did you come from? +++$+++ 2000s
And people are actually fooled by that? +++$+++ 1990s
It would be worth the risk. +++$+++ 1990s
Here, take this out to the table. +++$+++ 1980s
What can I do for you, Mr. Kirby? +++$+++ 2000s
Huh? +++$+++ 2000s
I'm glad you care about us, Kicks. Sometimes that gets kind of lost in the racket -- +++$+++ 1940s
Timezit? +++$+++ 1970s
You must make the time.  Where do you go off to in the lunch hour? +++$+++ 1990s
But -- you have to go out there! I'll give you more than your one third!  When I get paid... just take the fall!  You're too hurt to fight and the man's a killer! +++$+++ 2000s
What? +++$+++ 1980s
And? +++$+++ 2000s
If I knew you any better I'd say that doesn't sound like you. +++$+++ 1990s
Now let's get this settled— +++$+++ 1930s
I wouldn't let happen. +++$+++ 1990s
I said you're going to get a phone call. +++$+++ 2000s

If it'll make you feel any better I won't do it again. +++$+++ 2000s
I just wanted to know if you're involved with anyone?  Let me ask you something?  Do your colleagues know if you're involved or not? +++$+++ 1990s
If you don't see it, it's not real... +++$+++ 2000s
He read the letters, Nick. Some day I wasn't there. He went through my room. He found your letters. +++$+++ 2000s
My brother is gonna shit. +++$+++ 1980s
And I know people. +++$+++ 2000s

You're nothing!  You're nobody!  You're a stupid dream.  Well all dreams come to an end. +++$+++ 1990s
There'll be three, four men at the most.  I have some backup, nothing will happen. +++$+++ 1990s

Good morning, Quince. +++$+++ 1990s

What's happenin'? +++$+++ 1990s
You OK, Bob? +++$+++ 1990s
I can't regotiate. +++$+++ 1990s
Yes that's the whole point. This is what I was put on this earth to do. Rape the town that raped my mother. Steal its pristine innocence like it stole hers. I've planned this since I was a very little boy. You have no real freedom either. Your father has cast a shadow that you've never eluded. +++$+++ 2000s
You have any children? +++$+++ 2000s
It had been deemed classified. +++$+++ 1990s
I -- I thought he was but... an impostor who resembled -- +++$+++ 1990s

Do you think they bought it? +++$+++ 1990s
...Hello? +++$+++ 2000s
The Morlocks didn't build this. +++$+++ 2000s
But you know, I should  really be the one going . +++$+++ 1990s
Yeah, okay. +++$+++ 1980s
Aw, don't tell me you're growin' scruples. +++$+++ 2000s
Front page.  Washington Post.  Tomorrow. +++$+++ 1990s
So what's the plan today? +++$+++ 2000s
A timer. +++$+++ 2000s
I'm still five.... +++$+++ 1980s
What are you waiting for? Do something. +++$+++ 1940s
You were in my way. +++$+++ 1990s
Excuse me. +++$+++ 1990s
Let me go, Dil +++$+++ 1990s
Huh? +++$+++ 1930s
Oh, gee, I don't know.  Um... +++$+++ 1980s
Ready. +++$+++ 1980s
Can I come in? +++$+++ 1980s
We head north, begin the grape tour up there, make our way south so the more we drink the closer we get to the motel. +++$+++ 2000s
Yeah.  That's how you end up with a 400 billion dollar deficit. +++$+++ 1990s
Plissken, slow down the sub. You're overloading the power plant. +++$+++ 1990s
He offered you money? +++$+++ 1980s
Granger and Pitts have one hell of a caseload... and I would have thought with Jetson here being the first Newcomer plainclothes, and Hubley's body being found over in the Newcomer community... +++$+++ 1980s
.Jeffrey!. Nobody wanted you to leave school and go to work in the store. maybe going back to school will be an option one day. I hope so. +++$+++ 1990s
Nothin'... You want to go for a drive? +++$+++ 1990s
Some kind of circuitry...? +++$+++ 1990s
Tippi-tippi-tim, tippi-tim, Tippi-tippi-tan, tippi-tan...  Gotta dime for a crippled-up docker? +++$+++ 1950s
She took them kids with her? +++$+++ 1950s
Juno! God, you startled me. What are you doing here? What's wrong? +++$+++ 2000s
What? +++$+++ 2000s
You know it's been over a year since we kicked it last?  Up at the family reunion. +++$+++ 2000s
Let's say a 10% finder's fee? +++$+++ 1990s
Mom.  I gotta talk to you. +++$+++ 1950s
Dude here. +++$+++ 1990s
Yes? +++$+++ 1990s
I mean…Your Majesty, they do not, they have not, but I believe there is one who can +++$+++ 1990s
For very long? +++$+++ 1970s
Wait till you see this -- we have the whole house to ourselves... +++$+++ 1990s
I can't do it anymore. +++$+++ 1990s
Anyway, they had to take her to Bellevue.  Maybe she'll stay this time. +++$+++ 1990s
Seconds.  Three, four. +++$+++ 1990s
The choices I made have led me here as well. This is the only home I have ever known. I cannot foresee a reason for leaving. +++$+++ 2000s
He likes her better than me. +++$+++ 1990s
Thank you. +++$+++ 1990s
We were suite mates. +++$+++ 2000s
I have to get back. I'm having dinner with the Danvers. +++$+++ 1980s
We are simply respecting the terms of the Seventeen Point Agreement. +++$+++ 1990s
Good.  You conquer the demon, but your horse is sinking in the bog.  What do you do? +++$+++ 1980s
But what makes a thought start? +++$+++ 1940s
Admiral Dougherty will not be joining us for diner. Deploy the collector.  Do you have a problem with those orders? +++$+++ 1990s
I'm listed. +++$+++ 1990s
That's how Congress--or any large body--is run. All work has to be done by committee. +++$+++ 1930s
<i>We gotta go to work, Domino.</i> +++$+++ 2000s
Do it! +++$+++ 1990s
It could be extremely useful to jog his memory. See if he remembers anything new the next day. And I'll have the test results back in a few days. +++$+++ 2000s
Almost. Want to sit up?  What's the matter? +++$+++ 2000s
I need a cigarette. +++$+++ 1990s
Everybody likes to be as good as their word. +++$+++ 1970s
Turned that place completely around.  180 degrees. +++$+++ 1990s
Yeah -- and nothing else.  That shock you? +++$+++ 1980s
Why wasn't I told? +++$+++ 1990s
Listen, I would - +++$+++ 1990s
Abbott and I used to do a lot of that in the spring. +++$+++ 1990s
Sure I do. +++$+++ 1980s
That's what turns me on about you, Dwight. You're so smart. +++$+++ 2000s
We're just alike. You think sex is so unimportant you don't do it. I think sex is so unimportant I don't care who I do it with. +++$+++ 1970s
It's as though he'd trapped a real cuckoo inside. +++$+++ 1980s
No more backward, if you ask me, than the way these hotshot assholes fuck us, then ditch us.  Don't you ever feel used, Paula? Don't you ever feel like if this is all you get for your trouble then the sonofabitch ought to be paying for it...? +++$+++ 1980s
I want to talk to her again, that's all.  See what would happen under, you know, normal circumstances. +++$+++ 1990s
Oh yeah,...I mean no. NO! I won't settle down! Not this time!... +++$+++ 1990s
You're pawning The Rock?! +++$+++ 2000s
'S all right, Grampa. You just kind a tar'd, that's all. Somebody fix a pallet. +++$+++ 1940s
I've thought of leaving, going to Chicago or New York, but... +++$+++ 1990s
Here you are, Senator. Not a bad desk, either. Daniel Webster used to use it. +++$+++ 1930s
[Beat] I know it doesn't make sense. It doesn't even make sense to me. +++$+++ 2000s
I'm sending.  Do you hear me? +++$+++ 1970s
What are we gonna see? +++$+++ 1990s
...excuse me.  Can you fix this? +++$+++ 1990s
My...wings... +++$+++ 1990s
He does it all by himself. +++$+++ 2000s
What does this have to do with my testimony? +++$+++ 1990s
Why? +++$+++ 1990s
It's from both of us.  Of course you'll have to drive it around the lot until you get your permit -- +++$+++ 2010s
When's the next Jumbo? +++$+++ 2000s
Don't you know?  How they're talking about you? +++$+++ 1990s
Just a night out.  Sounds like she can't say no to her daughter. +++$+++ 1990s
Victor. This has got to stop.  Nobody's seen you in months. You haven't attended a single class. +++$+++ 1930s
Whatever. +++$+++ 2000s
He's my sister's kid. No papa. Not too bright. Personally, I think he's a retard. I only gave him the job as a favor for my sister, you understand? +++$+++ 1990s
Well, let's find him. +++$+++ 1990s
Go! +++$+++ 1990s
Indeedldid, MyLord. Itwas one ofthe first to cross. +++$+++ 1970s
Fucker! +++$+++ 1990s
He's not here.  It's a blind alley. +++$+++ 1990s
You better believe I can.  I'm sick of people telling me what I have to do. +++$+++ 1990s
Oh no. She's here. I brought him along. And my daughter, too. We're staying at Peterson's... +++$+++ 1990s
Oh! +++$+++ 1980s
"... by the emperor of Rome.  This writer asks:  between a Senate that debates truth until they choke, an Emperor who has the birth sign of a woman, is it possible there is more virtue within the arena than without?" +++$+++ 2000s
What work? +++$+++ 1990s
You closed him yesterday. +++$+++ 1990s
Sorry. My life isn't that interesting. I go to work. I go home. I don't know what to say. +++$+++ 2000s
I don't believe it. +++$+++ 1990s
Remember -- we can't take more than five minutes to get out. +++$+++ 1960s
Lots of people... +++$+++ 2000s
Let me just clarify a few things.  I don't care what kind of cop you are in China, you have no jurisdiction in America.  Without me you are just another tourist. +++$+++ 1990s
About a year. +++$+++ 2000s
It's Janine Melnitz, from my staff.  She's one of my most valuable employees. +++$+++ 1980s
I want to say something. +++$+++ 1970s
You know what I'm talking about. +++$+++ 1990s
It depends on the quality. And, that it be Indian. +++$+++ 1990s
Sounds familiar. +++$+++ 2000s
You know him? +++$+++ 1990s
Since last night. I was pleased to see you. +++$+++ 2000s
Pam Grier. +++$+++ 1990s
Great to be here. +++$+++ 2000s
Yeah. +++$+++ 1990s
...that’s our war room. We did seven major deals last year, three of them hostile. +++$+++ 2000s
But not now. +++$+++ 1930s
Here's one by a man that's very much alive. +++$+++ 1970s
What happens if I can't catch him? +++$+++ 1990s
That's right and I'll smash your face for you, yarblockos. Slide of watch shop. +++$+++ 1970s
What are you saying? +++$+++ 1960s
You don't have an investigation without me.  You got that? +++$+++ 1990s
They can't impeach me for bombing Cambodia.  The President can bomb anybody he wants. +++$+++ 1990s
I'm sure you're quite willing to be decent about this. +++$+++ 1930s
A pass? How you gonna give me a pass? A witness can put me at the crime scene. +++$+++ 2000s
Yes, I did. +++$+++ 1980s
I don't get it. +++$+++ 1990s
If I thought I could get away with it - +++$+++ 1990s
Yes. +++$+++ 1980s
That's not important now, Elaine.  We have to talk. +++$+++ 1980s
No, I haven't heard. +++$+++ 1970s
He wanted to know how you used to like your eggs. +++$+++ 1990s
I don't know what the fuck you're doin'. You're givin' us a ride. +++$+++ 1990s
What are you talking about? +++$+++ 1990s
Sure. +++$+++ 2000s
The maitre d' called you Christine. +++$+++ 1990s
Leave him alone, Lennon, or I'll tell them all the truth about you. +++$+++ 1960s
Sh-h-h Nancy. The other children. +++$+++ 1940s
I am.  Please come with me.  I don't want to do this here. +++$+++ 2000s
Tomorrow night. +++$+++ 1990s
Stop fighting and get out. +++$+++ 1990s
My only fear is that the Zulu will avoid the engagement +++$+++ 1970s
Am I cool now? +++$+++ 2000s
That's good. +++$+++ 1970s
I sprayed your apartment. I took your key. I really didn't mean to do anything but see you. +++$+++ 1980s
You're late. +++$+++ 1980s
Why? +++$+++ 1990s
Yes, it's on the stove... +++$+++ 1990s
I moving more to Communism now it's dying out. +++$+++ 2000s
See, we're getting along famously! +++$+++ 1930s
Okay, Sandy. +++$+++ 1980s
I believe he is probably lying. +++$+++ 1980s
Make your teeth yella -- +++$+++ 1970s
You're a little old to be a school boy aren't you brother.  Cool it! You're probably not the only one they've gone after. Stall a little so they believe you're for real. Make them trust you.  Hey Tyrone, you figure feeding our children is gonna make The Man jumpy? +++$+++ 1990s
I can hear myself starting out. "Your Honor -- I have a friend who's an amateur sleuth, an one night, after a heavy supper --"  He'd throw the New York State Penal Code right in my face. -- And it's six volumes. +++$+++ 1950s
You invented Space Paranoids? +++$+++ 1980s
Of course not. +++$+++ 1970s
I do!!! +++$+++ 1970s
Sixteen 'C', why? +++$+++ 1980s
This is our world you're entering.  You may see things -- feeding.  Just remember why you're here. +++$+++ 2000s
Shut up! +++$+++ 2000s
It -- it doesn't matter, Mother!  He is dead now!  Dead! +++$+++ 1990s
Hope. +++$+++ 1970s
English! English, you stupid little retard! We America now, Tina! +++$+++ 1990s
Then we don't know if she's part of this or not.  Mickey, you up? +++$+++ 2000s
So now I see where you're coming from.  Just because we ain't rapping about Gucci, Timberland, Rolex, Benz, Cristal, ho's and bitches, we're pseudo. +++$+++ 2000s
I've got a pretty good idea. You're here to kill me, so kill me. You want me to be afraid, but I'm not. I don't care who you are, or why you two killed my husband... +++$+++ 2000s
Then tough luck, George, because you are. +++$+++ 1990s
Shhhhhh...  Thank you, gentlemen... I'll look after her now... +++$+++ 1990s
AGAGAH!! +++$+++ 1990s
Well, I'm coming to it. It seems the Professor had to have a gun to re- enact the crime with -- and who do you suppose supplied it? Nobody else but that great thinker, Sheriff Hartman! +++$+++ 1940s
Ahm right, right, I liked the bit in space very much.  Did you enjoy making 	that bit? +++$+++ 1990s
We think he's had a change of heart.  So we should be celebrating. +++$+++ 1990s
We own a small family grocery store. +++$+++ 2000s
She doesn't want me around +++$+++ 1980s
A very short while, Uncle. I've been given permission to stay only a few days. +++$+++ 1960s
So I can't talk to some broken down actor, what do you think, I'm going to tell him I'm screwing Lester Karpf! +++$+++ 1970s
Not have it. +++$+++ 2000s
Thank you very much. +++$+++ 1930s
Why'd he come in our camp. +++$+++ 1990s
You said he was dead. +++$+++ 2000s
...in a really horrible way. +++$+++ 1980s
Tell, tell, tell me again. +++$+++ 1990s
I never been to a commune. I don't know. I saw pictures in a magazine, and it didn't look very clean to me. +++$+++ 1970s
God, Viktor.  Why do you always have to make things so difficult for yourself? +++$+++ 2010s
I *can't* wait, McGann! You go into that room and tell Jim Taylor and Joe Paine that I give them *one more minute*-- +++$+++ 1930s
Not "whatever."  It's two different things. +++$+++ 2000s
Shift to your left. +++$+++ 2000s
DO IT! NOW -- ! +++$+++ 2000s
So we have two choices.  Either our suspect came back to the murder scene for a drink of water and I don't know anybody that thirsty or...  ...he <i>is</i> here.  We test again.  You're right, Hugo, this was a desperate act.  Someone had a lot to lose that night--perhaps their place in line.  I'd like the profiles of everyone with an upcoming mission. +++$+++ 1990s
Around... +++$+++ 2000s
I'm sorry, that damn conference-- +++$+++ 1990s
Airborne. That's where they used to get us agents from. Now we get 'em from Carnegie-Melon, Ivy League. Accountants and computer whiz-kids. Yuppies with guns.  That's scary shit. +++$+++ 1990s
You mean Camp Sixty-Nine. +++$+++ 1990s
Uh, so head for the other end of the tunnel. +++$+++ 1990s
This is very good for us. +++$+++ 1970s
These rooms are solid stone. They haven't changed. +++$+++ 1990s
Oh, Jesus! Did you see what god just did to us? +++$+++ 1990s
I am confused. Or maybe it's you. +++$+++ 1980s
Poppa Joe said there was only two. In and out.  Boy, you guys sure did a good job. You're good, huh? Cool masks. Where'd you get them? +++$+++ 1990s
You do not report for duty unless the Queen requests it.  You know that very well. +++$+++ 1990s
I'll find something that won't kill them. +++$+++ 2000s
Pooch, can you move it? +++$+++ 2000s
Beyond reason.  The feminist warrior will rise up in this kid, and she'll be standing over his sleeping form with a butcher knife, selecting from a short list of body parts! +++$+++ 1990s
We're on the move. Let's go. As they walk toward a corridor. +++$+++ 1980s
That was some going-over your men gave my place this afternoon. We just barely got cleaned up in time to open. +++$+++ 1940s
Dignan, he's my brother. I can't just leave him there. +++$+++ 1990s
SIN-I-FUL +++$+++ 1980s
And you weren't involved. +++$+++ 1920s
Her name is Kristen. She disappeared a couple of months ago. +++$+++ 1970s
It don't look together. +++$+++ 1990s
Might I ask why? +++$+++ 2000s
Not in your nature. +++$+++ 1990s
-- in the act. +++$+++ 1990s
Sure. +++$+++ 1980s
People have tried this before, Jake. It's never worked. Teddy Fraiser and his crew went on vacation in Chicago for it. Last year, Mumps got pinched in L.A. +++$+++ 2000s
I regret I can't spend the time I'd like with your exhibition, but I'm going to worry the life out of you when I come back. +++$+++ 1930s
Hotcha character. If I had to live with your cynicism, I wouldn't want to live at all. What you can't understand is that the creative forces of the universe are positive, not negative. +++$+++ 1990s
You in business with those guys or what?  I wouldn't want a problem for the establishment, Bern. +++$+++ 1990s
Well you're a writer, and a lot of writers are gay. Look at Truman Capote. +++$+++ 1990s
How does Mother know what I like to do? +++$+++ 1960s
Oh, yes. Come in, Paul. Rex will be right out. +++$+++ 1980s
You're late! +++$+++ 1980s
Only in your bones? +++$+++ 2000s
I've booked you in for a chest X-ray . . . just to be on the safe side. +++$+++ 1990s
Let her go. +++$+++ 2000s
I'm going to show you how to wash this tile and then you're going to do it. +++$+++ 1990s
Working the what? +++$+++ 1990s
Your parents would be crushed to think you weren't happy with it. +++$+++ 2000s
Hey, Cindy. Your friend needs help. +++$+++ 2000s
Well, until you know, you can't go. +++$+++ 2000s
The Republican Party was never home to extremists.  You should know better. This guy's as stupid as McCarthy, and McCarthy never did you any good in the long run, now did he? +++$+++ 1990s
Because it feels really incredibly good. +++$+++ 1990s
Not so far as I'm concerned, you're not.  Yes? +++$+++ 1930s
You're quicker than usual. +++$+++ 2000s
Yeah, he thinks he's evolved to a higher plane of existence, or something.  Maybe he has.  You've seen him surf... that frenzy.  It seems like anger.  It's not.  It's the energy of lovemaking.  The sea is the woman in his life.  She's his only true lover. +++$+++ 1990s
As far as the office. +++$+++ 1970s
What's the story? +++$+++ 1970s
With all due respect, detective, you can't go blaming every brutal murder in Illinois on Michael Meyers. +++$+++ 1990s
Yes I did.    Lose ends are messy. +++$+++ 2000s
Oh, he did. +++$+++ 2000s
Sit down. I don't want to trouble you, just want to ask... +++$+++ 1960s
Well, yes... +++$+++ 2000s
Well. The prom's coming up. +++$+++ 2000s
Let's go out back and have some coca while the men are talking. +++$+++ 1960s
Now wait a minute! +++$+++ 1970s
Munro is expecting him to be the good soldier in defense of British military interests. +++$+++ 1970s
Oh, confound it, man, are you afraid of success? I'm offering you a three year contract at twenty thousand dollars a year, starting today. Is it a deal or isn't it? +++$+++ 1940s
I'm out here for you!  You don't know what it's like to be me out here for you. It is an up-at-dawn pride-swallowing seige that I will never fully tell you about! Okay?! Help me help you help me help you. +++$+++ 1990s
Is it now?  Hanna?  I think we'll take our tea down by the swimming pool. +++$+++ 1990s
He asked for a loan of it, didn't he? +++$+++ 1930s
Well, you know, you don't have to tell her everything.  I mean, nothing really happened.  We just... took a walk. +++$+++ 1990s
Oh, I see. I beg your pardon. +++$+++ 1940s
I don't know. +++$+++ 1970s
No, you gotta understand, Valiant, I had nothin' to do with Acme gettin' killed.  I just wanted to sell my studio.  But they wouldn't buy my property unless Acme would sell his. And he wouldn't.  So I was gonna blackmail Acme with pictures of him and the rabbit's wife. +++$+++ 1980s
Georgia, where I come from, it's real if you make it yourself. But I been buying from the Yankee Government since they put me in this soldier suit and give me a rate. +++$+++ 1970s
Ballistic penetration shocks it, but only for a few seconds. +++$+++ 1990s
Very romantic. +++$+++ 1990s
Another hotel. Down the road. Martin lives there. He took your money. He’s got a safe...  I need a doctor... +++$+++ 1990s
Did I do good? +++$+++ 1990s
Fine, but I'm not gonna be no Bulldog Omega 5. +++$+++ 2000s
You have proof? +++$+++ 1980s
Hey,  that's... cute... Do you have a nickname, something a little... shorter? +++$+++ 1990s
One minute I'm minding my own business, the next thing I know the whole place is burning up.  An oxygen tank must've blown on the welder. Started an oil fire. +++$+++ 2000s
Shhh... Car thieves are your weakness. +++$+++ 2000s
Ellie... even if you do manage to raise the money, have you thought about what it would really mean to follow through on this?  I mean a college fetish is one thing, but we're talking about your career. You won't be publishing.  You won't be taken seriously... and you could spend your entire life looking and never find anything at all. +++$+++ 1990s
Have you told someone? +++$+++ 2000s
Don't fuck with me, Nick.  I don't need a reason to put your ass in a sling. +++$+++ 1990s
In time. +++$+++ 1970s
Let's go. +++$+++ 2000s
We don't need a new jail. +++$+++ 1990s
Jesus Christ, George, I don't see you in two years, and you show up at my door with a hundred and ten pounds of cocaine? +++$+++ 2000s
Nobody knows. +++$+++ 1980s
Yes, Patrick? +++$+++ 2000s
Wednesday, Thursday, Friday. +++$+++ 1990s
Thank you. +++$+++ 1970s
I'd like to make something clear. I don't go after a girl; a girl comes to me. Her choice. Right? +++$+++ 1970s
May I come in? +++$+++ 1990s
What is wrong with you? +++$+++ 1990s
...and the winds of destiny carry you aloft... +++$+++ 2000s
Right away, Exposition. +++$+++ 1990s
In the Arctic ice. +++$+++ 1980s
Barbara -- +++$+++ 2000s
...your sentences!  They're our sentences.  Get your mind around that. +++$+++ 1990s
You know something? +++$+++ 1930s
Why? Did you have too many and you fear it may shock me?  I won't get shocked. I'm used to this!  My father was a true pig. He fucked the bitch I'd as mother all around the apartment. Whenever a door was closed, you could be sure they were making sex behind it!  And my sister, if you didn't sleep with her, you're building's exception! +++$+++ 1990s
I breached protocol. I broke contact with the S.A.C. I ignored a primary tactical rule and left him alone with the device. +++$+++ 1990s
Like a nylon lemon peel- +++$+++ 1950s
Knight ... +++$+++ 1990s
So? +++$+++ 1990s
No, you talkin' at me. +++$+++ 1990s
If you want a ringside table, tell 'em you're one of the pall bearers. +++$+++ 1950s
Wrong number. +++$+++ 1990s
<u>You</u> left me. +++$+++ 1980s
I dunno.  What's he gonna say?  They had a fight that night, she drove away, she was upset?  I don't even know the guy. Don't get me wrong, Jenny and me were friends, but we didn't travel in the same social circles.  She had her life, I had mine. +++$+++ 1990s
Come on, now--you've forgotten all about that. +++$+++ 1930s
You just sat around drinking orange juice. Now look at you. Look how far you've come in just a few months. You got that part in that movie... +++$+++ 1990s
What the hell is the President trying to do?  Steal DeHaven's thunder? +++$+++ 1990s
The both of you. +++$+++ 2000s
I don't reckon I know. +++$+++ 1990s
Do you happen to know Gustavus Adolphus, the thirteenth Earl of Crabs? +++$+++ 1970s
Really?  I was looking at some figures from the Sickness and Accident Claims Division -- do you know that the average New Yorker between the ages of twenty and fifty has two and a half colds a year? +++$+++ 1960s
I'll give you something. +++$+++ 1990s
Because you don't really seem here. +++$+++ 1990s
Call her sister! If no one's answering at the house.... +++$+++ 1960s
From other people!  I believe she is not crazy, nor is she lying. +++$+++ 1980s
Father, are you okay? +++$+++ 2000s
It's yours? +++$+++ 1990s
By the way, Jack, this looks like a pretty straight-forward transaction to me, but we should get into it soon -- just take a few minutes, maybe up at the house ... +++$+++ 1990s
Jack's pinned down Sarah.  Should be a second.  Keep dancing. +++$+++ 1990s
Not against Castle Dugan gate, that has been off the hinges these ten years. +++$+++ 1970s
Where ya comin' from, young man? +++$+++ 1990s
I think it's time we got one thing perfectly clear, Willa. Marriage to me represents a blending of two spirits in the sight of Heaven. +++$+++ 1950s
You really want to do this, don't you? +++$+++ 1980s
No way out.  No way out.  What?  Who? +++$+++ 1960s
I think this is worth a dollar. +++$+++ 1990s
God, David. Just give it to me! +++$+++ 1990s
She's rabid, but cute. +++$+++ 1990s
Is this becoming complicated? +++$+++ 1990s
I told you, leave the boys in Washington to the boys downtown and the boys down... +++$+++ 1980s
That's how he got so big. When he quit the Marines he was just a little guy. +++$+++ 1990s
Gear? +++$+++ 1960s
Well leave then. Go to Hell. +++$+++ 1990s
My god damn foot is gone! Who fuckin' shot me? Who fuckin' shot me!? +++$+++ 2000s
Well -- other departments are, yes. +++$+++ 1990s
Now I understand why the soldier went away just before the end. That's right, just one more night and the princess would have been his. But she, also, could not have kept her promise. And...that would have been terrible, he would have died from it. So instead, for ninety-nine nights at least he had lived with the illusion that she was there waiting for him... +++$+++ 1980s
I don't recollect ever being compared to a pistol before. +++$+++ 1990s
No, I suppose not. How do you feel about your mother? +++$+++ 1970s
None.  This was arranged. +++$+++ 2000s
NO WAY! +++$+++ 1990s
How did you get him to part with it, Mr. Kane? +++$+++ 1940s
I spaced out. +++$+++ 2000s
What about them? +++$+++ 1960s
Look, girls -- I'll stay behind and hold them off. The rest of you break for it! +++$+++ 1980s
That's not possible. +++$+++ 1980s
You think I got any kind of a voice? +++$+++ 1970s
Quiet, please. Everyone. +++$+++ 2000s
I'm so sorry.  Krieger was my call.  I've never worked with him.  I'm sorry, Ethan. +++$+++ 1990s
Would someone please come over here and... +++$+++ 1990s
Aw, Long John . . . I tell you—it's no good. You're gonna get used to a lotta stuff that's gonna wreck you. Why, that fifty bucks in your pocket's beginning to show up on you already. And don't pull that on me neither! +++$+++ 1940s
Majesty... We have more than enough food set aside for your birthday celebration next week.  If we distributed some of that, we would have time to gather more before -- +++$+++ 1990s
You too big. +++$+++ 2000s
I'll give you a fucking hoot if you don't shut up back there. +++$+++ 2000s
And it's over...? +++$+++ 1980s
What, it's worse? You're pregnant with an Asian design major's child? +++$+++ 1990s
Big time.  And news travels fast. Wouldn't be surprised if the whole school knows about this one by tonight. +++$+++ 1990s
Oh! +++$+++ 1930s
You know a lot. You've taken a lot of fancy courses in colleges and that kind of stuff - - what kind of a man would kill like that? +++$+++ 1940s
About five miles back. +++$+++ 1980s
You knew Del?! +++$+++ 2000s
I'll get the doctor. +++$+++ 1980s
Don't mind the smell.  I think a rat died behind the wall... My Susie was a good girl! +++$+++ 1990s
Ohh! +++$+++ 1970s
I'm... I'm just delivering a package. +++$+++ 1970s
I just had a drive; besides, I want to see my brother-in-law Michael. +++$+++ 1970s
I'm just saying that you seem like a smart guy.  At a certain point you're gonna do something, and then there's no turning back... +++$+++ 2000s
I had a family once -- a wife, three daughters. Then a drifter named Deacon Frost came calling one evening -- +++$+++ 1990s
I need your help. +++$+++ 2000s
Energy! And when they say "Energy" what do they mean? Nuclear? too dangerous. Solar?? Too underdeveloped. +++$+++ 1980s
